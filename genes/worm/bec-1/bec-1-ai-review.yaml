description: BEC-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of yeast Atg6/Vps30 and mammalian 
  Beclin-1, functioning as an essential scaffold/adaptor subunit of the class 
  III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. BEC-1 assembles with VPS-34 
  (the catalytic PI3K subunit) and VPS-15 to form complexes that generate 
  phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) on membranes. In the PI3KC3-C1 
  complex (with EPG-8/ATG14), BEC-1 promotes autophagosome nucleation at 
  ER-derived omegasomes. In the PI3KC3-C2 complex (with UVRAG/VPS-38), BEC-1 
  supports endocytic trafficking, endosome-to-Golgi retrograde transport, and 
  phagosome maturation. BEC-1 also interacts with CED-9 (BCL-2 family) to 
  negatively regulate apoptosis. The protein is essential for dauer 
  morphogenesis, lifespan extension in insulin signaling mutants, survival 
  during starvation, clearance of apoptotic corpses, germline stem cell 
  proliferation, and protection against protein aggregation toxicity.

    review:
      summary: BEC-1 is a core component of the PI3KC3-C1 complex that initiates
        autophagosome formation. Evidence from PMID:12958363 demonstrates that 
        bec-1 is essential for autophagosome formation in seam cells during 
        dauer development. BEC-1 functions with VPS-34 to generate PtdIns3P at 
        phagophore assembly sites, which is required for recruitment of 
        downstream autophagy machinery including LGG-1/LC3.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a core molecular function of BEC-1 as the Beclin ortholog.
        Multiple studies confirm BEC-1's essential role in autophagosome 
        assembly as part of the PI3KC3 complex.

    review:
      summary: Mitophagy is a selective form of autophagy that degrades 
        mitochondria. While BEC-1 is essential for general autophagy, there is 
        limited direct experimental evidence specifically demonstrating BEC-1's 
        role in mitophagy in C. elegans. The IBA annotation is based on 
        phylogenetic inference from mammalian Beclin-1.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: As a core component of the autophagy initiation complex, BEC-1 
        would be required for mitophagy, which is a selective form of 
        macroautophagy. The phylogenetic inference is sound given the conserved 
        role of Beclin/Atg6 proteins in all forms of autophagy.

        (EPG-8/ATG14, UVRAG) and regulatory proteins (CED-9, SORF-1, SORF-2). 
        BEC-1 does not have enzymatic activity itself but positions VPS-34 to 
        generate PtdIns3P at appropriate membrane sites.
