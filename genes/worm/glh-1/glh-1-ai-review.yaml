description: GLH-1 (Germline Helicase 1) is a Vasa/DDX4-class ATP-dependent DEAD-box
  RNA helicase that is a constitutive component of germline-specific P granules in
  C. elegans. The protein contains an N-terminal region with FGG (phenylalanine-glycine-glycine)
  repeats that promote perinuclear anchoring via FG-nucleoporins, four CCHC-type zinc
  fingers for RNA binding, and a central DEAD-box helicase domain. GLH-1 functions
  through an ATP hydrolysis cycle to remodel ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) in
  the germline. Its ATPase activity is essential for P granule assembly/disassembly
  dynamics, as demonstrated by mutational analysis (DAAD alleles disperse GLH-1 from
  granules while DQAD alleles cause dominant aggregation). GLH-1 coordinates the perinuclear
  recruitment of Argonaute proteins (PRG-1, CSR-1, WAGO-1) and is essential for piRNA/22G-RNA
  silencing pathways, germ cell development, and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.
  It functions redundantly with GLH-4 in maintaining germline integrity.

  review:
    summary: GLH-1 is confirmed as an ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase. The protein
      contains the characteristic DEAD motif and helicase domains. Functional studies
      demonstrate that ATPase cycle mutations (DAAD and DQAD) profoundly affect GLH-1
      localization and function, confirming enzymatic activity (Chen et al., 2020;
      Marnik et al., 2019).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core molecular function well-supported by domain architecture (DEAD-box
      helicase domain, RecA-like core) and functional studies. IBA annotation is phylogenetically
      sound given conservation with Vasa/DDX4 family.

    summary: Original characterization of GLH-1 as a putative RNA helicase based on
      sequence analysis showing DEAD-box motifs and CCHC zinc fingers. While direct
      biochemical helicase activity was not demonstrated in vitro in this paper, the
      domain architecture strongly supports this function.

      show GLH-1 associates with RNA-binding proteins and Argonautes in an RNA-dependent

      is involved in RNA metabolism through its role in RNP remodeling and small RNA

    reason: While GLH-1 is involved in RNA metabolism, this term is very broad. More
      specific terms related to small RNA pathways (piRNA, 22G-RNA) or RNP remodeling

  review:
    summary: GLH-1 acts redundantly with GLH-4 to regulate P granule structure. RNAi
      knockdown of glh-1 in a glh-4 mutant background results in smaller P granules

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the precise mechanism by which GLH-1's ATPase cycle controls P
    granule liquid-liquid phase separation dynamics? Studies show DAAD mutations disperse
    GLH-1 while DQAD mutations cause aggregation, but the molecular basis for how
    ATP hydrolysis controls condensate behavior is not fully understood.
- question: Does GLH-1 directly bind and remodel piRNA precursors or other specific
    RNA substrates, or is its helicase activity primarily involved in general RNP
    remodeling? While GLH-1 is clearly required for piRNA pathway function, it is
    unclear whether it directly processes piRNA precursors or acts indirectly through
    P granule organization.
- question: What is the functional significance of GLH-1's interaction with ZYX-1
    (zyxin-like protein)? The ZYX-1 interaction was identified by yeast two-hybrid
    but zyx-1 deletion has no obvious phenotype, leaving the functional relevance
    unclear. Could this connect P granules to the cytoskeleton?
- question: How do GLH-1 and GLH-4 divide their redundant and non-redundant functions
    in different developmental contexts? Single mutants have mild phenotypes but double
    mutants are sterile, suggesting both redundancy and specialization that is not
    well characterized.
suggested_experiments:
- description: In vitro helicase assays with purified GLH-1 to directly measure RNA
    unwinding activity and characterize substrate specificity. Despite being classified
    as a DEAD-box RNA helicase, direct biochemical demonstration of helicase activity
    has not been published for GLH-1.
- description: CLIP-seq or similar RNA-protein crosslinking to identify direct RNA
    targets of GLH-1 in vivo. Would clarify whether GLH-1 has specific RNA substrates
    (e.g., piRNA precursors) or acts broadly on germline transcripts.
- description: Cryo-EM or structural studies of GLH-1 in different ATPase states bound
    to RNA substrates. Would reveal how ATP cycle controls RNA binding and how mutations
    affect protein conformation and condensate behavior.
- description: Live imaging of fluorescently tagged GLH-1 in ATPase mutant backgrounds
    during embryogenesis and adult germline development. Would provide dynamic view
    of how ATPase cycle controls P granule behavior at different developmental stages.
