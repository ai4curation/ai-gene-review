description: LOV-1 (Location Of Vulva defective 1) is the C. elegans ortholog of
  human PKD1/Polycystin-1. It is a large membrane protein with multiple 
  transmembrane domains, a PLAT domain, and a GPS autoproteolytic cleavage site.
  LOV-1 functions as part of a mechanosensory receptor complex with PKD-2 (the 
  C. elegans TRPP2/Polycystin-2 ortholog) in male-specific sensory neurons. This
  complex is required for male mating behaviors, specifically response to 
  hermaphrodite contact and vulva location. LOV-1 localizes to sensory cilia in 
  ray neurons, hook neurons, and cephalic (CEM) neurons of adult males. The 
  protein interacts with ATP-2 (F1-ATP synthase beta subunit) via its PLAT 
  domain, with casein kinase II regulatory subunit KIN-10, and with STAM-1 for 
  endosomal trafficking. LOV-1 and PKD-2 act in the same genetic pathway, as 
  double mutants show no enhancement over single mutants.

    review:
      summary: LOV-1 is a multi-pass transmembrane protein with 11 predicted 
        transmembrane helices according to UniProt. The membrane annotation is 
        well-supported by phylogenetic inference across polycystin family 
        members.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: LOV-1 is clearly a membrane protein based on its domain 
        architecture (multiple TM domains, GPS region, PLAT domain). UniProt 
        annotation indicates "Multi-pass membrane protein" and the IBA 
        annotation is consistent with polycystin family conservation.

      label: calcium channel activity
    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: The IBA annotation infers calcium channel activity based on 
        polycystin family membership. In mammals, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 
        form a mechanosensitive cation channel. However, direct evidence for 
        LOV-1 having intrinsic calcium channel activity is limited; rather, 
        LOV-1 appears to function as a receptor that partners with the TRP 
        channel PKD-2.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: LOV-1 is a PC1-family member that partners with the TRPP channel 
        PKD-2. The channel activity likely resides primarily in PKD-2, while 
        LOV-1 functions as a receptor component of the complex. A more accurate 
        annotation would be "calcium channel regulator activity" or simply 
        retain the broader "cation channel activity" annotation if the complex 
        is considered a functional unit. However, given the IBA evidence across 
        the polycystin family, this annotation is not entirely wrong but may be 
        an over-annotation for LOV-1 specifically.

    review:
      summary: This annotation is inferred from the calcium channel activity 
        annotation. Since the calcium channel activity annotation is 
        questionable for LOV-1 specifically (channel activity may reside 
        primarily in PKD-2), this inferred annotation is similarly uncertain.

      reason: LOV-1 is part of a receptor-channel complex with PKD-2. The 
        transport activity is more directly attributable to PKD-2. LOV-1's role 
        is as a receptor/regulatory component. This annotation follows from the 
        MF annotation which may be an over-annotation.
