## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q23424
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Transmembrane GTPase fzo-1; EC=3.6.5.- {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8IWA4};
- **Gene Information:** Name=fzo-1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:ZK1248.14}; ORFNames=ZK1248.14 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:ZK1248.14};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the TRAFAC class dynamin-like GTPase
- **Key Domains:** Dynamin_N. (IPR045063); Fzo/mitofusin_HR2. (IPR006884); G_DYNAMIN_dom. (IPR030381); Mitofusin_fam. (IPR027094); P-loop_NTPase. (IPR027417)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "fzo-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'fzo-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **fzo-1** (gene ID: fzo-1, UniProt: Q23424) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Comprehensive research report: fzo-1 (C. elegans mitofusin; UniProt Q23424)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein identity and family: fzo-1 encodes FZO-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of metazoan mitofusins (MFN1/MFN2), which are large, TRAFAC-class dynamin-like GTPases that catalyze outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) tethering and fusion. FZO-1 functions in mitochondrial outer-membrane fusion, whereas EAT-3 (OPA1 ortholog) catalyzes inner-membrane (IMM) fusion; both are required for complete mitochondrial fusion. Localization: FZO-1 is an integral OMM protein. GTP hydrolysis by the conserved P-loop NTPase domain powers conformational changes needed for membrane tethering/fusion. URLs: Fu et al., Nat Commun, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14885-x (Feb 2020); Haeussler et al., G3, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab095 (Mar 2021); Westermann, Semin Cell Dev Biol, 2010, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2009.12.003 (Aug 2010); Köhler thesis, 2020, https://doi.org/10.5282/edoc.27226 (Jan 2020). (fu2020woundingtriggersmiro1 pages 1-2, haeussler2021genomewidernaiscreen pages 3-4, westermann2010mitochondrialdynamicsin pages 4-5, kohler2020analysisofthe pages 13-16)

2) Molecular architecture and enzymatic activity
- Domains/architecture: FZO-1 belongs to mitofusin family with an N-terminal dynamin-like GTPase domain and coiled-coil heptad-repeat regions (e.g., HR2) that mediate trans-OMM tethering. Metazoan mitofusins contain C-terminal regions projecting into the intermembrane space important for fusogenic activity. FZO-1’s activity is GTP-dependent (dynamin-like GTPase; EC 3.6.5.-). URL: Köhler 2020, https://doi.org/10.5282/edoc.27226 (Jan 2020). (kohler2020analysisofthe pages 13-16)

3) Subcellular localization and primary function
- Localization: OMM-resident mitofusin ortholog. Function: mediates OMM fusion; productive mitochondrial fusion in vivo requires sequential OMM fusion by FZO-1 and IMM fusion by EAT-3/OPA1. URLs: Haeussler 2021, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab095 (Mar 2021); Fu 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14885-x (Feb 2020). (haeussler2021genomewidernaiscreen pages 3-4, fu2020woundingtriggersmiro1 pages 1-2)

4) Pathway context and interaction partners
- Core mitochondrial dynamics: Fusion (FZO-1 for OMM; EAT-3 for IMM) and fission (DRP-1 dynamin-related GTPase). Loss of fzo-1 causes chronic fragmentation; genetic interactions with drp-1 (loss of fission suppresses fusion defects in some contexts). URLs: Westermann 2010, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2009.12.003 (Aug 2010). (westermann2010mitochondrialdynamicsin pages 4-5)
- Mitophagy and UPRmt: fzo-1 mutants engage the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt); a genome-wide RNAi screen in fzo-1 mutants identified 299 suppressors and 86 enhancers of UPRmt (≈90% and ≈86% conserved in humans, respectively), implicating ER–mitochondria contact factors and IP3 signaling in modulating stress signaling. URL: Haeussler 2021, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab095 (Mar 2021). (haeussler2021genomewidernaiscreen pages 3-4)
- SLC25A46 (slc-25A46) acts upstream of FZO-1 to promote fusion: slc-25A46 mutants phenocopy fzo-1 with fragmented mitochondria; drp-1 loss or FZO-1 overexpression suppresses fragmentation; overexpression of FZO-1 mitigates slc-25A46 defects, indicating SLC-25A46 promotes fusion via FZO-1 and links OMM and IMM fusion machineries (Ugo1-like role). URL: Obinata et al., J Cell Sci, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.11.579862 (Feb 2024). (obinata2024slc25a46regulatesmitochondrial pages 1-5)
- MIRO-1 signaling and injury response: Acute epidermal wounding triggers MIRO-1– and Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation within ~50 ± 10 µm of the wound that develops over ~5–10 minutes and resolves by ~24 h; fzo-1 mutants exhibit constitutively elevated fragmentation that accelerates actin-based wound closure via mtROS and cytochrome P450, and this depends on MIRO-1. URL: Fu 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14885-x (Feb 2020). (fu2020woundingtriggersmiro1 pages 1-2)

5) Genetic and phenotypic evidence in C. elegans
- Mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure: Quantitative CRISPR null analysis (fzo-1(cjn020)) shows an 11% reduction in mitochondrial size vs. wild type; increased circularity consistent with fragmentation; EM revealed altered inner membrane/cristae structure, with 22% of fzo-1 mitochondria containing electron-dense inclusions (11/51 mitochondria examined), indicating FZO-1 impacts IMM architecture as well as OMM fusion. URL: Byrne et al., CMLS, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03024-5 (Mar 2019). (byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 2-5)
- Stress resistance and pathway activation: Loss of fzo-1 increases resistance to heat (37°C) and oxidative stress (e.g., 300 µM juglone; 4 mM paraquat) but increases sensitivity to osmotic stress (500 mM NaCl) and anoxia (0% O2, 48 h). fzo-1 and eat-3 mutants show activation of multiple stress pathways (mitoUPR/ATFS-1, SKN-1 oxidative, HSPs, hypoxia, DAF-16). URL: Machiela et al., FASEB J, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.201903235r (May 2020). (machiela2020disruptionofmitochondrial pages 9-11)
- Development and viability: Classical studies report slow growth, reduced brood size, and elevated embryonic lethality when FZO-1 is disrupted; DRP-1 is the conserved fission GTPase; CED-9 can interact with FZO-1/EAT-3 to promote fusion. URL: Westermann, Semin Cell Dev Biol, 2010, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2009.12.003 (Aug 2010). (westermann2010mitochondrialdynamicsin pages 4-5)

6) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- SLC25A46 positions upstream of FZO-1 to promote mitochondrial fusion and maintain neuronal morphology; genetic suppression by drp-1 loss and rescue by FZO-1 overexpression highlight pathway directionality. This directly links a human neuropathy gene to the FZO-1 fusion axis in vivo. URL: Obinata et al., J Cell Sci, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.11.579862 (Feb 2024). (obinata2024slc25a46regulatesmitochondrial pages 1-5)
- Systems-level modulation of UPRmt in fzo-1 mutants: the genome-wide screen delineated 385 genes that modify UPRmt in the fusion-defective background (299 suppressors; 86 enhancers), with enrichment for ER-mitochondria contacts and IP3 signaling, pointing to membrane contact-site homeostasis as a key modulator of FZO-1–linked mitochondrial stress. URL: Haeussler et al., G3, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab095 (Mar 2021). (haeussler2021genomewidernaiscreen pages 3-4)
- Tissue injury response and mitodynamics: Wounding induces MIRO-1–dependent fragmentation that, like the chronic fragmentation in fzo-1 mutants, accelerates tissue repair via mtROS/P450 signaling, revealing physiological contexts where reduced fusion biases can be adaptive. URL: Fu et al., Nat Commun, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14885-x (Feb 2020). (fu2020woundingtriggersmiro1 pages 1-2)

7) Expert opinions and analysis
- Conservation and core role: Reviews and syntheses emphasize that FZO-1 is the single mitofusin in C. elegans, with essential roles in mitochondrial fusion and organismal health; coordination with EAT-3/OPA1 is central, and DRP-1 balances fission. The C. elegans system provides clean genetics to disentangle outer vs inner membrane fusion roles. URLs: Westermann 2010, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2009.12.003 (Aug 2010); Köhler 2020, https://doi.org/10.5282/edoc.27226 (Jan 2020); Haeussler 2021, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab095 (Mar 2021). (westermann2010mitochondrialdynamicsin pages 4-5, kohler2020analysisofthe pages 13-16, haeussler2021genomewidernaiscreen pages 3-4)
- Mechanistic inference from mitofusin biochemistry: Structural and biochemical work in mammalian MFNs (e.g., GTPase-driven conformational switches, coiled-coil–mediated trans tethering) support a conserved mechanism that likely applies to FZO-1; these principles align with worm phenotypes where GTPase loss-of-function causes fragmentation and UPRmt activation. URL: Bocanegra 2025 review (mechanistic background context). (bocanegra2025theregulationof pages 68-71)

8) Relevant statistics and quantitative findings
- UPRmt modifier screen in fzo-1 background: 299 suppressors and 86 enhancers; ≈90% and ≈86% conserved in humans; modifiers enriched for ER–mitochondria contact and IP3 signaling pathways. URL: Haeussler 2021, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab095 (Mar 2021). (haeussler2021genomewidernaiscreen pages 3-4)
- Mitochondrial morphology metrics in fzo-1 nulls: 11% reduction in mitochondrial size vs WT; increased circularity; 22% with electron-dense inclusions (11/51) by EM; extensive sampling (n ≥ 2525 mitochondria quantified by light microscopy; dozens by EM). URL: Byrne 2019, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03024-5 (Mar 2019). (byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 2-5)
- Injury-induced mitodynamics: Fragmentation forms within ~5–10 min of wounding, extends ~50 ± 10 µm from wound edge, and resolves by ~24 h; fzo-1 mutant fragmentation and wound-closure acceleration depend on MIRO-1 and mtROS/P450 signaling. URL: Fu 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14885-x (Feb 2020). (fu2020woundingtriggersmiro1 pages 1-2)
- Stress responses: fzo-1 mutants show increased resistance to heat and oxidative stress (e.g., 300 µM juglone, 4 mM paraquat) but increased sensitivity to osmotic (500 mM NaCl) and anoxic stress (0% O2, 48 h), with upregulation of mitoUPR (ATFS-1), SKN-1, HSPs, hypoxia, and DAF-16 pathways. URL: Machiela 2020, https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.201903235r (May 2020). (machiela2020disruptionofmitochondrial pages 9-11)

9) Biological role synthesis and applications
- Primary role: FZO-1 catalyzes OMM fusion via GTP-dependent mitofusin mechanisms and operates in a conserved pathway with EAT-3 to complete mitochondrial fusion; loss of FZO-1 fragments mitochondria, disrupts inner-membrane/cristae organization, activates UPRmt, and alters organismal stress physiology and development. URLs: Haeussler 2021, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab095 (Mar 2021); Byrne 2019, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03024-5 (Mar 2019). (haeussler2021genomewidernaiscreen pages 3-4, byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 2-5)
- Pathway integration and disease relevance: C. elegans genetics place SLC-25A46 upstream of FZO-1 to promote fusion and maintain neuronal morphology, highlighting a conserved disease axis (SLC25A46–MFN–OPA1) relevant to human neuropathies. URLs: Obinata 2024, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.11.579862 (Feb 2024). (obinata2024slc25a46regulatesmitochondrial pages 1-5)
- Adaptive contexts: In epithelial injury, reduced fusion/greater fragmentation (as in fzo-1 mutants or acute MIRO-1–dependent response) can accelerate wound healing via mtROS signaling, illustrating context-dependent benefits of altered mitochondrial dynamics. URL: Fu 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14885-x (Feb 2020). (fu2020woundingtriggersmiro1 pages 1-2)
