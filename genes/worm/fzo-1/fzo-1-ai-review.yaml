description: FZO-1 is the sole C. elegans mitofusin ortholog, a transmembrane GTPase
  of the TRAFAC-class dynamin-like superfamily that localizes to the mitochondrial
  outer membrane and mediates outer membrane fusion. FZO-1 functions in a conserved
  pathway with EAT-3 (OPA1 ortholog) which mediates inner membrane fusion; both are
  required for complete mitochondrial fusion. The balance between fusion (FZO-1, EAT-3)
  and fission (DRP-1) determines mitochondrial morphology. Loss of fzo-1 causes constitutive
  mitochondrial fragmentation, disrupts cristae organization, activates the mitochondrial
  unfolded protein response (UPRmt), and alters stress physiology. FZO-1 interacts
  with the BCL-2 homolog CED-9, which can promote mitochondrial fusion by interacting
  with FZO-1. FZO-1 is dispensable for apoptosis activation but loss of fusion affects
  mitochondrial dynamics during development and stress responses.

  review:
    summary: FZO-1 is a transmembrane GTPase of the TRAFAC-class dynamin-like superfamily.
      UniProt assigns EC 3.6.5.- and specifies GTP hydrolysis activity catalyzing
      GTP + H2O = GDP + phosphate + H(+). The protein contains a conserved Dynamin-type
      G domain (residues 97-352) with characteristic G1-G5 motifs and GTP-binding
      regions. GTPase activity is essential for mitofusin-mediated membrane fusion,
      powering conformational changes needed for membrane tethering and fusion.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core molecular function of FZO-1. The dynamin-like GTPase activity is
      well-established for mitofusins across species, with conserved domain architecture
      including the P-loop NTPase domain. UniProt documents GTP binding sites and
      the catalytic reaction. IBA annotation is appropriately supported by phylogenetic
      inference from characterized orthologs including yeast Fzo1 (SGD:S000000383)
      and human MFN2 (UniProtKB:Q8IWA4).

  review:
    summary: FZO-1 mediates mitochondrial outer membrane fusion as the sole C. elegans
      mitofusin ortholog. Loss of fzo-1 causes constitutive mitochondrial fragmentation
      due to unopposed fission. FZO-1 works in coordination with EAT-3 (OPA1 ortholog)
      which mediates inner membrane fusion; both are required for complete mitochondrial
      fusion.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the core biological process function of FZO-1. The IBA annotation
      is well-supported by phylogenetic inference from characterized mitofusins. Multiple
      primary literature sources in C. elegans confirm this function directly, including

  review:
    summary: FZO-1 is an integral mitochondrial outer membrane protein with two transmembrane
      helices (residues 618-638 and 641-661). The N-terminal GTPase domain and C-terminal
      region are cytoplasmic, with a short intermembrane space segment. This localization
      is essential for its function in mediating outer membrane fusion.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Well-supported cellular component annotation. UniProt documents the transmembrane

  review:
    summary: Mitofusins including FZO-1 have been implicated in regulating mitochondrial
      distribution and localization through their role in fusion dynamics. However,
      the primary function of FZO-1 is membrane fusion itself, not the positioning
      or transport of mitochondria within cells.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While mitofusins can affect mitochondrial distribution as a consequence
      of fusion/fission balance, this is not a primary function of FZO-1. The core
      function is membrane fusion. Mitochondrion localization is more directly regulated
      by motor proteins and cytoskeletal interactions. The IBA annotation is based
      on phylogenetic inference, but for FZO-1 specifically, the primary evidence
      supports fusion rather than localization/transport. This annotation should be
      kept but marked as non-core since it may represent a secondary consequence of
      fusion activity rather than a primary function.

    reason: This is a high-level biological process term that accurately captures
      FZO-1's role. Mitochondrial fusion is a key aspect of mitochondrion organization,
      and fzo-1 mutants show clear defects in mitochondrial network organization.
      The IEA annotation from ARBA machine learning is consistent with experimental

  review:
    summary: This IMP annotation is based on Breckenridge et al. (2008) which studied

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the most direct experimental evidence for FZO-1's role in mitochondrial
      fusion in C. elegans. PMID:18722182 explicitly identifies fzo-1 as a profusion
      gene. The paper shows that "profusion genes fzo-1 and eat-3 or the profission

    profission by enhancing DRP-1 recruitment. The molecular details of how CED-9
    binding activates FZO-1 are not fully understood.
- question: Does FZO-1 directly interact with SLC-25A46, or does SLC-25A46 regulate
    fusion through indirect mechanisms? Recent work (Obinata 2024) shows SLC-25A46
    acts upstream of FZO-1 to promote fusion and FZO-1 overexpression can rescue slc-25a46
    defects. The nature of this functional relationship needs clarification.
