## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** G5ED37
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Intraflagellar transport protein 88 homolog {ECO:0000313|EMBL:CCD74417.1}; SubName: Full=OSM-5 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAK01173.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=osm-5 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:CCD74417.1, ECO:0000313|WormBase:Y41G9A.1}; ORFNames=CELE_Y41G9A.1 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:CCD74417.1}, Y41G9A.1 {ECO:0000313|WormBase:Y41G9A.1};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** TPR-like_helical_dom_sf. (IPR011990); TPR_rpt. (IPR019734); TPR_16 (PF13432); TPR_8 (PF13181)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "osm-5" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'osm-5' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **osm-5** (gene ID: osm-5, UniProt: G5ED37) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

*Table: Concise, cited summary of key facts about C. elegans osm-5 (IFT88): identity, role in IFT-B and ciliogenesis, localization, mutant phenotypes, interactors/regulators, recent applications, and available quantitative IFT measurements.*

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and orthology: osm-5 (locus Y41G9A.1) in Caenorhabditis elegans encodes the nematode ortholog of IFT88, a core subunit of the intraflagellar transport complex B (IFT-B). Genome-wide ciliary gene profiling explicitly annotates Y41G9A.1/osm-5 as IFT88 and highlights X-box promoter features associated with RFX/DAF-19 regulation of ciliary genes (Current Biology, 2005; DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.059) (blacque2005functionalgenomicsof pages 2-3).
- Molecular role in IFT: IFT88/OSM-5 is part of the salt-stable IFT-B core that mediates anterograde transport with kinesin-2 motors. Loss of IFT-B components, including IFT88, abolishes IFT and disrupts ciliogenesis (thesis/review synthesis of IFT-B core composition) (2014; URL not provided in source extract) (sanders2014…andfunctional pages 24-27). Functionally in C. elegans, DYF-2 (WDR19) is required for ciliary loading of OSM-5; in dyf-2 mutants, OSM-5::GFP fails to concentrate at the ciliary base and mislocalizes in dendrites (Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2006; DOI: 10.1091/mbc.E06-04-0260) (efimenko2006caenorhabditiselegansdyf2an pages 6-8).
- Cellular context: osm-5 functions in ciliated sensory neurons (amphid, phasmid, etc.), where defects cause canonical dye-filling (Dyf) and chemosensory phenotypes (Current Biology, 2005; DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.059) (blacque2005functionalgenomicsof pages 2-3).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Sensory-response dynamics: Acute inhibition of IFT in 2024 demonstrated that ciliary trafficking versus morphology differentially shapes sensory response dynamics within and between chemosensory neuron types in C. elegans, highlighting IFT’s role in receptor localization, desensitization, and adaptation. This study provides modern protocols for dye-filling, chemotaxis, and osmotic avoidance used to interrogate cilia-dependent behaviors (PLOS Biology, Nov 2024; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3002892; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002892) (philbrook2024ciliastructureand pages 18-19).
- Longevity signaling: A 2024 PNAS study shows that ciliary defects reduce cyclic nucleotide-gated channel activity in sensory neurons, activating intestinal UPRER and extending lifespan. Notably, osm-5 mutants were reported with shorter cilia in the context of the longevity phenotype, linking IFT88/OSM-5 function to organismal aging pathways (PNAS, Jun 2024; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2321228121; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2321228121) (shanmugam2018ciliumlengthand pages 10-13).
- IFT and compound uptake: Though pre-2023, 2021 work demonstrated that amphid cilia and IFT are required for ivermectin/moxidectin uptake, connecting IFT machinery (including OSM-5 context) with pharmacological access routes to sensory cilia (bioRxiv, Oct 2021; DOI: 10.1101/2021.10.22.465401; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.22.465401) (brinzer2021theuptakeof pages 37-39).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Neurosensory modulation: Acute IFT perturbation is being used to dissect how trafficking controls receptor spatial organization and olfactory response dynamics, providing a framework to parse IFT-dependent versus structure-dependent contributions to behavior (PLOS Biology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002892) (philbrook2024ciliastructureand pages 18-19).
- Geroscience/chemical screening: Pharmacological inhibition of ciliary channels recapitulating cilia-defect signaling to extend lifespan positions ciliary proteins and IFT-dependent receptor trafficking as targets for longevity-promoting interventions (PNAS, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2321228121) (shanmugam2018ciliumlengthand pages 10-13).
- Anthelmintic uptake/resistance: Imaging of fluorescent avermectin analogs shows IFT-dependent entry through sensory cilia, suggesting that perturbations in IFT (including osm-5 contexts) can influence drug susceptibility—relevant for parasitic nematode control strategies (bioRxiv, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.22.465401) (brinzer2021theuptakeof pages 37-39).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- The 2005 Curr Biol functional genomics study provides authoritative classification of osm-5 as IFT88 and as a DAF-19/X-box–regulated ciliary gene, foundational to cilia gene annotation in C. elegans (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.059) (blacque2005functionalgenomicsof pages 2-3).
- The 2006 MBoC DYF-2 study provides mechanistic evidence for IFT-B coupling and the requirement of DYF-2 for OSM-5 ciliary loading, aligning with anterograde IFT-B function (https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e06-04-0260) (efimenko2006caenorhabditiselegansdyf2an pages 6-8).
- The 2016 PLoS Genetics work on age-dependent ciliary recovery in IFT hypomorphs offers the perspective that proteostasis and chaperones can partially restore IFT function and behavior in adults, a nuanced view of IFT deficiency outcomes (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006325) (cornils2016structuralandfunctional pages 13-14).
- The 2018 MCB study links kinase pathways, tubulin acetylation, and IFT motor dynamics, contextualizing how signaling and microtubule PTMs modulate IFT behavior where osm-5 operates (https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.00612-17) (shanmugam2018ciliumlengthand pages 10-13).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- IFT-B transport dynamics: DYF-2::GFP (IFT-B-associated) anterograde velocities measured in C. elegans sensory cilia were approximately 1.09 ± 0.13 µm/s in the middle segment and 1.33 ± 0.12 µm/s in the distal segment; OSM-5 transport behavior resembles other IFT-B components based on cotransport observations (MBoC, 2006; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e06-04-0260) (efimenko2006caenorhabditiselegansdyf2an pages 6-8). Additional cotransport comparisons including OSM-5 and OSM-6 are discussed in more recent preprints, though measured effects on OSM-5 rates were minimal in CFH-1 mutants (bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.10.681644) (oshima2025complementfactorh pages 1-5).
- Aging-dependent recovery in IFT mutants: Hypomorphic IFT mutants show age-dependent cilia structural/functional recovery around day 4 of adulthood at 20°C, with partial restoration of sensory behaviors; this recovery requires IFT and HSF-1/Hsp90 chaperone activity (PLoS Genetics, 2016; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006325) (cornils2016structuralandfunctional pages 13-14).
- Kinase/PTM regulation of IFT: In pkg-1 and gck-2 signaling contexts, IFT motor localization and velocities shift with tubulin acetylation changes; rapamycin phenocopies gck-2 effects, linking mTOR to IFT dynamics and cilia length (MCB, 2018; https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.00612-17) (shanmugam2018ciliumlengthand pages 10-13).

Detailed functional annotation of osm-5 (IFT88)
- Primary molecular function and subcomplex: OSM-5 is a core IFT-B subunit that participates in anterograde IFT with kinesin-2, contributing to the assembly and maintenance of cilia by transporting axonemal and membrane proteins along the ciliary microtubules. IFT-B core stoichiometry includes IFT88 alongside IFT25/27/70/46/52/22/74/81, forming a salt-stable assembly crucial for IFT train formation (2014 synthesis) (sanders2014…andfunctional pages 24-27). In vivo, DYF-2 (WDR19) is necessary for OSM-5 ciliary loading; loss of dyf-2 disrupts OSM-5 localization at the ciliary base, consistent with a role for WDR19 in IFT-B assembly/cargo coupling (MBoC, 2006; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e06-04-0260) (efimenko2006caenorhabditiselegansdyf2an pages 6-8).
- Subcellular localization and dynamics: OSM-5::GFP localizes to the ciliary base and axoneme and moves with IFT-B trains. In dyf-2 mutants, failure to enrich at the base and dendritic mislocalization are observed, indicating base-loading dependency. DYF-2::GFP anterograde velocities of ~1.1 µm/s (middle) and ~1.3 µm/s (distal) reflect IFT-B train kinetics, with OSM-5 showing similar transport characteristics (MBoC, 2006; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e06-04-0260) (efimenko2006caenorhabditiselegansdyf2an pages 6-8, oshima2025complementfactorh pages 1-5).
- Requirement for ciliogenesis and maintenance: IFT-B integrity is essential for cilium assembly; functional impairment leads to truncated or absent cilia. In hypomorphic IFT mutants, adult-onset, temporary restoration of cilia structure/function occurs via proteostasis-dependent mechanisms, requiring HSF-1/Hsp90 and ongoing IFT (PLoS Genetics, 2016; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006325; 2014 IFT-B synthesis) (cornils2016structuralandfunctional pages 13-14, sanders2014…andfunctional pages 24-27).
- Mutant phenotypes and assays: Classical osm-5 mutants are dye-filling defective (Dyf) and have chemosensory and osmotic avoidance defects characteristic of ciliary dysfunction. Dye-filling uses lipophilic dyes (e.g., DiI) to label amphid/phasmid neurons via open ciliary pores; chemotaxis and osmotic-avoidance behaviors quantify sensory function. Modern protocols (e.g., DiI 0.1 mg/ml; plate chemotaxis; 8 M glycerol barrier) provide standardized measurements (Curr Biol, 2005; PLOS Biology, 2024; DOIs above) (blacque2005functionalgenomicsof pages 2-3, philbrook2024ciliastructureand pages 18-19).
- Pathway interactions and regulators: DYF-2 (WDR19) interacts functionally with OSM-5 for base loading (MBoC, 2006) (efimenko2006caenorhabditiselegansdyf2an pages 6-8). BBSome is implicated in IFT train assembly and cargo handling in the same ciliary context (IFT-B synthesis) (sanders2014…andfunctional pages 24-27). Kinase and PTM pathways (PKG-1, GCK-2, mTOR/rapamycin, acetylated tubulin) modulate IFT motor dynamics and cilia length, providing regulatory axes where osm-5-expressing neurons are affected (MCB, 2018) (shanmugam2018ciliumlengthand pages 10-13). Adult chaperone networks (HSF-1/Hsp90) support recovery of IFT function and cilia structure in hypomorphic backgrounds (PLoS Genetics, 2016) (cornils2016structuralandfunctional pages 13-14).

Verification checklist (mandated)
1. Gene symbol matches protein description: osm-5 is annotated as IFT88/OSM-5 in C. elegans ciliary gene cataloging (Curr Biol, 2005) (blacque2005functionalgenomicsof pages 2-3).
2. Organism correct: C. elegans throughout the cited studies (blacque2005functionalgenomicsof pages 2-3, efimenko2006caenorhabditiselegansdyf2an pages 6-8, cornils2016structuralandfunctional pages 13-14, philbrook2024ciliastructureand pages 18-19).
3. Protein family/domains: IFT88 family membership and IFT-B core role are supported. While the provided UniProt annotation indicates TPR-like repeats, domain-level confirmation was not directly captured in the retrieved texts; however, the IFT88 identity and IFT-B role are strongly supported (blacque2005functionalgenomicsof pages 2-3, sanders2014…andfunctional pages 24-27).
4. Ambiguity check: No evidence of a different “osm-5” gene in another organism was used; all sources are specific to C. elegans IFT88/OSM-5.

Limitations and open points
- Exact domain architecture (TPR repeat mapping) of OSM-5 in C. elegans was not explicitly detailed in the extracted passages; inference is made from UniProt and conserved IFT88 family properties. Targeted structural references would further substantiate this.
- Many quantitative datasets report IFT velocities for closely coupled IFT-B proteins (e.g., DYF-2) rather than OSM-5 directly; nevertheless, these capture IFT-B transport kinetics in which OSM-5 participates (efimenko2006caenorhabditiselegansdyf2an pages 6-8).

Conclusion
C. elegans osm-5 encodes IFT88, a core IFT-B component essential for anterograde transport, ciliogenesis, and ciliary maintenance in sensory neurons. OSM-5 localizes to the ciliary base and axoneme and requires DYF-2 for proper ciliary loading. Classical osm-5 mutants display hallmark ciliary phenotypes (Dyf, chemosensory and osmotic-avoidance defects). Recent work underscores how IFT—thus OSM-5 function—modulates sensory response dynamics, interfaces with longevity signaling, and determines uptake of small molecules via sensory cilia. Regulatory inputs from kinase signaling, microtubule PTMs, and proteostasis components fine-tune IFT behavior and can transiently restore function in hypomorphic contexts (blacque2005functionalgenomicsof pages 2-3, efimenko2006caenorhabditiselegansdyf2an pages 6-8, cornils2016structuralandfunctional pages 13-14, philbrook2024ciliastructureand pages 18-19, shanmugam2018ciliumlengthand pages 10-13, brinzer2021theuptakeof pages 37-39).
