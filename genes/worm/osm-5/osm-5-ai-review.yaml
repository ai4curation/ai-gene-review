description: 'OSM-5 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian IFT88/Polaris, a core
  component of the intraflagellar transport particle B (IFT-B) complex. The protein
  contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that mediate protein-protein
  interactions within the IFT machinery. OSM-5 is essential for the assembly and maintenance
  of sensory cilia in C. elegans neurons. It localizes to the ciliary base and axoneme,
  where it undergoes bidirectional IFT movement. Loss of osm-5 function results in
  severely shortened ciliary axonemes with normal transition zones, leading to dye-filling
  defects and impaired chemosensation. The gene is expressed exclusively in ciliated
  sensory neurons under control of the RFX-type transcription factor DAF-19. osm-5
  mutants display osmotic avoidance defects, chemotaxis impairments, and altered dauer
  formation, all consequences of defective sensory cilia. The conservation of OSM-5/IFT88
  function from worms to humans has made C. elegans an important model for understanding
  ciliopathies including polycystic kidney disease.
