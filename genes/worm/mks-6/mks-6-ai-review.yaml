description: MKS-6 is the C. elegans ortholog of human CC2D2A (coiled-coil and C2
  domain-containing protein 2A), a component of the MKS (Meckel-Gruber syndrome) module
  at the ciliary transition zone. The protein contains a C2 domain (aa 680-800) and
  localizes specifically to the transition zone (TZ), where it functions together
  with other MKS/MKSR proteins (MKS-1, MKSR-1, MKSR-2, MKS-3, MKS-5) and NPHP proteins
  (NPHP-1, NPHP-4) to establish basal body/TZ membrane associations and the ciliary
  gate during ciliogenesis. MKS-6 exhibits functional redundancy with NPHP-4, as double
  mutants show severe ciliogenesis defects not seen in single mutants. MKS-6 also
  localizes to the dendrite terminus in AFD thermosensory neurons, where transition
  zone proteins unexpectedly function in establishing a membrane diffusion barrier.
  Mutations in the human ortholog CC2D2A cause Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) and Joubert
  syndrome (JBTS).

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: MKS-6 localization to the ciliary transition zone is well-established
      through phylogenetic inference from the PANTHER family. The human ortholog CC2D2A
      and mouse ortholog Cc2d2a are both validated TZ components. This annotation
      is consistent with direct experimental evidence in C. elegans from PMID:21422230
      and PMID:26595381.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation is fully consistent with multiple lines of experimental
      evidence demonstrating that MKS-6 localizes to the transition zone. The annotation
      represents a core localization of this protein that is central to its function.

    label: protein localization to ciliary transition zone
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: MKS-6 is part of a module of proteins that collectively recruit each
      other to the transition zone. The IBA annotation is supported by experimental
      evidence showing that MKS-5 is required for docking/anchoring MKS-6 and other
      MKS module proteins at the TZ.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation reflects MKS-6's role in the hierarchical assembly of
      the MKS module at the transition zone. The protein participates in mutual localization
      dependencies with other TZ proteins.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: MKS-6 is required for non-motile cilium assembly in C. elegans, particularly
      evident in genetic interaction studies. Single mks-6 mutants have mild phenotypes,
      but combined with nphp-4 mutations show severe ciliogenesis defects.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation accurately reflects MKS-6's role in ciliogenesis. C.
      elegans possesses only non-motile (primary) cilia in sensory neurons, and MKS-6
      is essential for their assembly through its function at the transition zone.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This IDA annotation provides direct experimental evidence for MKS-6 TZ

    action: ACCEPT

  review:
    summary: The ND annotation indicates no specific molecular function has been experimentally
      determined for MKS-6. The C2 domain suggests potential lipid or calcium binding,
      but this has not been directly demonstrated for MKS-6.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation correctly reflects that no specific enzymatic or molecular
      function has been experimentally characterized for MKS-6. The protein functions
      as a structural component of the MKS module at the transition zone, but the
      precise molecular mechanism remains undefined.

  review:
    summary: Nguyen et al. demonstrated that transition zone proteins, including those
      in the MKS module, unexpectedly localize to the dendrite terminus in AFD thermosensory
      neurons, where they establish a membrane diffusion barrier despite the absence
      of canonical TZ ultrastructure.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This localization represents a specialized function of MKS module proteins
      in AFD neurons. While not a canonical TZ, the dendrite terminus compartment
      requires TZ proteins for proper compartmentalization of signaling components.
