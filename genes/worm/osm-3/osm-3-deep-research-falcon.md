## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P46873
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Osmotic avoidance abnormal protein 3; AltName: Full=Kinesin-like protein osm-3;
- **Gene Information:** Name=osm-3 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:M02B7.3b}; ORFNames=M02B7.3 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:M02B7.3b};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the TRAFAC class myosin-kinesin ATPase

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "osm-3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'osm-3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **osm-3** (gene ID: osm-3, UniProt: P46873) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification
We verified the target gene/protein identity before research: OSM-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans is a homodimeric kinesin-2 family motor that powers anterograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) in sensory cilia, cooperating with heterotrimeric kinesin-II; this matches UniProt P46873 and its kinesin/P-loop NTPase domains (kinesin motor domain, P-loop NTPase) (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200606003) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2). Segmental roles and velocities reported in amphid/phasmid cilia further support correct identity (Unknown journal, 2009) (inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33).

Comprehensive research report: C. elegans osm-3 (UniProt: P46873)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Definition and family: OSM-3 is a kinesin-2 family motor that forms a homodimer and hydrolyzes ATP via its P-loop NTPase motor domain to move toward microtubule plus ends. In C. elegans ciliated sensory neurons, OSM-3 functions as an anterograde IFT motor; heterotrimeric kinesin-II is the other anterograde IFT motor, and both motors can transport the same IFT particles in vivo (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200606003) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2). Reviews and summaries of C. elegans IFT likewise identify OSM-3 as the homodimeric kinesin-2 ortholog of vertebrate KIF17 (Unknown journal, 2012) (broekhuis2012ciliarylengthcontrol pages 103-110).
- Localization and ciliary segmentation: Amphid and phasmid cilia are organized into a proximal transition zone, a middle segment built on doublet microtubules, and a distal segment built on singlet microtubules. OSM-3 and kinesin-II cooperate in the middle segment, while OSM-3 alone extends and traffics within the distal singlet segment (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200606003) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2). Segment-specific transport has been quantified using fluorescent IFT reporters in live animals (Unknown journal, 2009) (inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 91-96).
- Core pathway: IFT comprises IFT-A and IFT-B subcomplexes, BBSome adaptors, anterograde kinesins (kinesin-II, OSM-3), and retrograde dynein-2. BBS proteins help hold IFT-A and IFT-B trains together and coordinate motor action with OSM-3/kinesin-II (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200606003) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Handling of hyperactive OSM-3 by neurons and glia (EMBO J, May 2024): A constitutively active OSM-3 (OSM-3CA; hinge/stalk mutation G444E) is excluded from cilia in vivo, released via membrane abscission from neurite tips, and engulfed by neighboring glia in a CED-1–dependent manner. Intragenic suppressors in the OSM-3 motor domain and genetic inhibition of the ciliary kinase DYF-5 restore ciliary localization/structure in OSM-3CA animals. Findings support a model of intramolecular autoinhibition relieved by cargo/regulators at the ciliary base and reveal neuron–glia cooperation to dispose of hyperactive kinesins (EMBO J; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00118-0) (xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 1-2, xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 12-13, xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 29-30).
- Segmental import and regulation revealed by rigor/hyperactive mutants (EMBO J, May 2024): A rigor OSM-3G235A binds microtubules but does not undergo IFT and is restricted to the middle segment; when kinesin-II is impaired (klp-11 null), the rigor mutant fails to enter cilia, indicating kinesin-II–dependent import/localization of specific OSM-3 states. DYF-5 kinase modulates OSM-3 activity and distal-segment formation, consistent with earlier suggestions that MAP kinase signaling affects kinesin-II/OSM-3 coordination (EMBO J; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00118-0) (xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 12-13, xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 1-2).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Genetic and live-imaging dissection of IFT: OSM-3 fluorescent knock-ins and engineered mutants (e.g., G444E hyperactive; G235A rigor) are used to quantify motility, segmental distribution, and regulatory dependencies, enabling rigorous assessment of motor coordination, IFT train composition, and quality-control pathways in vivo. Suppressor screens using dye-filling (DiI) identify modifiers of motor hyperactivity and provide candidate regulatory mechanisms linking motor conformational state to ciliary entry and glial clearance (EMBO J, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00118-0) (xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 29-30, xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 1-2).
- Model for human ciliopathies and KIF17 function: Because OSM-3 is the C. elegans counterpart of KIF17, OSM-3-based assays are used to study how BBSome/IFT modules coordinate with motors, how segmental architecture emerges from motor specialization, and how dysregulation alters ciliary signaling—principles applicable to human cilia biology (Mol Biol Cell, 2007) (ou2007sensoryciliogenesisin pages 14-15).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Motor cooperation model: In vitro gliding assays and in vivo imaging support mechanical competition/coordination between kinesin-II (slow) and OSM-3 (fast) on the same IFT particles, with BBS proteins contributing to tension and train integrity. Quantitative modeling and genetic separations (bbs mutants) support this view (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200606003) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2).
- Modular regulation of OSM-3 docking and activation: Genetic analyses place DYF-1 and DYF-13 as OSM-3 modulators that promote docking/activation on IFT trains and distal-segment assembly, while emphasizing that cargo modules can exhibit dynamics distinct from core IFT particles; disruptions may impair function without overtly altering IFT motility (May 2007, Mol Biol Cell; URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e06-09-0805) (ou2007sensoryciliogenesisin pages 14-15).
- Segment-specific redundancy and specialization: Kinesin-II and OSM-3 are redundant in the middle segment but OSM-3 is uniquely required for distal singlet microtubule extension; double mutants lacking both motors abrogate cilium formation, establishing the division of labor across ciliary segments (Unknown journal, 2009; Sep 2006, J Cell Biol) (inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33, pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent and classic studies
- Ciliary architecture and segmental lengths (amphid): transition zone ~1 μm, middle/doublets ~4 μm, distal/singlets ~2.5 μm (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200606003) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2).
- Anterograde transport velocities: kinesin-II alone ~0.5 μm/s; OSM-3 alone ~1.2–1.3 μm/s; combined in middle segment ~0.7–0.74 μm/s; distal IFT speeds ~1.15–1.21 μm/s in vivo (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; Unknown journal, 2009; Unknown journal, 2012) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2, inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 91-96, broekhuis2012ciliarylengthcontrol pages 103-110).
- Segmental roles and mutant phenotypes: osm-3 mutants lack distal segments and exhibit dye-filling (Dyf) defects and impaired osmotic avoidance/chemosensory behaviors; osm-3; kinesin-II double mutants fail to build cilia (Unknown journal, 2009; Sep 2006, J Cell Biol) (inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33, pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2).
- BBS-dependent train separation and speeds: in bbs-7/-8 mutants, kinesin-II/IFT-A move at ~0.5 μm/s and OSM-3/IFT-B at ~1.3 μm/s, indicating BBSome roles in coupling IFT-A/B and coordinating motor action (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200606003) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2).
- 2024 suppressor screen and quantitative assays: Dye-filling screen size N≈≥100 animals per genotype; microtubule gliding velocities for OSM-3 suppressor mutants quantified via Gaussian fits (e.g., ~0.98 ± 0.17 μm/s, ~1.12 ± 0.11 μm/s), and SEC-MALS/LC-MS used to assess biochemical states (May 2024, EMBO J; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00118-0) (xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 29-30).

Mechanism, substrates/cargo, and regulation
- Biochemical activity: As a kinesin motor, OSM-3 catalyzes ATP hydrolysis to step along axonemal microtubules, transporting IFT complexes and cargo anterogradely toward ciliary tips (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200606003) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2).
- Cargo and association: OSM-3 is tightly coupled to IFT-B complexes and, through BBS proteins, to IFT-A, enabling unified IFT trains; in bbs mutants, the complexes and motors segregate into distinct trains with distinct speeds (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200606003) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2). Regulatory adaptors DYF-1 and DYF-13 promote OSM-3 docking/activation and distal segment assembly; other cargo modules can affect function without overtly changing core IFT motility (May 2007, Mol Biol Cell; URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e06-09-0805) (ou2007sensoryciliogenesisin pages 14-15).
- Regulation and signaling: Evidence supports intramolecular autoinhibition of OSM-3 relieved at the ciliary base; DYF-5 (a MAPK) modulates motor activity and the division of labor with kinesin-II, and hyperactive OSM-3 triggers a neuron–glia disposal program via CED-1–dependent engulfment (May 2024, EMBO J; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00118-0) (xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 1-2, xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 12-13). Segmental transport rates and coupling with kinesin-II reflect mechanical coordination that can be tuned by IFT train composition and BBSome-dependent tension (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200606003) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2).

Cellular/organismal phenotypes and localization
- Localization: OSM-3 localizes to cilia of amphid and phasmid neurons and exhibits segment-specific transport behavior—cooperative in the middle segment and OSM-3-only in the distal segment (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; Unknown journal, 2009) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2, inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 91-96).
- Phenotypes: osm-3 loss leads to distal segment defects and Dyf phenotypes, correlating with impaired osmotic avoidance and other sensory behaviors; removal of both OSM-3 and kinesin-II eliminates cilia (Unknown journal, 2009; Sep 2006, J Cell Biol) (inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33, pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2).

Conclusions
OSM-3 (UniProt P46873) is the homodimeric kinesin-2 motor that drives anterograde IFT in C. elegans sensory cilia. It cooperates with kinesin-II in middle segments and acts alone in distal segments to extend singlet microtubules. Transport velocities, segmental specialization, and BBSome-dependent coupling of IFT-A/B define its mechanistic role. Recent (2024) work reveals neuron–glia quality control that clears hyperactive OSM-3 and identifies DYF-5 and intragenic changes as key regulators of OSM-3 conformation, ciliary entry, and distal-segment formation. These insights consolidate OSM-3 as a central, regulated driver of ciliary assembly and signaling, and as a model for conserved KIF17 function in metazoan cilia (Sep 2006, J Cell Biol; May 2007, Mol Biol Cell; Unknown journal, 2009; May 2024, EMBO J) (pan2006mechanismoftransport pages 1-2, ou2007sensoryciliogenesisin pages 14-15, inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33, xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 12-13, xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 1-2, xie2024neuronsdisposeof pages 29-30).
