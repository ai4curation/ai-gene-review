description: OSM-3 is a homodimeric kinesin-2 family motor protein essential for intraflagellar
  transport (IFT) in C. elegans sensory cilia. It functions cooperatively with heterotrimeric
  kinesin-II to drive anterograde IFT in the middle segment of cilia, and is the sole
  motor for IFT in the distal segment where it builds the distal singlet microtubule
  region. OSM-3 is autoinhibited in a folded conformation and is activated upon binding
  to IFT particles. It is expressed exclusively in 26 chemosensory neurons (amphid,
  inner labial, and phasmid neurons). OSM-3 mutants have truncated cilia lacking distal
  segments and show defects in osmotic avoidance, chemotaxis, and dauer formation.

  evidence_type: IGI
  original_reference_id: PMID:11381260
  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on genetic interactions affecting DAF-16 regulation
      and lifespan. The study shows sensory neurons affect DAF-16 localization and
      aging, but OSM-3's role is indirect through ciliary function (PMID:11381260).
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: The connection to insulin signaling is indirect. OSM-3 mutations cause
      ciliary defects that affect sensory neuron function. Sensory neurons in turn
      regulate insulin signaling. OSM-3 does not directly regulate insulin receptor
      signaling; it enables proper ciliary function in sensory neurons.

    label: plus-end-directed microtubule motor activity
  description: OSM-3 is a homodimeric kinesin-2 motor that moves processively toward
    microtubule plus-ends at approximately 1.3 um/s in vivo. It cooperates with heterotrimeric
    kinesin-II in the middle segment (doublet MTs) and functions alone in the distal
    segment (singlet MTs) of sensory cilia.

    label: ATP hydrolysis activity
  description: OSM-3 hydrolyzes ATP to power its motor activity with a basal rate
    of approximately 4 ATP/s/head that increases dramatically (to approximately 70-75
    ATP/s/head) when autoinhibition is relieved by cargo binding or hinge mutations.
    This autoinhibitory mechanism is essential for proper OSM-3 function in vivo.
suggested_questions:
- question: What is the structural basis for OSM-3 autoinhibition and how does cargo
    binding relieve it? The G444E mutation in the hinge region activates OSM-3, suggesting
    specific conformational regulation that could be elucidated structurally.
- question: How is OSM-3 specifically recruited to IFT particles and what role does
    phosphorylation at S316 play? The S316F mutation has NPHP-4 dependent effects,
    suggesting complex regulation of OSM-3 recruitment to IFT machinery.
