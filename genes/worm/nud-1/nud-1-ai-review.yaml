description: >-
  C. elegans NUD-1 (Nuclear migration protein nudC) is an evolutionarily conserved
  member of the NudC family that functions in nuclear migration, mitotic progression,
  and cytoskeletal dynamics. NUD-1 associates with microtubules and the dynein motor
  complex, working alongside LIS-1 to ensure proper cell division and nuclear positioning
  (PMID:11685578). The protein contains a conserved p23/HSP20-like domain (CS domain)
  and an N-terminal NudC domain. In vitro studies demonstrate that NUD-1 exhibits
  ATP-independent molecular chaperone (holdase) activity, preventing aggregation of
  citrate synthase and luciferase at stoichiometric concentrations, and protecting
  native enzyme activity from thermal inactivation (PMID:18626791). Importantly,
  NUD-1/substrate complexes are productive -- unfolded intermediates can be refolded
  by ATP-dependent chaperones, indicating NUD-1 acts as a holdase that maintains
  substrates in a refolding-competent state (PMID:18626791). NUD-1 is expressed in
  sensory neurons, embryos, gonad, gut, vulva, ventral cord, and hypodermal seam
  cells (PMID:11685578). RNAi knockdown causes embryonic lethality, sterility,
  altered vulval morphology, uncoordinated movement, and nuclear positioning defects
  in early embryonic cell division (PMID:11685578). Depletion of NUD-1 also leads to
  defective GABA synaptic vesicle trafficking and increased susceptibility to
  pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions (PMID:16996038).

      IBA annotation for involvement in protein folding, inferred phylogenetically.
      NUD-1 has been demonstrated to exhibit chaperone activity in vitro
      (PMID:18626791), preventing aggregation of citrate synthase and luciferase.
      However, NUD-1 functions as a holdase rather than a foldase -- it prevents
      aggregation of unfolded substrates, which can then be refolded by ATP-dependent
      chaperones. The IBA annotation is consistent with the experimental evidence
      from PMID:18626791.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Protein folding is appropriate as a biological process annotation for a holdase
      chaperone, as NUD-1 maintains unfolded intermediates in a refolding-competent
      state that can be subsequently refolded by the cellular chaperone machinery
      (PMID:18626791). The IBA inference is supported by direct experimental evidence.

      denaturing citrate synthase and luciferase (PMID:18626791), functioning as

      it is a NudC family protein with an HSP20-like fold (CS domain) whose primary

      IEA annotation for synaptic localization, inferred automatically from

      inter-ontology logical inference. NUD-1 depletion causes defective GABA
      synaptic vesicle trafficking (PMID:16996038), which supports a role at
      synapses. However, this is an indirect inference -- NUD-1 may affect
      synaptic vesicle trafficking through its role in cytoskeletal dynamics
      (dynein/microtubule-dependent transport) rather than being a resident
      synaptic protein.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

      The inference from GABAergic synaptic transmission to synaptic localization
      is logically valid. NUD-1 depletion disrupts GABA synaptic vesicle
      trafficking (PMID:16996038), suggesting functional involvement at synapses.
      However, NUD-1 is primarily a cytoplasmic, microtubule-associated protein
      and its synaptic role is secondary to its core function in nuclear migration
      and chaperone activity.

    description: >-
      NUD-1 functions as an ATP-independent holdase chaperone that prevents
      aggregation of denaturing proteins and maintains substrates in a
      refolding-competent state (PMID:18626791). This chaperone activity,
      mediated by its conserved p23/HSP20-like CS domain, likely supports
      its essential role in nuclear migration and mitotic progression by
      maintaining the integrity of key protein complexes (dynein, LIS-1)
      required for cell division. NUD-1 is required for proper pronuclear
      migration and embryo development (PMID:11685578).
