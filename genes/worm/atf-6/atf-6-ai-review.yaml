description: ATF-6 is an ER membrane-bound bZIP transcription factor that 
  functions as one of the three canonical branches of the endoplasmic reticulum 
  unfolded protein response (UPRER) in C. elegans. Under ER stress, ATF-6 
  dissociates from BiP, traffics to the Golgi, undergoes regulated intramembrane
  proteolysis (S1P/S2P cleavage), and the released N-terminal fragment 
  translocates to the nucleus where it activates transcription of ER 
  proteostasis genes. ATF-6 cooperates with the IRE-1/XBP-1 branch and is 
  synthetically lethal with ire-1/xbp-1 or pek-1 deletion, causing L2 larval 
  arrest. Beyond classical UPR functions, ATF-6 regulates ER calcium homeostasis
  through calreticulin (crt-1) expression, influencing ER-mitochondrial calcium 
  signaling and lifespan. ATF-6 loss extends lifespan by approximately 43-57% 
  through altered ER-mitochondrial calcium flux.

    review:
      summary: ATF-6 is a well-established component of the ER UPR in C. 
        elegans. ATF-6 functions as one of three canonical branches of the UPRER
        alongside IRE-1/XBP-1 and PEK-1 (PMID:16184190, 
        file:worm/atf-6/atf-6-deep-research-falcon.md). Upon ER stress, ATF-6 
        activates transcription of genes involved in the UPR, particularly 
        constitutive UPR (c-UPR) genes important during development.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This IBA annotation is well-supported by direct experimental 
        evidence. Shen et al. (2005) demonstrated that atf-6 is required for 
        expression of many c-UPR genes, and acts synergistically with pek-1 to 
        complement the developmental requirement for ire-1 and xbp-1 
        (PMID:16184190). Multiple subsequent studies confirm ATF-6's role in UPR
        signaling.

    review:
      summary: ATF-6 localizes to the nucleus after activation. Upon ER stress, 
        ATF-6 is cleaved to release an N-terminal bZIP transcription factor that
        translocates to the nucleus to activate target gene transcription 
        (UniProt Q20435, file:worm/atf-6/atf-6-deep-research-falcon.md).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: As a bZIP transcription factor, ATF-6 must localize to the nucleus
        to carry out its transcriptional regulatory function. The cleaved 
        N-terminal fragment (ATF-6n) contains the bZIP DNA-binding domain and 
        translocates to the nucleus. This is consistent with mammalian ATF6 
        function and supported by phylogenetic inference.

      summary: Burkewitz et al. (2020) showed that atf-6 loss reprograms ER 
        calcium handling by downregulating calreticulin/crt-1, enhancing 
        ER-to-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer 
        (file:worm/atf-6/atf-6-deep-research-falcon.md). This is noted in 
        UniProt annotations.
      action: NEW
      reason: This annotation captures an important aspect of ATF-6 function 
        beyond classical UPR. The study provides direct evidence that ATF-6 
        regulates ER calcium homeostasis through calreticulin expression.

core_functions:
  - description: ATF-6 is a bZIP transcription factor with a conserved 
      DNA-binding domain (aa 250-299). Upon ER stress and proteolytic 
      activation, ATF-6 translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription 
      of UPR target genes. This is the primary molecular function of ATF-6 
      (PMID:16184190, UniProt Q20435).

  - description: ATF-6 functions as one of three canonical branches of the UPRER
      in C. elegans. It is essential for expression of constitutive UPR genes 
      and acts synergistically with pek-1 to complement ire-1/xbp-1. Loss of 
      atf-6 combined with ire-1 or xbp-1 deletion causes L2 larval arrest 
      (PMID:16184190, PMID:31570707).

      expression, altering ER calcium buffering capacity and ER-mitochondrial 
      calcium transfer. This function underlies ATF-6's role in lifespan 
      regulation (PMID:32905769).

suggested_questions:
  - question: What are the direct transcriptional targets of ATF-6 in C. 
      elegans? While microarray studies identified genes regulated by atf-6, 
      direct ChIP-seq or CUT&RUN analysis would clarify which genes are directly
      bound by ATF-6 versus indirectly regulated.
  - question: How does ATF-6 cooperate with XBP-1s at the molecular level? 
      Studies show ATF-6 is required for XBP-1s-mediated protection in tauopathy
      models, but the mechanism of cooperation (heterodimerization, co-binding) 
      is unclear in worms.
suggested_experiments:
  - description: ChIP-seq analysis of ATF-6 binding sites. Direct identification
      of ATF-6 genomic binding sites would clarify direct versus indirect target
      genes and reveal the DNA sequences recognized by C. elegans ATF-6.
    hypothesis: ATF-6 directly binds to ERSE elements in target gene promoters
  - description: Tissue-specific rescue experiments to determine in which 
      tissues ATF-6 acts to regulate lifespan. This would clarify whether the 
      longevity phenotype is mediated through intestine, neurons, or other 
      tissues.
    hypothesis: ATF-6 functions primarily in intestinal cells to regulate 
      lifespan
