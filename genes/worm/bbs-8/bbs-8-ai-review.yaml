description: BBS-8 is the C. elegans ortholog of human TTC8 (tetratricopeptide repeat
  protein 8), a core component of the BBSome complex. The BBSome is essential for
  intraflagellar transport (IFT) assembly and regulation. BBS-8 contains multiple
  TPR repeats that mediate protein-protein interactions within the complex. BBS-8
  is required for proper BBSome assembly at the ciliary base, IFT particle integrity
  during transport, and IFT turnaround at the ciliary tip. Loss of BBS-8 results in
  dissociation of IFT-A and IFT-B subcomplexes during anterograde transport, leading
  to cilia structural defects and compromised sensory functions including chemotaxis,
  thermotaxis, and olfactory learning. BBS-8 localizes to the ciliary base, moves
  along the ciliary axoneme with IFT particles, and is enriched in ring-like structures
  at the base of specialized sensory compartments.

  review:
    summary: BBS-8 is a well-established core component of the BBSome complex. This
      annotation is supported by extensive phylogenetic evidence and direct experimental
      data showing that BBS-8 associates with other BBSome subunits (BBS-1, BBS-2,
      BBS-4, BBS-5, BBS-7, BBS-9) to form a functional complex (PMID:22922713). UniProt
      also confirms BBS-8 is "Part of BBSome complex, that contains at least bbs-1,
      bbs-2, bbs-4, bbs-5, osm-12, bbs-8/ttc-8 and bbs-9."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core function. BBSome membership is the most fundamental aspect of BBS-8
      function. The BBSome controls IFT assembly and turnaround, and BBS-8 is essential
      for complex integrity. IBA annotation is strongly supported by experimental
      evidence from multiple C. elegans studies.

    summary: BBS-8 localizes predominantly at the ciliary basal body/base region,

  review:
    summary: BBS-8 functions as a structural adaptor within the BBSome complex, mediating
      protein-protein interactions through its TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) domains.
      The BBSome acts as a cargo adaptor complex for IFT, and BBS-8 is essential for
      holding IFT-A and IFT-B subcomplexes together during transport (PMID:22922713).
      The TPR repeat architecture is a well-characterized protein-protein interaction
      scaffold. UniProt describes the BBSome as functioning as a "coat complex required
      for sorting of specific membrane proteins to the primary cilia."
    action: NEW
    reason: This molecular function annotation is proposed based on the structural
      role of BBS-8 within the BBSome. The protein contains 7-8 TPR repeats (UniProt),
      which are canonical protein-protein interaction domains. The BBSome functions
      as an adaptor/scaffold complex that organizes IFT particles and recruits cargo.
      BBS-8 is essential for maintaining IFT-A/IFT-B association. The ND annotation
      for molecular function should be replaced with this more informative term.

      supporting_text: Combined with our findings that the BBSome controls IFT assembly
        at both ciliary base and tip, it is highly likely that the BBSome functions
        as a scaffold to organize IFT-A, IFT-B, ciliary membrane receptors, ciliary
        signaling molecules, and/or other IFT cargos into an entire unit and prepare
        it for IFT transport.
    - reference_id: PMID:22922713
      supporting_text: The BBSome also shares the common structural features with
        COPI, COPII, and clathrin coats, and can directly recognize IFT cargos
