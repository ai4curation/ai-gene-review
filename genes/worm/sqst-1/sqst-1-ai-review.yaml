description: SQST-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian p62/SQSTM1 and functions
  as a selective autophagy receptor. It contains conserved functional domains including
  a C-terminal UBA (ubiquitin-associated) domain that binds ubiquitinated cargo, an
  LIR (LC3-interacting region) motif for binding LGG-1/LGG-2 (Atg8/LC3 family proteins),
  a PB1 domain for self-oligomerization required for cargo clustering, and a ZZ-type
  zinc finger domain. SQST-1 bridges ubiquitinated protein aggregates to autophagosomes
  for degradation via aggrephagy, playing critical roles in proteostasis maintenance.
  SQST-1 accumulation (as puncta or protein levels) serves as a widely used readout
  for autophagic flux - accumulation indicates reduced flux, while decreased SQST-1
  indicates increased flux.

    label: aggrephagy
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Aggrephagy is a core function of SQST-1. The protein is required for
      degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates via selective autophagy. SQST-1
      binds ubiquitinated cargo via its UBA domain and recruits autophagosomes via
      LGG-1 interaction.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the primary biological process function of SQST-1. The deep research
      clearly establishes that SQST-1 binds ubiquitinated protein aggregates and delivers
      them to autophagosomes via LGG-1 interactions. The IBA inference from mammalian
      p62 is fully supported by direct experimental evidence in C. elegans.

        (PB1) promotes phase separation/condensates and cargo clustering, facilitating
        autophagosome formation and turnover of aggregates (aggrephagy)

    label: mitophagy
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: While mammalian p62/SQSTM1 has been implicated in mitophagy, direct experimental
      evidence for SQST-1 in C. elegans mitophagy is limited. The deep research notes
      that direct worm evidence for SQST-1's role in mitophagy remains less defined
      than aggrephagy.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The IBA inference is phylogenetically sound given p62's role in mammalian
      mitophagy, but the primary worm literature emphasizes aggrephagy rather than
      mitophagy for SQST-1. Reviews infer conserved roles in organelle quality control
      based on domain conservation, but worm-specific mitophagy by SQST-1 has not
      been directly demonstrated. This is a plausible secondary function inferred
      from orthology rather than a demonstrated core function in C. elegans.

  review:
    summary: Mammalian p62 interacts with atypical PKC isoforms via its PB1 domain.
      While SQST-1 contains a conserved PB1 domain that mediates self-oligomerization,
      direct evidence for PKC binding in C. elegans has not been reported in the literature
      reviewed.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: The IBA inference is based on mammalian p62 PKC interactions. SQST-1 has
      a PB1 domain and presumably retains similar binding capabilities, but no C.
      elegans-specific experimental evidence was found. The PB1 domain in worm literature
      is discussed primarily in the context of self-oligomerization for cargo clustering
      rather than PKC signaling. Without worm-specific data, this remains uncertain.

  review:
    summary: Mammalian p62 has been implicated in endosomal trafficking, but this
      is not a well-documented function for C. elegans SQST-1. The primary literature
      on SQST-1 focuses on its role in autophagy and proteostasis rather than endosome
      organization.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The IBA inference is phylogenetically sound but not supported by direct
      C. elegans evidence in the literature reviewed. SQST-1 is primarily studied
      in the context of autophagy in worms. This may be a peripheral function inferred
      from mammalian ortholog studies.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Amphisomes are intermediate compartments formed by fusion of autophagosomes
      with endosomes before final lysosomal fusion. SQST-1 is documented to localize
      to autophagic structures that colocalize with LGG-1 puncta.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Given SQST-1's role as an autophagy cargo receptor that bridges cargo
      to LGG-1-labeled autophagic structures, localization to amphisomes (intermediate
      autophagy compartments) is consistent with its function. The IBA inference aligns
      with experimental observations of SQST-1 colocalization with LGG-1 puncta in
      C. elegans.

  review:
    summary: SQST-1 contains a conserved UBA domain (residues 654-693) that binds
      ubiquitin. The protein functions by binding ubiquitinated cargo for delivery
      to autophagosomes. Mammalian p62 shows preference for K63-linked ubiquitin chains.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This molecular function is central to SQST-1's role as a selective autophagy
      receptor. The UBA domain is clearly documented in the UniProt record and functionally
      important for cargo recognition. While the specific K63-linkage preference has
      not been directly tested in C. elegans, the IBA inference from mammalian p62
      is strongly supported by conservation of the UBA domain and the functional requirement
      for ubiquitin binding in aggrephagy.

    summary: SQST-1 is observed to form puncta/aggregates, particularly in autophagy
      mutants or under proteotoxic stress. These SQST-1-positive structures accumulate
      when autophagic flux is impaired and represent sites of cargo accumulation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SQST-1 puncta formation is extensively documented in C. elegans literature
      as a readout for autophagic flux. The protein accumulates into visible aggregates
      when autophagy is blocked, consistent with aggresome localization. This is experimentally
      validated in worm studies showing SQST-1::GFP puncta accumulation in autophagy

      by anti-EPG-7 antibody from embryonic extracts.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While the protein binding is experimentally demonstrated, this term is
      too general and uninformative. The specific interactions with EPG-7 (a scaffold
      protein) and LGG-1/Atg8 (via LIR motif) should be captured with more specific
      terms. The core molecular function of SQST-1 as an autophagy cargo adaptor is
