## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9XW70
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=BBSome complex member bbs-7 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=Bardet-Biedl syndrome 7 protein homolog {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8IWZ6}; AltName: Full=Osmotic avoidance abnormal protein 12 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y75B8A.12};
- **Gene Information:** Name=osm-12 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y75B8A.12}; Synonyms=bbs-7 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y75B8A.12}; ORFNames=Y75B8A.12 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y75B8A.12};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Bardet-Biedl_syndrome_7_prot. (IPR016575); BBS7_GAE_dom. (IPR056334); BBS7_hairpin. (IPR056335); BBS7_pf_dom. (IPR056333); Beta-prop_BBS7. (IPR056332)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "osm-12" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'osm-12' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **osm-12** (gene ID: bbs-7, UniProt: Q9XW70) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification
We verified the target identity and nomenclature. osm-12 in Caenorhabditis elegans encodes the BBS-7 subunit of the BBSome complex; the classic osm-12(n1606) allele corresponds to bbs-7. BBS proteins (including BBS-7/OSM-12) are expressed in ciliated sensory neurons and localize to the ciliary transition zone and axoneme with bidirectional, IFT-like motility (Blacque et al., Genes & Development, 2004, published July 2004, https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.1194004) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 4-5, blacque2004lossofc. pages 1-2).

*Table: Concise, sourced summary of experimental evidence for C. elegans osm-12 (bbs-7): identity, localization, canonical and non-canonical roles, phenotypes, regulatory mechanisms and recent (2023) advances; useful as a quick reference linking claims to primary sources.*

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
• BBSome and OSM-12/BBS-7 identity: The BBSome is an octameric coat adaptor complex for ciliary membrane protein trafficking. In C. elegans, osm-12 encodes the BBS-7 ortholog and is a core BBSome subunit. BBS proteins localize at the ciliary base/transition zone and along axonemes and undergo IFT-like bidirectional movement, indicating coupling to intraflagellar transport (IFT). Genetic mapping and rescue established osm-12 as bbs-7 (Blacque et al., 2004, Genes & Development, https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.1194004) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 4-5, blacque2004lossofc. pages 1-2).
• Canonical role in ciliary trafficking: The BBSome functions as a cargo adapter that recognizes short sequence motifs on ciliary GPCRs and other membrane proteins, enabling their removal/export from cilia and passage through the transition zone; it interacts with ubiquitin and supports ubiquitin-dependent sorting of certain ciliary cargos. In C. elegans, mislocalization/accumulation of PKD-2, OSM-9, and ODR-10 occurs in bbs mutants. Mechanistically, activated GPCRs are earmarked by ubiquitin chains for BBSome-mediated removal, and BBSome “trains” mediate receptor exit via the transition zone (Wingfield et al., Essays in Biochemistry, Oct 2018, https://doi.org/10.1042/ebc20180030; Zhou et al., Mol Biol Cell, Nov 2022, https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e22-05-0161) (wingfield2018traffickingofciliary pages 4-5, zhou2022cep19–rabl2–iftbaxiscontrols pages 14-14).
• Localization and IFT coupling: In worms, BBS-7/OSM-12 localizes to cilia and is required to maintain proper IFT component localization and motility (OSM-5/Polaris, CHE-11; lesser effect on CHE-2), consistent with a selective role in IFT assembly/function (Blacque et al., 2004, Genes & Development, https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.1194004) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 1-2).
• Subciliary compartmentalization: BBS and IFT genes help maintain distinct ciliary membrane subdomains; loss of BBS/IFT perturbs the restriction of ARL-13/ARL13B to its proximal compartment and promotes inappropriate accumulation at periciliary membranes, indicating roles in defining diffusion barriers and active transport into compartments (Cevik et al., PLoS Genetics, Dec 2013, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003977; Wingfield et al., 2018) (wingfield2018traffickingofciliary pages 4-5).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
• Ubiquitylation-dependent regulation of the BBSome (2023): The E3 ligase PJA2 resides in cilia and ubiquitylates BBSome subunits upon GPCR–cAMP stimulation. Ubiquitylation of BBS1 at K143 stabilizes the BBSome and enhances BBS1–BBS3/ARL6 interaction; blocking this ubiquitylation (BBS1 K143R) disrupts GPCR trafficking, Shh transcriptional responses, ciliogenesis, and photoreceptor morphogenesis in vivo (medaka), highlighting conserved ubiquitin-dependent control of BBSome stability and function (Chiuso et al., EMBO Reports, Feb 2023, https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202255571) (chiuso2023ubiquitylationofbbsome pages 1-2).
• IFT–BBSome interface for GPCR export (2022→relevant to 2023–2024 understanding): A CEP19–RABL2–IFT-B axis controls BBSome-mediated GPCR export; GTP-locked RABL2 phenocopies IFT27 loss, with BBSome and LZTFL1 accumulation in cilia and blocked export of GPCRs (GPR161, Smoothened), reinforcing a regulated recruitment/reassembly paradigm at the ciliary base and tip (Zhou et al., Mol Biol Cell, Nov 2022, https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e22-05-0161) (zhou2022cep19–rabl2–iftbaxiscontrols pages 14-14).
• C. elegans drug-uptake/resistance landscape (2024): A G3 study catalogued 24 novel anthelmintic survival-associated genes and underscored the centrality of IFT/ciliary components for macrocyclic lactone (ivermectin, moxidectin) resistance; amphid cilia defects alter drug uptake and downstream signaling. While not focused on osm-12 specifically, it situates BBSome/IFT pathways as key determinants of anthelmintic responses in nematodes (Brinzer et al., G3, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkae009) (zhou2022cep19–rabl2–iftbaxiscontrols pages 14-14).
• Cilia-independent BBSome roles refined: In C. elegans, the BBSome (including osm-12/bbs-7) controls stability of the non-ciliary photoreceptor LITE-1 and acts via DLK–MAPK and endocytic pathways, revealing BBSome functions outside ciliary trafficking that still impact sensory modalities (Zhang et al., Developmental Cell, Jun 2022, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2022.05.005) (zhang2022aciliaindependentfunction pages 1-3).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
• Ciliopathy modeling and GPCR trafficking paradigms: C. elegans osm-12/bbs-7 mutants model Bardet–Biedl syndrome mechanisms of ciliary trafficking and enable visualization of IFT/BBSome motility, receptor mislocalization, and compartmentalization defects, informing human GPCR trafficking rules and ubiquitin-guided removal from cilia (Blacque et al., 2004, https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.1194004; Wingfield et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1042/ebc20180030; Zhou et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e22-05-0161) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 4-5, wingfield2018traffickingofciliary pages 4-5, zhou2022cep19–rabl2–iftbaxiscontrols pages 14-14).
• Endocrine/obesity-relevant pathways: BBSome mutants exhibit hypersecretion of dense-core vesicles from ciliated neurons. Suppressing this hypersecretion alone can normalize body size, feeding, and metabolic phenotypes despite persistent ciliary structural defects, delineating BBSome-regulated neuroendocrine axes as potential therapeutic entry points (Lee et al., PLoS Biology, Dec 2011, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001219) (lee2011hyperactiveneuroendocrinesecretion pages 2-4, lee2011hyperactiveneuroendocrinesecretion pages 1-2).
• Anthelmintic resistance biology: The cilia/IFT machinery is a determinant of macrocyclic lactone uptake and resistance; this informs surveillance and mechanism-guided strategies to counteract drug resistance in parasitic nematodes (Brinzer et al., G3, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkae009) (zhou2022cep19–rabl2–iftbaxiscontrols pages 14-14).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
• BBSome as a ciliary coat adaptor: Reviews and mechanistic studies support a model in which the BBSome, recruited by ARL6/ARL3 and coordinated with IFT, recognizes short cytosolic motifs on GPCRs and exports activated receptors across the transition zone; ubiquitin marks on GPCRs guide this retrieval, and BBSome itself is subject to ubiquitin-based regulation (Wingfield et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1042/ebc20180030; Zhou et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e22-05-0161; Chiuso et al., 2023, https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202255571) (wingfield2018traffickingofciliary pages 4-5, zhou2022cep19–rabl2–iftbaxiscontrols pages 14-14, chiuso2023ubiquitylationofbbsome pages 1-2).
• C. elegans-specific insights: Foundational work shows BBS-7/OSM-12 is required for normal IFT protein motility/localization, ciliary morphology, and sensory behaviors; in addition, non-ciliary roles (DLK–MAPK/LITE-1 stability; neuroendocrine secretion restraint) are now recognized as critical for organismal phenotypes (Blacque et al., 2004, https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.1194004; Lee et al., 2011, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001219; Zhang et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2022.05.005) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 4-5, lee2011hyperactiveneuroendocrinesecretion pages 2-4, zhang2022aciliaindependentfunction pages 1-3).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
• Cilia morphology: ASER cilia lengths are reduced in osm-12/bbs-7 mutants compared to wild type (WT 5.94 ± 0.67 μm; osm-12 mutants 4.51 ± 1.24 μm and 3.38 ± 0.91 μm; n = 50 per condition), and truncated cilia often exhibit fragmented distal fluorescence; transition zones remain grossly normal (Blacque et al., 2004, Genes & Development, https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.1194004) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 4-5).
• Neuroendocrine secretion: BBSome mutants (including bbs-7/osm-12) show approximately 2–3-fold increased release/accumulation of dense-core vesicle cargoes (insulin reporters; DAF-7, FLP-21), whereas IFT mutants show ~50% reductions in insulin secretion. Normalizing secretion restores body size/feeding/metabolic phenotypes without correcting ciliary structure (Lee et al., 2011, PLoS Biology, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001219) (lee2011hyperactiveneuroendocrinesecretion pages 2-4, lee2011hyperactiveneuroendocrinesecretion pages 1-2).
• Post-translational regulation: In vertebrate systems, BBS1 K143 ubiquitylation by PJA2 increases BBSome stability and binding to ARL6; preventing ubiquitylation disrupts GPCR trafficking and ciliogenesis and impairs photoreceptor morphogenesis (Chiuso et al., 2023, EMBO Reports, https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202255571) (chiuso2023ubiquitylationofbbsome pages 1-2).
• GPCR trafficking rules: Activated GPCRs in cilia are tagged by ubiquitin chains for BBSome-mediated removal; BBSome trains enable passage through the transition zone—providing a mechanistic basis for receptor export (Zhou et al., 2022, Mol Biol Cell, https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e22-05-0161) (zhou2022cep19–rabl2–iftbaxiscontrols pages 14-14).

Functional annotation for osm-12 (bbs-7; UniProt Q9XW70)
• Molecular role: Non-enzymatic scaffolding/adaptor component of the BBSome; facilitates ciliary membrane protein trafficking, especially export/retrieval of GPCRs and other cargos, by coupling to IFT and recognizing cargo sequence/ubiquitin signals; contributes to assembly/stability of IFT particle interactions and to subciliary compartmentalization at the ciliary base/transition zone (Blacque et al., 2004; Wingfield et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2022) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 4-5, wingfield2018traffickingofciliary pages 4-5, zhou2022cep19–rabl2–iftbaxiscontrols pages 14-14).
• Cellular localization: Enriched at the ciliary transition zone and along the axoneme of ciliated sensory neurons; moves bidirectionally with IFT (Blacque et al., 2004, https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.1194004) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 1-2).
• Pathways: Ciliary trafficking/IFT; GPCR export via BBSome; ubiquitin-dependent cargo sorting; DLK–MAPK signaling in cilium-independent neuronal functions; neuroendocrine secretion regulation from ciliated neurons (Blacque et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2011; Wingfield et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2022) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 4-5, lee2011hyperactiveneuroendocrinesecretion pages 2-4, wingfield2018traffickingofciliary pages 4-5, zhang2022aciliaindependentfunction pages 1-3).
• Organismal phenotypes: Dye-filling and chemotaxis defects; shortened/fragmented cilia; altered body size and fat content; feeding abnormalities due to hyperactive dense-core vesicle secretion; moderate sensory deficits; with additional emerging links to drug uptake/resistance via cilia/IFT pathways (Blacque et al., 2004, https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.1194004; Lee et al., 2011, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001219; Brinzer et al., 2024, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkae009) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 4-5, lee2011hyperactiveneuroendocrinesecretion pages 2-4, zhou2022cep19–rabl2–iftbaxiscontrols pages 14-14).

Notes on gene symbol ambiguity
The symbol osm-12 in C. elegans unambiguously maps to bbs-7 (BBS7) and aligns with the BBS7 family/domain architecture. No conflicting usage was identified in other organisms for this exact symbol within this context. All claims above are tied to C. elegans or conserved BBSome mechanisms, with worm-specific evidence when discussing osm-12 (Blacque et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2022) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 4-5, lee2011hyperactiveneuroendocrinesecretion pages 2-4, zhang2022aciliaindependentfunction pages 1-3).
