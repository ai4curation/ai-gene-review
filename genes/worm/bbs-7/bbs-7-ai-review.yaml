description: BBS-7 (also known as OSM-12) is a core component of the BBSome complex
  in C. elegans, required for proper intraflagellar transport (IFT) particle assembly
  and IFT turnaround at the ciliary tip. The BBSome functions as a scaffold to organize
  IFT-A and IFT-B subcomplexes, ensuring their coordinated movement along ciliary
  axonemes. BBS-7 is expressed exclusively in ciliated sensory neurons and localizes
  to the cilium, ciliary basal body, and axoneme where it undergoes bidirectional
  IFT movement. Loss of BBS-7 function results in dissociation of IFT-A and IFT-B
  subcomplexes during anterograde transport, ciliary structural defects, compromised
  chemotaxis, and impaired localization of ciliary membrane proteins including guanylyl
  cyclases and mechanosensory receptors.

    label: intracellular protein localization
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: BBS-7 as part of the BBSome is involved in protein localization, specifically
      the targeting and transport of ciliary membrane proteins. The BBSome controls
      IFT assembly and turnaround, regulating protein cargo loading and transport
      (PMID:22922713).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While the annotation captures BBS-7's role in protein localization, this
      term is too general. The more specific function is ciliary protein localization,
      as BBS-7/BBSome specifically regulates the localization of proteins to and within
      cilia, including IFT components and ciliary membrane receptors (PMID:22922713,
      PMID:25335890).

  review:
    summary: BBS-7 as part of the BBSome is associated with membranes, particularly
      ciliary membranes. The BBSome shares structural features with COPI, COPII, and
      clathrin coats, functioning as a coat complex for membrane protein sorting (PMID:22922713).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term 'membrane' is too general for BBS-7 localization. BBS-7 specifically
      localizes to the ciliary membrane system and is involved in ciliary membrane
      protein sorting. A more specific cellular component term reflecting ciliary
      localization would be more appropriate.

    summary: BBS-7 is a core component of the BBSome complex. This is well-established

  findings:
  - statement: BBSome assembles IFT complexes at the ciliary base and tip
    supporting_text: the BBSome is required for assembling IFT particles at both ciliary
      base and tip
  - statement: BBS-1, BBS-7, and BBS-9 exist in the same complex (BiFC confirmation)

  - statement: BBSome functions as scaffold for IFT-A, IFT-B, and IFT cargos
    supporting_text: the BBSome functions as a scaffold to organize IFT-A, IFT-B,
      ciliary membrane receptors, ciliary signaling molecules, and/or other IFT cargos
      into an entire unit and prepare it for IFT transport

  description: BBS-7 is a core structural component of the BBSome complex that is
    essential for proper intraflagellar transport. The BBSome assembles IFT particles
    at the ciliary base and tip, maintaining IFT-A and IFT-B subcomplex integrity
    during transport. Loss of BBS-7 causes IFT-A and IFT-B subcomplexes to dissociate
    and move at different rates.
