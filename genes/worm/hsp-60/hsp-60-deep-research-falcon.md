2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'hsp-60' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **hsp-60** (gene ID: hsp-60, UniProt: P50140) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Caenorhabditis elegans hsp-60 (UniProt P50140)

Identity verification and overview
- Correct target: hsp-60 encodes the mitochondrial chaperonin HSP-60 (Cpn60) in C. elegans, a Group I chaperonin homologous to bacterial GroEL. It resides predominantly in the mitochondrial matrix and is a canonical component of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) transcriptional program in worms (and in mammals) (haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 5-6, kim2024regulationofproteostasis pages 1-2).
- Family/domains: HSP-60/Cpn60 exhibits the conserved GroEL-like equatorial (ATP-binding), intermediate, and apical (substrate/HSP10-binding) domains and forms oligomeric rings typical of the Cpn60 family (fink1999chaperonemediatedproteinfolding. pages 6-7, minari2024newinsightsinto pages 3-4, singh2024molecularchaperoninhsp60 pages 2-4).

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Chaperonin Cpn60/HSP-60 architecture and cycle: Cpn60 assembles into two stacked heptameric rings (tetradecamer) forming a central folding chamber. The co‑chaperonin HSP-10 (Cpn10/GroES) is a heptameric “lid” that binds the apical domains to cap the chamber. ATP binding/hydrolysis in the equatorial domains drives conformational transitions that capture non‑native polypeptides, encapsulate them beneath HSP‑10, and release folded clients; this mechanism is deeply conserved from GroEL/GroES (bacteria) to mitochondrial HSP-60/HSP-10 (eukaryotes) (Minari 2024 BioChem; Singh 2024 IJMS; Fink 1999 Physiol Rev) (minari2024newinsightsinto pages 3-4, singh2024molecularchaperoninhsp60 pages 1-2, fink1999chaperonemediatedproteinfolding. pages 6-7, singh2024heatshockresponse pages 13-15, fink1999chaperonemediatedproteinfolding. pages 5-6).
- Mitochondrial localization and import concept: HSP‑60 is nuclear‑encoded, synthesized in the cytosol, and imported into mitochondria (matrix) via an N‑terminal targeting presequence, where it folds imported matrix proteins and refolds stress‑damaged proteins, acting with HSP‑10 (singh2024molecularchaperoninhsp60 pages 1-2, kunachowicz2024heatshockproteins pages 10-11).
- UPRmt definition in C. elegans: The UPRmt is a mitochondria‑to‑nucleus stress program that upregulates mitochondrial chaperones (including hsp-60 and hsp-6) and proteostasis genes when matrix proteostasis, import, or translation are perturbed. In worms, the bZIP transcription factor ATFS‑1 integrates mitochondrial import efficiency to control UPRmt target gene expression; HAF‑1 (matrix peptide exporter) and DVE‑1 are additional regulators in specific contexts (Haynes & Hekimi 2022 Genetics; Kim et al. 2024 J Cell Biol) (haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 5-6, kim2024regulationofproteostasis pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Broad ATFS‑1 transcriptional scope and immunity link: A 2024 synthesis emphasizes that ATFS‑1 controls hundreds of genes spanning proteostasis, mitochondrial biogenesis, ROS detoxication, and innate immunity, underscoring UPRmt’s roles beyond classical chaperones (Kim et al., 2024-02-26; J Cell Biol; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202310005) (kim2024regulationofproteostasis pages 1-2).
- New upstream trigger—mitochondrial SAM deficiency: In 2024, mitochondrial S‑adenosylmethionine depletion (via sams-1 or SAM carrier knockdown) activated UPRmt and extended lifespan in C. elegans, acting through ATFS‑1/DVE‑1 and implicating a mitochondrial tRNA methyltransferase downstream; results support impaired mitochondrial translation as a trigger for UPRmt (Chen et al., 2024-02-18; Aging Cell; https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.14103) (jeong2017mitochondrialchaperonehsp‐60 pages 11-12).
- Consolidated understanding on aging: A 2022 field-defining review concluded that while UPRmt impacts many aspects of mitochondrial function, activation alone is not sufficient for lifespan extension in all contexts and can be deleterious when chronic—refining interpretations of UPRmt reporters in aging studies (Haynes & Hekimi, 2022-11-30; Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyac160) (haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 5-6).

3) Primary function and cellular localization of HSP-60 (mechanistic detail)
- Function: HSP‑60 is a mitochondrial matrix foldase that binds non‑native polypeptides via its apical hydrophobic surfaces and, together with the heptameric co‑chaperonin HSP‑10, encapsulates substrates in an ATP‑regulated chamber for productive folding; it also refolds stress‑damaged matrix proteins (Fink 1999; Minari 2024; Singh 2024) (fink1999chaperonemediatedproteinfolding. pages 6-7, minari2024newinsightsinto pages 3-4, singh2024molecularchaperoninhsp60 pages 1-2, kunachowicz2024heatshockproteins pages 10-11).
- Localization: Predominantly mitochondrial; in C. elegans, HSP‑60::GFP overexpression localizes primarily to mitochondria, though Jeong et al. detected a cytosolic pool that can modulate innate immunity signaling (Jeong 2017 EMBO J; https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201694781) (jeong2017mitochondrialchaperonehsp‐60 pages 12-13).

4) Pathways and regulatory context in C. elegans
- UPRmt reporters and regulation: hsp‑60 promoter fusions (hsp‑60p::GFP) are canonical UPRmt reporters. atfs‑1 is essential for induction of hsp‑60/hsp‑6; HAF‑1 and DVE‑1 contribute to induction in specific contexts (e.g., intestine in environmental stress), but HAF‑1 is not universally required across all mitochondrial perturbations (Haeussler & Conradt 2022; Bennett 2014; Liu 2019) (haeussler2022methodstostudy pages 16-18, bennett2014activationofthe pages 6-6, liu2019mitochondrialunfoldedprotein pages 1-2).
- Induction triggers and signaling inputs: UPRmt (and hsp‑60 reporters) can be induced by dissipating Δψm (FCCP), ROS stress (paraquat), mtDNA/translation insults (ethidium bromide; ETC RNAi), and environmental stress such as simulated microgravity. Mechanistically, Δψm impairment reduces ATFS‑1 mitochondrial import/degradation, enabling nuclear activation (Berry 2021; Runkel 2013; Rauthan & Pilon 2015; Liu 2019) (berry2021decreasedmitochondrialmembrane pages 1-3, runkel2013surveillanceactivateddefensesblock pages 1-2, rauthan2015achemicalscreen pages 1-3, liu2019mitochondrialunfoldedprotein pages 1-2).
- Immunity pathway role: Beyond folding, hsp‑60 contributes to antibacterial immunity via the p38 MAPK cascade. hsp‑60 RNAi in C. elegans reduces PMK‑1 (p38) activation reporters and phospho‑PMK‑1, decreasing resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14). A cytosolic HSP‑60 fraction stabilizes SEK‑1 in intestinal cells, acting downstream of or in parallel with TIR‑1 (Jeong 2017 EMBO J; Kwon et al. 2018) (jeong2017mitochondrialchaperonehsp‐60 pages 3-5, jeong2017mitochondrialchaperonehsp‐60 pages 12-13, kwon2018mitochondriamediateddefensemechanisms pages 2-3).

5) Phenotypes and quantitative data
- UPRmt dependence and reporter magnitudes: atfs‑1 deletion or RNAi largely abolishes induction of the hsp‑6p::gfp reporter and endogenous hsp‑6/hsp‑60 upon multiple mitochondrial perturbations, whereas some inductions are HAF‑1‑independent; one example reported approximately 15‑fold hsp‑6p::gfp induction despite haf‑1 loss (Bennett 2014; 2014-03-25; Nat Commun; https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms4483) (bennett2014activationofthe pages 6-6).
- Δψm perturbation: FCCP dose-dependently decreased Δψm and induced hsp‑60::GFP at an intermediate dose (as assayed after 24 h), with paraquat as positive control; experiments used TMRE staining and one‑way ANOVA statistics (Berry 2021; 2021-09-14; microPublication Biology; https://doi.org/10.17912/micropub.biology.000445) (berry2021decreasedmitochondrialmembrane pages 1-3).
- Environmental microgravity stress: Simulated microgravity significantly activated UPRmt using HSP‑6/60 markers; RNAi of hsp‑6 or hsp‑60 increased intestinal ROS and locomotion defects under microgravity; HAF‑1 and DVE‑1 were required in this intestinal signaling axis (Liu 2019; 2019-11-21; Sci Rep; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-53004-9) (liu2019mitochondrialunfoldedprotein pages 1-2).
- Immunity phenotypes: hsp‑60 RNAi lowers PMK‑1 activity (decreased PMK‑1 reporters and phospho‑PMK‑1) and reduces survival on PA14; cytosolic HSP‑60 overexpression improves PA14 resistance, consistent with HSP‑60 acting via p38/PMK‑1 (Jeong 2017; 2017-04-13; EMBO J; https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201694781) (jeong2017mitochondrialchaperonehsp‐60 pages 3-5, jeong2017mitochondrialchaperonehsp‐60 pages 12-13).
- Aging linkage: Constitutive activation of ATFS‑1 fails to extend lifespan and can reduce lifespan, indicating UPRmt activation alone does not guarantee longevity; correlations between reporter induction (including hsp‑60/hsp‑6) and lifespan outcomes are context‑dependent (Bennett 2014; Haynes & Hekimi 2022) (bennett2014activationofthe pages 6-6, haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 5-6).

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Reporter strains and assays: hsp‑60p::gfp and hsp‑6p::gfp transgenics are widely used for UPRmt monitoring in worms, enabling genetic screens, chemical screens, and physiological assays (Haeussler & Conradt 2022; Bar‑Ziv et al. 2020 JoVE; Rauthan & Pilon 2015) (haeussler2022methodstostudy pages 16-18, rauthan2015achemicalscreen pages 1-3).
- Chemical activators and screening: Paraquat and ethidium bromide are established UPRmt activators; tetracycline‑class hits (e.g., methacycline HCl) from small‑molecule screens induce hsp‑60::GFP in an ATFS‑1‑dependent manner. Ethidium bromide also activated UPRmt in mouse skeletal muscle, indicating cross‑species relevance (Rauthan & Pilon 2015; 2015-10-14; Worm; https://doi.org/10.1080/21624054.2015.1096490) (rauthan2015achemicalscreen pages 1-3).
- Protocols and toolkits: Methods collections document use of pathway‑specific GFP reporters (hsp‑60p::gfp/hsp‑6p::gfp), complementary stress assays, and genetic perturbations (e.g., RNAi) to dissect UPRmt and related pathways in C. elegans (Bar‑Ziv et al., 2020-05-15; JoVE; https://doi.org/10.3791/61001; Haeussler & Conradt, 2022-01; Methods Mol Biol) (haeussler2022methodstostudy pages 16-18).

7) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Genetics review (2022) and J Cell Biol review (2024) converge on ATFS‑1 as the pivotal integrator of mitochondrial import status with nuclear transcription, positioning hsp‑60/hsp‑6 upregulation as part of a broader mitochondrial stress recovery and immunity program; however, UPRmt activation is not a universal surrogate for beneficial longevity (Haynes & Hekimi 2022; Kim et al. 2024) (haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 5-6, kim2024regulationofproteostasis pages 1-2).
- EMBO Journal study (2017) adds a nuanced, potentially non‑canonical role for a cytosolic HSP‑60 fraction in stabilizing SEK‑1 and promoting PMK‑1 signaling during antibacterial defense, broadening the functional annotation of HSP‑60 beyond the mitochondrial matrix (Jeong 2017) (jeong2017mitochondrialchaperonehsp‐60 pages 12-13, jeong2017mitochondrialchaperonehsp‐60 pages 3-5).

| UPRmt marker / reporters | hsp-60 promoter has been used to build hsp-60p::GFP transcriptional reporters that are canonical readouts of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and respond to classic UPRmt perturbations. ATFS‑1 is essential for induction of hsp‑60 (and hsp‑6); some induction modalities show HAF‑1/DVE‑1 involvement. | Transcriptional reporters (hsp-60p::GFP, hsp-6p::GFP); genetic mutants (atfs-1, haf-1, dve-1) | Example: atfs‑1 deletion largely abolishes induction of hsp‑60/hsp‑6 and hsp‑60 reporters; some perturbations produce large (multi‑fold) reporter induction (see refs) | Methods/review and screens: Haeussler & Conradt, Methods Mol Biol, Jan 2022. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1732-8_16 (haeussler2022methodstostudy pages 16-18); Rauthan & Pilon, Worm, Oct 2015 (chemical reporter screen). https://doi.org/10.1080/21624054.2015.1096490 (rauthan2015achemicalscreen pages 1-3); Bennett et al., Nat Commun, Mar 2014 (atfs‑1/haf‑1 genetics). https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms4483 (bennett2014activationofthe pages 6-6) |

| Regulation by ATFS‑1 / DVE‑1 / HAF‑1 | ATFS‑1 is the principal UPRmt transcriptional activator required for induction of mitochondrial chaperone genes (hsp‑6, hsp‑60); HAF‑1 and DVE‑1 contribute to specific induction contexts (e.g., intestinal responses), while HAF‑1 is not universally required for all perturbations. | Genetic loss/gain (atfs‑1 mutants; haf‑1/dve‑1 RNAi); reporter induction assays | Bennett et al. reported atfs‑1 deletion largely abolishes hsp‑60/hsp‑6 induction; haf‑1 is required in some but not all induction paradigms (some knockdowns still give ~15‑fold induction even when haf‑1 is absent). | Haynes & Hekimi, Genetics, Nov 2022 (UPRmt / ATFS‑1 review). https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyac160 (haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 5-6); Liu et al. 2019 (haf‑1/dve‑1 role in microgravity UPRmt). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-53004-9 (liu2019mitochondrialunfoldedprotein pages 1-2); Bennett et al. 2014 (atfs‑1/haf‑1 genetics, reporter fold‑induction examples). https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms4483 (bennett2014activationofthe pages 6-6) |

| Aging / lifespan linkage | Activation of UPRmt (hsp‑6/hsp‑60 induction) is associated with some longevity paradigms but is neither necessary nor sufficient for lifespan extension in all contexts; constitutive ATFS‑1 activation can be deleterious to longevity. | Lifespan assays with ETC knockdown, constitutive ATFS‑1 mutants, reporter induction correlations | Bennett et al. reported cases where UPRmt induction does not predict longevity and cited ~15‑fold reporter induction examples that did not translate to increased lifespan; constitutive ATFS‑1 activation failed to extend lifespan. | Bennett CF et al., Nat Commun, Mar 2014. https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms4483 (bennett2014activationofthe pages 6-6); Haynes & Hekimi, Genetics, Nov 2022 (review discussion). https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyac160 (haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 5-6) |

*Table: Compact, sourced summary of key facts about C. elegans hsp-60 (UniProt P50140): identity, mechanism, UPRmt reporter usage, triggers, regulation, phenotypes, aging links, recent 2023–2024 findings, and practical applications, with citations to the primary reviews and studies used.*

9) Notes on gene symbol ambiguity and organism specificity
- The symbol hsp-60 can refer to mitochondrial HSP60 homologs in many species. Here, all claims were restricted to C. elegans hsp-60 or conserved HSP60/Cpn60 mechanisms, and the regulatory/phenotypic data were taken from C. elegans sources or cross‑validated reviews. The identity matches the UniProt P50140 annotation, organism is C. elegans, and domain/family annotations agree with the literature (haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 5-6, fink1999chaperonemediatedproteinfolding. pages 6-7, minari2024newinsightsinto pages 3-4).

Conclusions
- C. elegans hsp-60 encodes a mitochondrial HSP60/Cpn60 chaperonin that executes ATP‑driven, HSP‑10–assisted protein folding in the mitochondrial matrix. In worms, hsp‑60 is a core UPRmt target and a widely used reporter readout. Mechanistically, ATFS‑1 is required for hsp‑60 induction, with HAF‑1/DVE‑1 contributing context‑dependently. Functionally, hsp‑60 not only ensures mitochondrial proteostasis but also contributes to innate immunity via p38/PMK‑1 signaling. Recent (2023–2024) studies refine UPRmt’s breadth (immunity, metabolism) and identify mitochondrial SAM as an upstream UPRmt trigger. Importantly, robust UPRmt activation (including hsp‑60 induction) is not a universal predictor of longevity and may be detrimental if chronic (haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 5-6, kim2024regulationofproteostasis pages 1-2, jeong2017mitochondrialchaperonehsp‐60 pages 11-12, bennett2014activationofthe pages 6-6, jeong2017mitochondrialchaperonehsp‐60 pages 3-5).
