description: HSP-60 is the C. elegans mitochondrial matrix chaperonin, a member 
  of the HSP60/GroEL family. It functions as an ATP-dependent protein folding 
  machine that works in concert with the co-chaperonin HSP-10 to assist folding 
  of newly imported mitochondrial proteins and to refold stress-damaged proteins
  in the mitochondrial matrix. HSP-60 assembles into double heptameric rings 
  (tetradecamer) forming a central folding chamber, and the ATP hydrolysis cycle
  drives conformational changes that encapsulate and fold substrate proteins. 
  The hsp-60 gene is a canonical target of the mitochondrial unfolded protein 
  response (UPRmt), regulated by the transcription factor ATFS-1. HSP-60::GFP 
  reporters are widely used as readouts of UPRmt activation. Beyond its 
  chaperone role, a cytosolic fraction of HSP-60 contributes to innate immunity 
  via stabilization of SEK-1 and activation of PMK-1/p38 MAPK signaling.

    review:
      summary: HSP-60 is a bona fide protein folding chaperone. As a member of 
        the GroEL/Cpn60 family, HSP-60 functions as an ATP-dependent protein 
        folding machine in the mitochondrial matrix, assisting newly imported 
        proteins to achieve their native conformation and refolding 
        stress-damaged proteins (Fink 1999, Singh 2024). The IBA annotation is 
        phylogenetically well-supported given the deep conservation of this 
        function across all domains of life.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Protein folding is the core molecular function of HSP-60. The 
        chaperonin mechanism is highly conserved from bacterial GroEL to 
        mitochondrial HSP60, and C. elegans HSP-60 contains all the canonical 
        Cpn60/GroEL domains required for this function. UniProt annotation 
        confirms this function.

    review:
      summary: Human HSPD1/HSP60 has been implicated in apoptotic processes, 
        particularly mitochondrial changes during programmed cell death. 
        However, direct evidence for this role in C. elegans HSP-60 is limited. 
        The annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from mammalian 
        studies.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While HSP60 family members have been linked to apoptosis in 
        mammals (e.g., cytoplasmic release during apoptosis), this represents a 
        secondary/downstream consequence rather than a core function of the C. 
        elegans chaperonin. The primary role of HSP-60 is protein folding in the
        mitochondrial matrix. The annotation is phylogenetically inferred and 
        while not incorrect, represents a non-core function that may be 
        context-dependent.

      summary: HSP-60 is primarily localized to the mitochondrial matrix, not

        during protein import assistance, but the functional localization is the

      reason: The primary and well-established localization of HSP-60/Cpn60 
        family members is the mitochondrial matrix, where they perform their 
        chaperone function. UniProt annotates this as "Mitochondrion matrix." 
        While transient associations with the inner membrane may occur during 
        substrate protein import, the matrix is the canonical functional 
        compartment. The annotation GO:0005759 (mitochondrial matrix) is more

      summary: HSP-60 is implicated in assisting the folding of proteins 
        imported into mitochondria, but its primary role is in the matrix, not 
        specifically the intermembrane space (IMS). The annotation may be too 
        specific regarding the compartment.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: HSP-60 assists protein folding in the mitochondrial matrix and can
        assist newly imported proteins. However, proteins destined for the IMS 
        use distinct import pathways (MIA/CHCHD4 pathway) and HSP-60 primarily 
        functions in the matrix. A more general term related to mitochondrial 
        protein import or matrix protein folding would be more accurate.

      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The HSP-60/HSP-10 interaction is a fundamental aspect of 
        chaperonin function. HSP-10 (Cpn10) is a heptameric lid that binds to

    findings:
      - statement: Landmark paper establishing the UPRmt in C. elegans
        supporting_text: We found that the mitochondrial matrix HSP70 and HSP60 
          chaperones, encoded by the Caenorhabditis elegans hsp-6 and hsp-60 
          genes, were selectively activated by perturbations that impair 
          assembly of multi-subunit mitochondrial complexes
      - statement: hsp-60 and hsp-6 are selectively induced by mitochondrial 
          protein folding stress
        supporting_text: hsp-6 and hsp-60 induction was specific to perturbed 
          mitochondrial protein handling
      - statement: UPRmt is distinct from heat shock and ER stress responses
        supporting_text: neither heat-shock nor endoplasmic reticulum stress nor
          manipulations that impair mitochondrial steps in intermediary 
          metabolism or ATP synthesis activated the mitochondrial chaperone 
          genes

        supporting_text: Unfolded protein stress in the mitochondria correlates 
          with complex formation between a homeodomain-containing transcription 
          factor DVE-1 and the small ubiquitin-like protein UBL-5
      - statement: DVE-1 binds promoters of mitochondrial chaperone genes 
          including hsp-60
        supporting_text: Activation of the UPR(mt) correlates temporally and 
          spatially with nuclear redistribution of DVE-1 and with its enhanced 
          binding to the promoters of mitochondrial chaperone genes
      - statement: ClpP is required for UPRmt signaling
        supporting_text: These events and the downstream UPR(mt) are attenuated

          mitochondrial matrix protease homologous to bacterial ClpP

suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the substrate specificity of C. elegans HSP-60? Are there 
      specific mitochondrial proteins that preferentially require HSP-60 for 
      folding?
  - question: How does the cytosolic fraction of HSP-60 contribute to innate 
      immunity? Is this a regulated process or does it occur constitutively?
  - question: Does HSP-60 have roles in mitochondrial protein import beyond 
      folding newly imported proteins?
suggested_experiments:
  - description: Identify HSP-60 client proteins using proximity labeling 
      (BioID/TurboID) in the mitochondrial matrix under normal and stress 
      conditions.
    hypothesis: HSP-60 has specific client proteins in the mitochondrial matrix 
      that require chaperonin assistance for folding.
  - description: Characterize the cytosolic HSP-60 pool using subcellular 
      fractionation and determine what regulates its distribution between 
      mitochondria and cytosol.
    hypothesis: The cytosolic fraction of HSP-60 is regulated and contributes to
      innate immunity signaling under specific conditions.
  - description: Test whether HSP-60 co-localizes with the TIM/TOM import 
      machinery using super-resolution microscopy.
    hypothesis: HSP-60 interacts with the mitochondrial import machinery to 
      assist folding of newly imported proteins.
