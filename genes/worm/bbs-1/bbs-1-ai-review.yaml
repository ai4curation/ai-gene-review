description: 'BBS-1 is a core component of the BBSome complex in C. elegans, an octameric
  coat complex essential for cilium biogenesis and intraflagellar transport (IFT).
  BBS-1 is required for proper BBSome assembly and its ciliary localization. The protein
  functions in assembling IFT particles at the ciliary base and regulating IFT turnaround
  at the ciliary tip, enabling the recycling of IFT-B components for retrograde transport.
  BBS-1 localizes to ciliated sensory neurons, including amphid and labial neurons
  in the head and phasmid neurons in the tail. Loss of BBS-1 function results in defective
  cilia structure, compromised IFT, and accumulation of IFT-B at the ciliary tip.

    supporting_text: 'the BBSome (refs 3, 4), a group of conserved proteins affected
      in human Bardet-Biedl syndrome(5) (BBS), assembles IFT complexes at the ciliary
      base, then binds to the anterograde IFT particle in a DYF-2- (an orthologue
      of human WDR19) and BBS-1-dependent manner, and lastly reaches the ciliary tip
      to regulate proper IFT recycling

      '

    supporting_text: 'we identified two hypomorphic mutations in dyf-2 and bbs-1 as
      the only mutants showing normal anterograde IFT transport but defective IFT
      turnaround at the ciliary tip

suggested_questions:
- question: What specific cargo proteins does the C. elegans BBSome transport?
- question: Does BBS-1 have functions outside of cilia as suggested for the mammalian
    BBSome?
- question: What is the precise molecular function of BBS-1 within the BBSome complex?
suggested_experiments:
- description: Identify direct cargo proteins of the C. elegans BBSome using proteomics
  hypothesis: The C. elegans BBSome transports specific membrane receptors and signaling
    molecules to cilia
- description: Test for cilia-independent functions of BBS-1 using daf-19 mutant background
  hypothesis: BBS-1 may have additional functions outside of cilia as reported for
    mammalian BBSome
- description: Determine if BBS-1 has specific binding partners among C. elegans membrane
    proteins
  hypothesis: BBS-1 directly binds to specific cargo proteins for ciliary transport
