description: HSF-1 is the C. elegans homolog of mammalian HSF1, functioning as 
  the master transcriptional regulator of the heat shock response. It is a 
  stress-inducible DNA-binding transcription factor that activates expression of
  heat shock proteins (HSPs) and molecular chaperones in response to heat and 
  other proteotoxic stresses. HSF-1 binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) 
  containing inverted 5'-NGAAN-3' pentamer sequences in target gene promoters. 
  Beyond its canonical stress response role, HSF-1 has heat shock-independent 
  developmental functions, including regulation of larval development (in 
  concert with E2F/efl-1) and promotion of linker cell death via activation of 
  the ubiquitin-proteasome system. HSF-1 is essential for lifespan regulation, 
  innate immunity against bacterial pathogens, proteostasis, and autophagy 
  induction. Its activity is regulated by the insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS)
  pathway through formation of the DHIC inhibitory complex with DDL-1/2. HSF-1 
  forms homodimers and homotrimers, localizes constitutively to the nucleus, and
  forms nuclear stress granules upon heat shock.

      summary: HSF-1 is well-established as a DNA-binding transcription factor 
        that activates heat shock gene expression by binding to heat shock 
        elements (HSEs) in target promoters. This function is extensively 
        supported by multiple publications demonstrating HSF-1's transcriptional
        activity in both stress-dependent and stress-independent contexts 
        (PMID:15611166, PMID:22265419, PMID:27688402, PMID:26759377).

      reason: Core molecular function of HSF-1 as a transcription factor is 
        thoroughly validated across multiple independent studies using genetic,
