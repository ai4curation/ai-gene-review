CRITICAL INFORMATION
================================================================================

HSF-1 IS THE MASTER HEAT SHOCK RESPONSE REGULATOR
- DNA-binding transcription factor binding heat shock elements (HSEs)
- Activates heat shock proteins (HSPs) in response to heat stress
- hsf-1 null mutants: >99% loss of heat shock-induced HSP expression
- Evidence: PMID:15611166, PMID:26212459, PMID:26759377

HSF-1 HAS TWO DISTINCT TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROGRAMS
1. Stress Response Program:
   - Tandem canonical HSEs activate heat shock genes
   - Rapid response to thermal/proteotoxic stress
   
2. Developmental Program:
   - Degenerate HSEs adjacent to E2F binding sites
   - Co-regulated with E2F/DP transcription factors
   - Mediates developmental cell death and larval growth
   - Evidence: PMID:27688402, PMID:26952214

HSF-1 LINKS PROTEOSTASIS TO LONGEVITY
- Required for lifespan extension in stress-resistant mutants
- Couples cellular stress response to aging processes
- 2024 evidence: links to mitochondrial remodeling
- Evidence: PMID:14668486, Nature Comm 2024, iScience 2024

SEROTONIN AND ODORANT ANNOTATIONS ARE REGULATORY INPUTS
- Go:0007210: Neuronal serotonin ACTIVATES HSF-1 (not core function)
- GO:1990834: Olfactory experience PRIMES HSF-1 (not odorant sensing)
- These describe upstream neuroendocrine regulation of HSF-1
- Mark as NON-CORE with clarifying documentation

MECHANISM SUMMARY
================================================================================

BASAL STATE (No Stress):
- HSF-1 monomeric
- Sequestered in chaperone complexes (Hsp70/Hsp90)
- Inhibited by DDL-1/2 (IIS pathway)
- Localized to nucleus but transcriptionally inactive

ACUTE STRESS (Heat/Proteotoxins):
- Chaperone titration releases HSF-1
- HR-A/B mediated oligomerization (commonly trimers)
- Cooperative binding to HSEs in promoters
- Rapid transcriptional activation of HSP genes
- Forms nuclear stress granule-like structures

POST-STRESS RECOVERY:
- Chaperone proteins refold misfolded proteins
- Feedback inhibition of HSF-1
- Return to basal monomeric state
- Nuclear stress granules disassemble

DEVELOPMENTAL CONTEXT:
- E2F/DP co-regulation of distinct gene set
- Degenerate HSE + E2F binding site combinations
- Activation of developmental programs
- Promotion of linker cell death via ubiquitin ligase

================================================================================
SPECIES CONTEXT
================================================================================

C. elegans HSF-1 (this gene):
- Single canonical HSF in nematodes
- ~671 amino acids
- Conserved HSF family structure (DNA-binding domain, oligomerization domain)
- Primary proteostasis regulator

Contrast with Mammals:
- HSF1 (stress response - like C. elegans HSF-1)
- HSF2 (developmental/spermatogenesis)
- HSF4 (lens crystallin regulation)
- C. elegans combines these roles in single HSF-1

Evolutionary Conservation:
- HSF family highly conserved (C. elegans to humans)
- DNA-binding domain nearly identical
- IBA (phylogenetic inference) annotations well-supported
