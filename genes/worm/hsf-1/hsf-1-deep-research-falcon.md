## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** G5EFT5
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Heat shock transcription factor hsf-1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:15611166};
- **Gene Information:** Name=hsf-1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y53C10A.12}; ORFNames=Y53C10A.12 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y53C10A.12};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the HSF family. .
- **Key Domains:** HSF_DNA-bd. (IPR000232); WH-like_DNA-bd_sf. (IPR036388); WH_DNA-bd_sf. (IPR036390); HSF_DNA-bind (PF00447)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "hsf-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'hsf-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **hsf-1** (gene ID: hsf-1, UniProt: G5EFT5) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan (excerpt)
- Verified target identity/domain architecture and organism (completed).
- Collected 2023–2024 primary literature and recent reviews (completed).
- Synthesized molecular function, activation/regulation, localization, pathways, and quantitative phenotypes with citations.

Target verification
- Gene symbol and organism: hsf-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans encodes a ~671 aa heat shock transcription factor; this matches UniProt G5EFT5 and WormBase Y53C10A.12. Literature consistently refers to C. elegans HSF-1 as the single canonical HSF-family factor mediating the heat-shock response (HSR) in this organism (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12736-x; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232314907). (schmauder2022bindingofthe pages 1-2, kyriakou2022thethermalstress pages 5-7)
- Protein family/domains: N-terminal winged-helix DNA-binding domain; HR-A/B coiled-coil oligomerization domain antagonized by HR-C; C-terminal transactivation domain; hallmark of HSF family, consistent with UniProt domain annotations (HSF_DNA-bd, WH-like DNA-bd) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12736-x; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42977-022-00138-z). (schmauder2022bindingofthe pages 1-2, kovacs2022functionaldiversificationof pages 3-5)
- Ambiguity check: No conflicting gene symbol usage found for a different protein/organism in the cited sources; all evidence pertains to C. elegans HSF-1.

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Primary molecular function: HSF-1 is the master transcriptional activator of the HSR, binding heat-shock elements (HSEs) to induce chaperones and proteostasis factors. HSEs are arrays of nGAAn pentamers; stable, high-affinity binding typically involves three (trimeric) or extended arrays of 4–5 pentamers, with cooperative DBD occupancy observed in vitro (up to five DBDs on extended HSEs) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12736-x). (schmauder2022bindingofthe pages 1-2)
- HSE architecture in C. elegans: Canonical trimeric HSEs are complemented by extended HSEs in highly inducible promoters (e.g., hsp-16 genes), explaining promoter-selective induction during heat shock (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12736-x). (schmauder2022bindingofthe pages 1-2)
- Developmental vs. heat-shock programs: HSF-1 executes an essential developmental transcriptional program co-regulated by E2F/DP that is distinct from the canonical HSR; developmental targets feature degenerate HSEs adjacent to E2F motifs, whereas HSR targets use tandem canonical HSEs (https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.283317.116). (li2016e2fcoregulatesan pages 1-2)

Activation and regulation (mechanisms)
- Trimerization and DNA binding: In basal conditions, HSF-1 exists in a repressed monomeric state within chaperone-containing complexes (Hsp70/Hsp90) and is constrained by HR-C. Proteotoxic stress titrates chaperones, permitting HR-A/B–mediated oligomerization (commonly trimerization), nuclear binding to HSEs, and transcriptional activation (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-018-2836-6; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42977-022-00138-z). (barna2018rolesofheat pages 1-7, kovacs2022functionaldiversificationof pages 3-5)
- Post-translational modifications: Phosphorylation, acetylation, and SUMOylation modulate HSF-1’s nuclear translocation, promoter occupancy, and transactivation potential; chaperone feedback via Hsp70/Hsp90 attenuates activity (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-018-2836-6). (barna2018rolesofheat pages 1-7)
- Negative regulation by HSB-1: Heat shock factor binding protein 1 (HSB-1) represses HSF-1 by limiting DNA-binding activity under non-stress conditions; hsb-1 loss increases HSF-1 genomic occupancy and produces HSF-1–dependent lifespan extension, with substantial overlap to the hsf-1 overexpression transcriptome (https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.119.400044). (sural2019hsb1inhibitionand pages 1-6)

Subcellular localization and stress-induced structures
- Nuclear residency and stress granule-like assemblies: Physiologically expressed HSF-1::GFP is predominantly nuclear at baseline. After acute heat shock, HSF-1 rapidly forms dynamic subnuclear stress granule-like structures that colocalize with active transcription markers and disassemble during recovery, indicating regulated promoter-proximal assemblies (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12024). (morton2013caenorhabditiseleganshsf‐1 pages 1-1)

Pathways and processes (mechanistic placement)
- Canonical HSR and proteostasis: HSF-1 is essential for robust induction of heat-shock genes (e.g., hsp-70, hsp-16 family) and organismal thermotolerance and recovery; loss-of-function mutations blunt HSP induction and impair heat recovery (https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.283317.116). (li2016e2fcoregulatesan pages 1-2)
- Autophagy and hormesis: Mild heat stress and HSF-1 overexpression induce autophagy across tissues; autophagy genes are required for HSF-1–mediated thermoresistance and lifespan benefits, linking HSR to cytoprotective clearance pathways (https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14337). (kovacs2022functionaldiversificationof pages 3-5)
- Mitochondrial remodeling and fasting: Early-life fasting (24 h) couples mitochondrial clearance/remodeling to potentiation of HSF-1 activity through mitochondrial sirtuins (SIR-2.2/2.3) and chromatin modulation (JMJD-3.1; reduced H3K27me3 at HSF-1 targets). Fasting elevates HSF-1-dependent proteostasis and extends lifespan, requiring HSF-1 and mitophagy/lysosomal factors (hlh-30, pink-1, pdr-1) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.109834). (tataridaspallas2024mitochondrialclearanceand pages 2-3, tataridaspallas2024mitochondrialclearanceand pages 7-9)
- Mitochondrial network dynamics and ubiquilin-1: HSF-1 overexpression promotes longevity through UBQL-1–dependent mitochondrial network remodeling (increased fusion) and down-tuning of CDC-48–UFD-1–NPL-4 components; ubql-1 is required for both mitochondrial fusion and lifespan extension under HSF-1 overexpression (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54136-x). (erinjeri2024hsf1promoteslongevity pages 7-9)
- Developmental program and metabolism: During larval growth, HSF-1 and E2F/DP co-regulate chaperones and biosynthetic genes to support protein biogenesis and anabolic metabolism, separate from the HSR logic (https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.283317.116). (li2016e2fcoregulatesan pages 1-2)
- Inter-tissue regulation: Reviews and syntheses in C. elegans emphasize neuronal and systemic control of HSF-1/HSR and other proteostasis pathways, including cell-nonautonomous signaling that coordinates tissue-wide responses with age and stress (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232314907; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-018-2836-6). (kyriakou2022thethermalstress pages 5-7, barna2018rolesofheat pages 18-22)

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Fasting couples mitophagy and HSF-1 to longevity: A single 24-h fast during late larval/early adult transition reduces mitochondrial copy number by ~30–40%, increases NAD+/mitochondrial sirtuins, potentiates HSF-1 target induction (≈3–4× after acute heat shock), suppresses polyQ aggregation, enhances stress resistance, and extends lifespan. These benefits require HSF-1, SIR-2.2/2.3, and mitophagy/lysosomal genes (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.109834; published Jun 21, 2024). (tataridaspallas2024mitochondrialclearanceand pages 2-3, tataridaspallas2024mitochondrialclearanceand pages 7-9)
- HSF-1→UBQL-1 axis remodels mitochondria to extend life: HSF-1 overexpression drives UBQL-1–dependent mitochondrial fusion; ubql-1 loss suppresses fusion and abrogates HSF-1–mediated lifespan extension, implicating specific organellar proteostasis remodeling rather than broad chaperone upregulation as the key longevity mechanism (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54136-x; published Nov 2024). (erinjeri2024hsf1promoteslongevity pages 7-9)
- Post-stress transcriptome control is partly HSF-1–independent: After hormetic heat stress, long-term transcriptional reprogramming requires the endoribonuclease ENDU-2 independent of HSF-1, separating acute HSR from post-stress remodeling (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39882-8; published Jul 6, 2023). (kovacs2022functionaldiversificationof pages 3-5)

Current applications and implementations
- Healthspan interventions: Transient early-life fasting regimens and genetic modulation of HSF-1 activity (e.g., overexpression; relief from HSB-1 repression) are used in C. elegans to extend lifespan, enhance thermotolerance, and reduce proteotoxic aggregation; these interventions provide assays to identify conserved nodes (sirtuins, mitophagy, UBQL-1) that mechanistically couple proteostasis to mitochondrial dynamics (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.109834; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54136-x; https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.119.400044). (tataridaspallas2024mitochondrialclearanceand pages 2-3, erinjeri2024hsf1promoteslongevity pages 7-9, sural2019hsb1inhibitionand pages 1-6)
- Reporter and imaging platforms: HSF-1::GFP nuclear localization and stress granule-like nuclear foci serve as live readouts of activation thresholds and promoter engagement; these are used to quantify dynamics across genotypes and interventions (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12024). (morton2013caenorhabditiseleganshsf‐1 pages 1-1)

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Reviews emphasize that HSF-1 integrates stress, developmental, and longevity signals, with regulation by chaperone feedback, PTMs, and chromatin context, and acts in concert with other stress pathways (UPR, autophagy). They also highlight systemic regulation of proteostasis with aging and inter-tissue signaling that modulates HSF-1 activity (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-018-2836-6; https://doi.org/10.3389/fragi.2022.861686; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42977-022-00138-z; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232314907). (barna2018rolesofheat pages 1-7, lazaropena2022hsf1guardianof pages 9-10, kovacs2022functionaldiversificationof pages 3-5, kyriakou2022thethermalstress pages 5-7)

Relevant quantitative statistics and data (selected)
- HSE-dependent induction: Fasting potentiates HSF-1 targets ≈3–4× upon subsequent heat shock (e.g., hsp-70, hsp-16 family) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.109834). (tataridaspallas2024mitochondrialclearanceand pages 7-9)
- Mitochondrial copy number: Early-life fasting reduces mitochondrial copy number ≈30–40% within hours; sir-2.2 mutants suppress this reduction (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.109834). (tataridaspallas2024mitochondrialclearanceand pages 7-9)
- Lifespan changes: Early-life fasting extends lifespan (reported ~25% median and maximal increases) in an HSF-1–dependent manner; HSF-1 overexpression extends lifespan, but the benefit is abrogated when ubql-1 is disrupted (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.109834; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54136-x). (tataridaspallas2024mitochondrialclearanceand pages 2-3, erinjeri2024hsf1promoteslongevity pages 7-9)
- Heat recovery and HSP induction: hsf-1 null animals exhibit >99% reduction of hsp-70 and hsp-16.41 induction after heat shock and marked impairment in thermorecovery, confirming the centrality of HSF-1 to HSR (https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.283317.116). (li2016e2fcoregulatesan pages 1-2)

Where and how HSF-1 acts
- Primary site of action: Nucleus of somatic cells (and germline during development), where it binds HSEs in promoters to drive transcription. Nuclear stress induces reversible subnuclear HSF-1 assemblies at active chromatin, consistent with regulated promoter clustering/engagement (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12024; https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.283317.116). (morton2013caenorhabditiseleganshsf‐1 pages 1-1, li2016e2fcoregulatesan pages 1-2)
- Pathway integration: HSF-1 aligns the cytosolic/nuclear proteostasis network with mitochondrial quality control (mitophagy, fusion state), autophagy, and metabolic rewiring, with chromatin regulators (e.g., JMJD-3.1) and longevity pathways (e.g., IIS) modulating its outputs (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.109834; https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.119.400044).

Conclusions
C. elegans HSF-1 (UniProt G5EFT5) is a canonical HSF-family transcription factor that binds multimeric HSEs to drive the HSR and broader proteostasis programs. Its activation is governed by chaperone sequestration, HR-A/B–mediated oligomerization, and extensive PTM and chromatin regulation, with HSB-1 providing negative control. Recent work links HSF-1’s pro-longevity effects to specific mitochondrial quality-control adaptations: early-life fasting couples mitophagy/sirtuin–chromatin axes to HSF-1 potentiation, while HSF-1 overexpression extends lifespan through UBQL-1–dependent mitochondrial network remodeling. HSF-1 also executes a distinct developmental program with E2F/DP, underscoring context-specific transcriptional logic. Together, these data refine HSF-1’s placement at the nexus of nuclear proteostasis, organellar dynamics, and longevity signaling in vivo.
