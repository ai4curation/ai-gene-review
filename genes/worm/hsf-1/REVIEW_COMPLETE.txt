==============================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
==============================================================================

1. HSF-1 is the Master Heat Shock Response Regulator
   - Core molecular function: DNA-binding transcription factor
   - Binds heat shock elements (HSEs) in target gene promoters
   - hsf-1 null mutants show >99% loss of heat-induced HSP expression
   - Evidence: PMID:15611166, PMID:26212459, PMID:26759377

2. Heat-Shock-Independent Developmental Program
   - HSF-1 co-regulates developmental genes with E2F/DP transcription factors
   - Distinct from heat shock response (different HSE architecture)
   - Promotes linker cell death (LCD) via E2F-dependent ubiquitin ligase activation
   - Evidence: PMID:27688402, PMID:26952214

3. Proteostasis and Longevity Linking
   - HSF-1 links cellular stress resistance to lifespan extension
   - Required for longevity in insulin-signaling pathway mutants
   - Recent work (2024) shows coupling to mitochondrial remodeling
   - Evidence: PMID:14668486, Nature Communications 2024, iScience 2024

4. Neuroendocrine Regulation of HSF-1
   - Serotonin signaling from neurons activates HSF-1
   - Olfactory experience with pathogenic odors primes HSF-1
   - These are upstream regulatory INPUTS, not HSF-1 functions
   - Evidence: PMID:25557666, PMID:29042483

5. Immune Defense Through Chaperone Induction
   - HSF-1 required for resistance to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria
   - Mechanism: induction of HSP90 and small heat shock proteins
   - Indirect effect of proteostasis pathway activation
   - Evidence: PMID:16916933, PMID:19454349

==============================================================================
ANNOTATIONS TO REMOVE
==============================================================================

1. GO:0005515 - Protein Binding (IPI, PMID:22265419)
   Problem: Uninformative; violates GO best-practice guidelines
   Context: Reported based on HSF-1 interaction with DDL-1/2
   Issue: 
     - "Protein binding" is too generic to be useful
     - The regulatory consequence (HSF-1 inhibition) is already captured
     - HSF-1 does not form homotrimers with DDL-1/2
   Action: REMOVE this annotation
   Rationale: Non-informative term that violates GO curation principles

2. GO:0005516 - Calmodulin Binding (IPI, PMID:17854888)
   Problem: Physiological relevance unclear; high-throughput screening artifact
   Context: Identified in proteome-wide mRNA-display screen
   Issues:
     - No literature suggests Ca2+/calmodulin regulates HSF-1
     - HSF-1 regulation is well-characterized (chaperones, IIS pathway)
     - Likely false positive from high-throughput screening
   Action: REMOVE this annotation
   Rationale: Insufficient evidence for physiological relevance

==============================================================================
ANNOTATIONS REQUIRING CLARIFICATION
==============================================================================

1. GO:0007210 - Serotonin Receptor Signaling Pathway (IMP)
   Issue: Phrasing suggests HSF-1 "participates in serotonin signaling"
   Reality: Neuronal serotonin release ACTIVATES HSF-1
   Status: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE (with documentation)
   Note: This is an upstream regulatory input to HSF-1, not HSF-1's own function
   Supporting: PMID:25557666, PMID:29042483

2. GO:1990834 - Response to Odorant (IMP)
   Issue: Phrasing suggests HSF-1 "responds to odorants"
   Reality: HSF-1 is primed by olfactory experience (neuromodulation)
   Status: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE (with documentation)
   Note: Upstream neuroendocrine regulation of HSF-1, not odorant sensing
   Supporting: PMID:29042483

COMPARISON WITH EXISTING AI REVIEW
==============================================================================

The existing hsf-1-ai-review.yaml is comprehensive and well-reasoned:

Strengths:
  ✓ Correctly identifies core vs. non-core functions
  ✓ Provides detailed rationale for each action
  ✓ Cites appropriate supporting literature
  ✓ Recognizes mechanistic basis of phenotypes
  ✓ Distinguishes direct functions from downstream effects

Minor Issues to Address:
  - GO:0005515: Marked as MODIFY, should be REMOVE
  - GO:0005516: Marked as UNDECIDED, should be REMOVE
  - GO:0007210, GO:1990834: Could benefit from explicit note that these
    are upstream regulatory inputs, not HSF-1 core functions

Overall Assessment: The existing review demonstrates excellent curation
principles and requires only minor refinements.

==============================================================================
CURATION PRINCIPLES APPLIED
==============================================================================

1. Core vs. Pleiotropic Distinction
   - Core: Stress response, proteostasis, transcription factor activity
   - Non-core: Development, immunity, metabolism (downstream effects)

2. Mechanistic Accuracy
   - Distinguished HSF-1's own functions from regulatory inputs
   - Recognized that immune defense is mediated by chaperone activation

3. Evidence Hierarchy
   - Prioritized IMP/IDA (experimental) over IEA (computational)
   - Validated IBA against direct C. elegans evidence
   - Rejected annotations lacking physiological support

4. GO Best Practices
   - Avoided uninformative "protein binding" term
   - Preferred specific terms over generic parents
   - Ensured mechanistic accuracy of term usage

5. Species-Appropriate Context
   - C. elegans has single canonical HSF (unlike mammals)
   - Annotations reflect monofunctional nature
