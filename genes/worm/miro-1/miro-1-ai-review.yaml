description: MIRO-1 is a mitochondrial Rho GTPase that functions as an outer mitochondrial
  membrane adaptor/scaffold linking mitochondria to cytoskeletal motor proteins for
  transport along microtubules. The protein contains two GTPase domains (N- and C-terminal
  Miro domains) flanking two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. MIRO-1 is tail-anchored
  to the outer mitochondrial membrane and integrates calcium signals with motor engagement,
  facilitating both anterograde (via kinesin) and retrograde (via dynein) mitochondrial
  transport in neurons. Beyond transport, MIRO-1 maintains mitochondrial membrane
  potential through interaction with VDAC-1, and participates in stress-induced mitochondrial
  dynamics including wound-triggered fragmentation. The protein is essential for proper
  mitochondrial distribution in neurons and influences organismal lifespan.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: MIRO-1 contains two Miro GTPase domains (N-terminal and C-terminal) with
      conserved GTP-binding and hydrolysis motifs. The domain architecture is confirmed
      by UniProt annotations showing GTP binding sites at positions 16-23, 62-66,
      123-126 (first GTPase domain) and 433-440, 470-474, 537-540 (second GTPase domain).
      The IBA annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic inference from the mitochondrial
      Rho GTPase family (Aspenstrom 2024, Cells).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core enzymatic function supported by domain architecture and evolutionary
      conservation. The dual GTPase domain structure is characteristic of the Miro
      family and is essential for its function in mitochondrial transport regulation.

      regulatory role of MIRO-1.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Molecular function directly follows from domain architecture. GTP binding
      is confirmed by sequence analysis and is required for the GTPase cycle that

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This is a core function of Miro proteins. In C. elegans, MIRO-1 collaborates
      with MTX-1/2 (metaxins) and TRAK-1 to couple mitochondria to kinesin and dynein
      motors for bidirectional transport. Loss of miro-1 largely immobilizes axonal
      mitochondria (Zhao et al. 2021, Wu et al. 2024).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the primary biological process function of MIRO-1. Multiple C.

    summary: This annotation is transferred from human RHOT1 (Q8IXI2). While Miro
      proteins are targeted by PINK1/Parkin during mitophagy in mammalian systems,
      direct evidence for MIRO-1 involvement in outer membrane permeabilization in
      C. elegans is limited.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: The ISS transfer from human RHOT1 may not fully apply to C. elegans. Outer
      membrane permeabilization is typically associated with apoptosis/mitophagy pathways.
      While Miro proteins are Parkin substrates in mammals, the worm pathway may differ.

      to be informative.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This term is too broad and does not capture specific MIRO-1 function.

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the relationship between MIRO-1's transport function and its role
    in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential through VDAC-1 interaction? These
    appear to be independent functions, but the mechanistic connection and relative
    importance under different physiological conditions is unclear.
- question: Does C. elegans have a functional PINK1/Parkin pathway that targets MIRO-1
    for degradation during mitophagy, as occurs in mammals? The ISS annotation for
    mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization is transferred from human RHOT1
    but the relevance of this pathway in C. elegans is uncertain.
- question: What determines the neuron-specific effects on mitochondrial density observed
    in miro-1 mutants (increased in AIY, decreased in DA9)? Understanding this heterogeneity
    could reveal cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms.
suggested_experiments:
- description: Test GTPase activity of purified MIRO-1 domains in vitro to confirm
    enzymatic function directly in the C. elegans protein. Current GTPase annotations
    are based on domain conservation rather than direct biochemical demonstration
    in the worm protein.
  hypothesis: Purified MIRO-1 GTPase domains will show measurable GTP hydrolysis activity
    comparable to mammalian Miro proteins.
- description: Examine whether C. elegans PINK1/Parkin orthologs (pink-1, pdr-1) target
    MIRO-1 for degradation during mitochondrial stress. This would clarify whether
    the outer membrane permeabilization annotation transferred from human RHOT1 is
    applicable to C. elegans.
  hypothesis: MIRO-1 protein levels will decrease upon mitochondrial depolarization
    in a pink-1 and pdr-1 dependent manner if the PINK1/Parkin pathway is conserved.
