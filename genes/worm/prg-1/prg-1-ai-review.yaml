description: PRG-1 is the main Piwi-class Argonaute protein in C. elegans, 
  functioning as the central effector of the piRNA (21U-RNA) pathway. PRG-1 
  binds 21U-RNAs and localizes to P granules throughout the germline, where it 
  functions in germline surveillance to recognize and silence foreign sequences 
  including transposons. The PRG-1/piRNA pathway triggers gene silencing by 
  recruiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to produce secondary 22G-RNAs that 
  associate with WAGO Argonautes. PRG-1 is essential for fertility, and prg-1 
  mutants show a mortal germline phenotype with transgenerational decline in 
  fertility. PRG-2, the other C. elegans Piwi protein, has little or no 
  detectable function.

    review:
      summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from other Piwi 
        family members. In C. elegans, PRG-1 is primarily localized to 
        cytoplasmic P granules rather than the nucleus (PMID:18501605, 
        PMID:18571452). While some Piwi proteins in other organisms have nuclear
        functions, the experimental evidence in C. elegans shows PRG-1 
        localizing to P granules, which are perinuclear cytoplasmic structures.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: The experimental evidence from C. elegans studies shows PRG-1 
        localizes to P granules, which are cytoplasmic structures 
        (PMID:18501605, PMID:18571452). While the IBA inference is reasonable 
        given nuclear localization of some Piwi proteins in other species, it 
        does not reflect the actual localization of PRG-1 in C. elegans.

    review:
      summary: PRG-1 functions in piRNA-mediated gene silencing in C. elegans. 
        The PRG-1/21U-RNA complex triggers gene silencing of non-self sequences 
        by recruiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to produce WAGO-associated 
        22G-RNAs. This is a core function of the piRNA pathway (PMID:18571452).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation accurately captures the core function of PRG-1 in 
        regulatory ncRNA-mediated gene silencing. PRG-1 binds 21U-RNAs (piRNAs) 
        and uses them to silence target genes, particularly foreign sequences 
        and transposons.

    review:
      summary: IBA annotation based on sequence similarity to other 
        Argonaute/Piwi proteins that have slicer activity. PRG-1 contains PAZ 
        and Piwi domains characteristic of Argonaute proteins. The Piwi domain 
        has RNase H-like fold associated with endonuclease activity in many 
        Argonautes.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: While PRG-1 has the domain architecture of a slicer-competent 
        Argonaute, direct experimental evidence for RNA endonuclease activity of
        C. elegans PRG-1 is not established in the available literature. The 
        primary mechanism of piRNA-mediated silencing in C. elegans appears to 
        involve recruitment of secondary siRNA pathways rather than direct 
        target cleavage. This annotation is plausible but lacks direct 
        experimental validation.

      summary: PRG-1 is required for 21U-RNA (piRNA) accumulation in C. elegans.
        Loss of prg-1 causes a marked reduction in 21U-RNA levels 
        (PMID:18501605, PMID:18571452). However, it is unclear if PRG-1 directly
        participates in piRNA processing or if it stabilizes mature piRNAs after
        processing.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: PRG-1 is clearly involved in piRNA biogenesis/metabolism. The 
        21U-RNAs depend on PRG-1 activity for their accumulation 
        (PMID:18571452). Whether this represents direct processing activity or

      reason: While PRG-1 is required for fertility and germline maintenance, 
        its primary function is in piRNA-mediated gene silencing rather than

    review:
      summary: This term describes cytoplasmic post-transcriptional gene 
        silencing where piRNAs direct mRNA cleavage by PIWI endonuclease

      action: MODIFY
      reason: While PRG-1 is involved in gene silencing, the mechanism in C. 
        elegans appears to primarily involve triggering secondary siRNA

    review:
      summary: Annotation based on early characterization showing prg-1 affects 
        germline cell proliferation. The reduced proliferation of GSC-equivalent
        cells upon piwi knockdown suggests a positive regulatory role in cell 
        division.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While PRG-1 affects germline cell division, this annotation 
        represents a downstream consequence of PRG-1's primary function in 
        piRNA-mediated gene silencing rather than a direct role in mitotic 
        regulation. The effect on cell division is likely indirect through the 
        piRNA pathway's role in maintaining germline integrity.

    findings:
      - statement: PRG-1 is localized to P granules in germ cells entering 
          spermatogenesis and is required for successful spermatogenesis. Loss 
          of prg-1 causes reduced expression of spermatogenesis transcripts and 
          sperm activation/fertilization defects. PRG-1 is required for 21U-RNA 
          presence.

    findings:
      - statement: 21U-RNAs are the piRNAs of C. elegans and interact with 
          PRG-1. PRG-1 localizes to P granules throughout development. 21U-RNA 
          accumulation depends on PRG-1 activity. The PRG-1/21U-RNA complex is 
          required for temperature-dependent fertility maintenance.

suggested_questions:
  - question: Does PRG-1 have direct slicer (RNA endonuclease) activity, or does
      it function primarily through recruitment of secondary siRNA pathways?
  - question: What is the precise mechanism by which PRG-1 contributes to 
      21U-RNA accumulation - direct processing, stabilization, or both?
suggested_experiments:
  - description: In vitro slicer assay with purified PRG-1 to determine if it 
      has direct RNA endonuclease activity.
    hypothesis: PRG-1 may have catalytic slicer activity similar to other Piwi 
      proteins, or may lack this activity if the C. elegans piRNA pathway 
      operates primarily through secondary siRNA recruitment.
  - description: Structural analysis of PRG-1 catalytic site to assess DDH motif
      integrity and predicted catalytic competence.
    hypothesis: Analysis of the catalytic residues in the Piwi domain will 
      reveal whether PRG-1 has the conserved DDH motif required for endonuclease
      activity.
