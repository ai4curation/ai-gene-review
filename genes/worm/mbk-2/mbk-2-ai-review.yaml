description: 'MBK-2 (minibrain kinase 2) is a DYRK (Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-Regulated
  Kinase) family member that serves as a master regulator of the oocyte-to-embryo
  transition in C. elegans. As a dual-specificity kinase, MBK-2 phosphorylates both
  serine/threonine and tyrosine residues on key substrate proteins. Its primary functions
  include: (1) promoting the degradation of oocyte proteins (MEI-1/katanin, OMA-1,
  OMA-2) during meiotic maturation by marking them for proteasomal destruction, (2)
  regulating P granule dynamics by phosphorylating MEG-1 and MEG-3 to promote granule
  disassembly in the anterior cytoplasm during zygote polarization, (3) priming MEX-5
  and MEX-6 for polo kinase-dependent phosphorylation to regulate embryonic polarity,
  and (4) contributing to spindle positioning and asymmetric cell division in early
  embryos. MBK-2 is activated during oocyte maturation by CDK-1-dependent phosphorylation
  and is sequestered at the cell cortex by the pseudophosphatases EGG-3, EGG-4, and
  EGG-5 until the meiotic divisions. The human ortholog DYRK3 has analogous functions
  in dissolving stress granules and mitotic condensates.'

  description: MBK-2 is a DYRK family kinase with demonstrated dual-specificity activity.
    In vitro kinase assays show it phosphorylates substrates including MEI-1, OMA-1,
    MEX-5/6, and MEG-1/3 at serine/threonine residues (PMID:16338136, PMID:16289132,
    PMID:18199581, PMID:25535836). MBK-2 also autophosphorylates at tyrosine-621 in
    its YTY activation motif (PMID:19879842). Through phosphorylation of substrates,
    MBK-2 regulates P granule disassembly, oocyte protein degradation during the oocyte-to-embryo
    transition, and asymmetric localization of cell fate determinants.

  review:
    summary: While MBK-2 is primarily cytoplasmic and cortical in C. elegans early
      embryos, this IBA annotation likely reflects nuclear localization observed in
      orthologous DYRK family members in other species.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The IBA annotation reflects phylogenetic inference from other DYRK family
      members. In C. elegans, MBK-2 is predominantly at the cortex, cytoplasm, and
      on mitotic structures rather than in the nucleus. However, the annotation is
      not incorrect for the broader DYRK family.
