description: SIR-2.1 is the C. elegans ortholog of yeast Sir2 and mammalian SIRT1,
  functioning as an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase. It deacetylates histones (particularly
  H4K16, H3K9, and H3K14) and interacts with key regulatory proteins including DAF-16/FOXO
  and 14-3-3 proteins (FTT-2 and PAR-5). SIR-2.1 plays roles in chromatin silencing
  at subtelomeric regions, lifespan regulation (though its overexpression effects
  on longevity have been controversial), stress response, DNA damage-induced apoptosis,
  and dauer larval development. It links NAD+ metabolism to chromatin regulation and
  transcriptional control. During DNA damage-induced apoptosis, SIR-2.1 translocates
  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it participates in a proapoptotic pathway
  parallel to CEP-1/p53.

    reason: IBA from yeast SIR2 and SIRT1 is reasonable given the conserved substrate
      specificity of Class I sirtuins. While direct experimental evidence for H3K14

      signaling pathway affecting dauer formation. However, dauer development is more
      directly regulated by the core insulin signaling components; SIR-2.1's role
      is more peripheral.
