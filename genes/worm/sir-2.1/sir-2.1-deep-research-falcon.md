### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q21921
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sir-2.1; EC=2.3.1.286 {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00236}; AltName: Full=Protein sir-2.1; AltName: Full=Regulatory protein SIR2 homolog 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=sir-2.1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:R11A8.4a}; ORFNames=R11A8.4 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:R11A8.4a};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the sirtuin family. Class I subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** DHS-like_NAD/FAD-binding_dom. (IPR029035); NAD-dep_sirtuin_deacylases. (IPR050134); Sirtuin. (IPR003000); Sirtuin_cat_small_dom_sf. (IPR026591); Ssirtuin_cat_dom. (IPR026590)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "sir-2.1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'sir-2.1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **sir-2.1** (gene ID: sir-2.1, UniProt: Q21921) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: sir-2.1 (UniProt Q21921) encodes the C. elegans ortholog of yeast Sir2 and mammalian SIRT1. It is an NAD-dependent class I sirtuin deacetylase whose catalytic reaction generates nicotinamide (NAM) and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (O-AADPR) along with a deacetylated lysine substrate, consistent with the provided domain annotations for sirtuin catalytic cores (DHS-like NAD-binding and sirtuin domains). No conflicting gene with the same symbol was found in the cited literature for other organisms; the organism context is C. elegans throughout (all citations below) (north2004sirtuinssir2relatednaddependent pages 6-7, imai2010tenyearsof pages 1-2, tissenbaum2001increaseddosageof pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Protein family and domains: sir-2.1 belongs to the sirtuin (Sir2) family, class I subfamily. Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent lysine deacetylases. The conserved catalytic core binds NAD+ and acetyl-lysine, producing NAM and O-AADPR; stoichiometry of products is approximately 1:1:1 with the deacetylated peptide (NAD+ cleavage is mechanistically coupled to deacetylation) (Genome Biology review 2004, North & Verdin; Trends Pharmacol Sci 2010, Imai & Guarente; URLs: https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2004-5-5-224; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2010.02.003; publication dates: April 2004; May 2010) (north2004sirtuinssir2relatednaddependent pages 6-7, imai2010tenyearsof pages 1-2).
- Catalytic activity and substrates/products: As an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, sir-2.1 removes acetyl groups from lysine residues of protein substrates, converting NAD+ to NAM and O-AADPR. This activity is sensitive to cellular NAD+ levels and integrates metabolic state with chromatin and protein regulation (same sources as above) (north2004sirtuinssir2relatednaddependent pages 6-7, imai2010tenyearsof pages 1-2).
- Core biological role in C. elegans: Overexpression/increased dosage of sir-2.1 extends lifespan and acts within or upstream of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) to regulate the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. This established sir-2.1 as a longevity regulator and metabolic sensor linking NAD+ state to gene expression and stress responses (Nature 2001; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/35065638; publication date: March 2001) (tissenbaum2001increaseddosageof pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- 2024 review updates on localization and NAD metabolism links: A 2024 peer-reviewed review summarizes sir-2.1 as a SIRT1 homolog localized to nucleus and mitochondria, embedded in the NAD+ salvage network (interaction with nicotinamidase pnc-1) and functionally intersecting with IIS/DAF-16 signaling. It reiterates that activation or overexpression of sir-2.1 extends lifespan, whereas loss of function shortens it (Current Research in Food Science 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crfs.2024.100809; publication date: July 2024) (cho2024developmentofaging pages 1-3).
- 2024 experimental study—sir-2.1 requirement for small-molecule longevity: Magnolol treatment extended lifespan, enhanced resistance to heat, H2O2, MeHgCl, and paraquat, reduced ROS and lipid peroxidation (MDA), and increased SOD and catalase activities. The lifespan extension was reversed in sir-2.1(ok434) and IIS-pathway mutants (daf-2, age-1, daf-16, skn-1, hsf-1), supporting a mechanistic requirement for sir-2.1 and IIS/stress-response pathways in the pro-longevity effect (Scientific Reports 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53374-9; publication date: February 2024) (yu2024magnololextendslifespan pages 1-2).
- 2024 overview of sir-2.1 in aging and photoaging contexts: A 2024 review highlights sir-2.1 as the C. elegans SIRT1 ortholog positioned within DAF-16/FOXO regulatory networks. It notes host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) functions downstream of SIR-2.1 and physically interacts with DAF-16 to influence lifespan and DAF-16-dependent transcription, aligning SIR-2.1 with broader stress response and proteostasis pathways (Biomolecules 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14101235; publication date: September 2024) (jeayeng2024caenorhabditiselegansas pages 2-3).
- Refined biochemical pathway downstream of sirtuin activity: Methylation of nicotinamide (NAM) via the C. elegans NNMT ortholog anmt-1 to form 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) is required for sir-2.1-mediated lifespan extension; MNA metabolism generates H2O2 as a mitohormetic signal. High NAM is deleterious (25 mM shortens lifespan), and loss of anmt-1 abrogates sir-2.1’s longevity benefits (Nature Chemical Biology 2013; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/nchembio.1352; publication date: November 2013) (schmeisser2013roleofsirtuins pages 1-3).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- C. elegans as a screening platform for pro-longevity interventions that engage sir-2.1: The 2024 magnolol study demonstrates a practical pipeline—compound exposure, genetic epistasis with sir-2.1 and IIS nodes, and functional assays of stress resistance—to identify and validate longevity compounds requiring sir-2.1. Such studies exploit sir-2.1 mutants to deconvolute mechanisms and prioritize candidates (yu2024magnololextendslifespan pages 1-2).
- Targeting NAD metabolism to modulate sir-2.1 function: Reviews emphasize the centrality of cellular NAD+ for sirtuin catalysis, motivating nutritional or pharmacological strategies that replenish NAD+ (e.g., via salvage pathways) as a route to influence sir-2.1 activity and downstream stress/aging phenotypes (imai2010tenyearsof pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanism and products are conserved: Genome Biology (2004) and Trends in Pharmacological Sciences (2010) reviews provide expert consensus that Sir2-family enzymes, including sir-2.1, catalyze NAD+-dependent deacetylation with characteristic products (NAM, O-AADPR) and function as metabolic sensors. These reviews also discuss modulation by small molecules (e.g., NAM inhibition) and the broader regulatory landscape, supporting conserved enzymology and pathway integration (north2004sirtuinssir2relatednaddependent pages 6-7, imai2010tenyearsof pages 1-2).
- Pathway placement: The original Nature 2001 study and subsequent reviews place sir-2.1 upstream of or interacting with IIS-DAF-16/FOXO. More recent reviews add downstream co-regulators (HCF-1) and ties to autophagy and proteostasis, reinforcing a central signaling role that aligns with nutrient-sensing and stress-response networks (tissenbaum2001increaseddosageof pages 1-2, jeayeng2024caenorhabditiselegansas pages 2-3, cho2024developmentofaging pages 1-3).
- Redox and NAM/MNA axis: The Nature Chemical Biology 2013 study reframes aspects of the sirtuin–longevity link around NAM metabolism and mitohormesis, consistent with sirtuins’ integration of metabolic/redox state with organismal aging (schmeisser2013roleofsirtuins pages 1-3).

Relevant statistics and data from recent and foundational studies
- Lifespan extension with sir-2.1 overexpression: Free-duplication strain including sir-2.1 and sir-2.1 transgenics showed significant increases in mean and maximum lifespan. Reported mean lifespans for three transgenic lines were 20.9 ± 0.3, 27.4 ± 1.0, and 22.4 ± 0.4 days versus controls ~17.6–18.2 days (P < 0.05). Overall extension reported up to ~50% in certain contexts (Nature 2001) (tissenbaum2001increaseddosageof pages 1-2).
- NAM toxicity and requirement for methylation: High NAM (25 mM) reduces lifespan; loss of anmt-1 abolishes sir-2.1-mediated lifespan extension, indicating the NAM→MNA axis is necessary for the longevity phenotype (Nat Chem Biol 2013) (schmeisser2013roleofsirtuins pages 1-3).
- Stress resistance coordinated with sir-2.1: Magnolol increased resistance to heat, H2O2, MeHgCl, and paraquat and upregulated antioxidant defenses (SOD, CAT), but these benefits required sir-2.1 and IIS components. The study reports reversal of lifespan extension in sir-2.1(ok434) and daf-2/age-1/daf-16/skn-1/hsf-1 mutants, demonstrating epistatic dependency (Sci Rep 2024) (yu2024magnololextendslifespan pages 1-2).

Subcellular localization
- The 2024 review by Cho & Park reports sir-2.1 localization in the nucleus and mitochondria, consistent with its roles in chromatin regulation and mitochondrial function/metabolism. Integration with NAD+ salvage (pnc-1) and mitochondrial functional readouts supports dual localization or functional coupling across compartments (Current Research in Food Science 2024) (cho2024developmentofaging pages 1-3).

Pathways and mechanistic placement in C. elegans
- IIS/DAF-16 (FOXO): sir-2.1 acts within or upstream of IIS to regulate DAF-16-dependent transcription that governs stress resistance, metabolism, and longevity. Genetic data support sir-2.1’s requirement for lifespan extension by certain interventions and its ability to extend lifespan when overexpressed (Nature 2001; Sci Rep 2024) (tissenbaum2001increaseddosageof pages 1-2, yu2024magnololextendslifespan pages 1-2).
- HSF-1 and SKN-1 axes: The magnolol study shows dependence on hsf-1 and skn-1, implicating SIR-2.1 in coupling proteostasis (heat shock response) and phase II detoxification/oxidative stress defenses (Nrf2/SKN-1-like pathway) to longevity, consistent with broader stress-response integration described in 2024 reviews (Sci Rep 2024; Biomolecules 2024) (yu2024magnololextendslifespan pages 1-2, jeayeng2024caenorhabditiselegansas pages 2-3).
- NAD/NAM/MNA and redox signaling: sir-2.1’s enzymatic product NAM feeds into anmt-1 to produce MNA, whose metabolism provokes mitohormetic H2O2 signals necessary for sirtuin-linked lifespan extension (Nat Chem Biol 2013) (schmeisser2013roleofsirtuins pages 1-3).

*Table: Concise, source-mapped table summarizing key experimental and review evidence for C. elegans sir-2.1 (identity, enzymology, pathways, localization, and recent 2023–2024 findings) with context IDs for traceability.*

Caveats and open questions
- Substrate specificity in vivo in C. elegans remains incompletely enumerated at a proteome scale; however, the enzymatic chemistry and product profile are conserved and well-established for class I sirtuins (north2004sirtuinssir2relatednaddependent pages 6-7, imai2010tenyearsof pages 1-2).
- Reported sir-2.1 localization includes nucleus and mitochondria per review; finer-resolution immunolocalization and condition-dependent shuttling in C. elegans tissues may vary and merit dedicated primary-source confirmation beyond the review summary (cho2024developmentofaging pages 1-3).
