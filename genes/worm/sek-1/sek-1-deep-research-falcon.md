## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** G5EDF7
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase sek-1 {ECO:0000305|PubMed:11751572}; Short=MAP kinase kinase sek-1 {ECO:0000305}; EC=2.7.12.2 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11751572};
- **Gene Information:** Name=sek-1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:R03G5.2}; ORFNames=R03G5.2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:R03G5.2};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. STE Ser/Thr
- **Key Domains:** Kinase-like_dom_sf. (IPR011009); Prot_kinase_dom. (IPR000719); Protein_kinase_ATP_BS. (IPR017441); Ser/Thr_kinase_AS. (IPR008271); Pkinase (PF00069)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "sek-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'sek-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **sek-1** (gene ID: sek-1, UniProt: G5EDF7) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

*Blockquote: A concise verification that C. elegans sek-1 (UniProt G5EDF7) is a dual-specificity MAPKK in the NSY-1→SEK-1→PMK-1/PMK-2 p38 pathway, lists key domains, and warns against cross-species symbol confusion.*

Comprehensive research report: sek-1 (UniProt: G5EDF7) in Caenorhabditis elegans

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
• Molecular identity and domain architecture: sek-1 encodes the C. elegans MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK; MKK3/6 ortholog) in the canonical p38 MAPK module. Genetic and biochemical evidence places SEK-1 downstream of the MAPKKK NSY-1 and upstream of the p38 MAPKs PMK-1 and PMK-2. SEK-1 activity is necessary for PMK-1 activation in vivo; biochemical experiments showed that SEK-1 can phosphorylate and activate p38 when expressed heterologously. These findings are consistent with its classification in the STE Ser/Thr kinase family with a conserved Pkinase catalytic domain and kinase-like fold, supporting dual-specificity MAPKK function (Journal of Biochemistry review, Jul 2004, https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvh097; G3, Sep 2017, https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.117.043273) (sakaguchi2004rolesofmap pages 3-4, hoyt2017thesek1p38 pages 1-2).
• Canonical pathway: NSY-1 (MAPKKK) → SEK-1 (MAPKK) → PMK-1/PMK-2 (p38 MAPKs). This module is a central conduit for stress and innate immune signaling, and it is redeployed in neurons for development and behavior. Reviews and genetics place sek-1 as the MKK3/6-like node in this conserved cascade (JBC review, Apr 2016, https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.r115.711101) (andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 7-8, andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 3-4, andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 4-5).
• Enzymatic role/substrate specificity: As a dual-specificity MAPKK, SEK-1 phosphorylates conserved threonine and tyrosine residues in the activation loop of p38 MAPKs (here PMK-1/PMK-2). In vivo, depletion of sek-1 diminishes PMK-1 phosphorylation during infection, consistent with direct MAPKK function upstream of PMK-1 (Protein & Cell, Dec 2013, https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-012-2080-z) (xu2013caenorhabditiselegansmom4 pages 2-4).

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
• Behavioral plasticity and learning (salt chemotaxis): 2023 genetic dissection shows that NSY-1/SEK-1 signaling in sensory neurons (ASER, ASH, ADF) is required for high-salt attractive learning. Neuronal expression of sek-1 rescued learning defects, whereas immobility was not fully rescued, revealing separable neuronal versus non-neuronal functions. PMK-2 acts partly redundantly with PMK-1 downstream of SEK-1. Reported statistics include ANOVA with ***P < 0.001 and sample sizes of N ≈ 9–15 assays (G3, Jun 2023, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkad129) (huang2023multiplep38jnkmitogenactivated pages 7-10, huang2023multiplep38jnkmitogenactivated pages 12-12).
• Chemotherapy/toxin stress (cisplatin): In adult, post-mitotic tissues, cisplatin triggers activation of the p38 MAPK cascade, leading to PMK-1 and ATF-7 phosphorylation and a broad proteomic immune signature. The TIR-1 → NSY-1 → SEK-1 → PMK-1 axis is necessary for resilience to cisplatin; proteomics identified 3,586 proteins with altered abundance (FDR < 0.05), with 121 upregulated >2-fold and 158 downregulated <−2-fold, enriched for innate immune proteins. The authors show SEK-1 is specifically required in adult somatic cells for protection (Nature Communications, May 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7).
• Antimicrobial peptide modulation of p38 signaling: A designed antimicrobial peptide (2K4L) protected C. elegans from Acinetobacter baumannii, dampening infection-induced activation of the p38/PMK-1 pathway. Quantitatively, infection upregulated pathway transcripts (e.g., atf-7 ≈126-fold; pmk-1/skn-1/abf-2 ≈60-fold; tir-1/sek-1/abf-2 ≈4–17-fold), while 2K4L treatment reduced phosphorylated p38 by 40–47% and lowered ROS by ~27–45%, restoring SOD from ~10 to 18–40 U/mg (Scientific Reports, Jul 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64511-9) (ji2024antimicrobialpeptide2k4l pages 6-8).
• Contemporary overview in infection biology: A 2024 review synthesizes how the PMK-1/p38 pathway orchestrates responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence factors and is integrated with redox signaling and metabolic surveillance; although sek-1 is not singled out in the excerpt, it functions as the pathway’s MAPKK (IJMS, Jun 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137034) (hajdu2024modelinghost–pathogeninteractions pages 10-12).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
• Innate immunity model in vivo: The NSY-1/SEK-1/PMK-1 module is a cornerstone for modeling innate immune defenses against Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter) and for quantifying host resilience to xenobiotics such as cisplatin. Its genetic tractability and phospho-readouts (p-PMK-1) enable mechanism-based evaluation of anti-infective peptides and probiotic/postbiotic interventions (Protein & Cell 2013, https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-012-2080-z; Sci Rep 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64511-9; Nat Commun 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5) (xu2013caenorhabditiselegansmom4 pages 2-4, ji2024antimicrobialpeptide2k4l pages 6-8, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7).
• Neuroscience of learning and behavioral modulation: Neuron-specific sek-1 manipulations in defined sensory neurons provide a platform for dissecting learning rules (e.g., salt chemotaxis), circuit-level neuromodulation, and cross-talk with other MAPK branches (G3 2023, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkad129) (huang2023multiplep38jnkmitogenactivated pages 7-10, huang2023multiplep38jnkmitogenactivated pages 12-12).

4) Expert opinions and analyses from authoritative sources
• Context-specific deployment: A JBC expert review emphasizes that stress-activated MAPK components are reused in distinct cellular contexts, with SEK-1 operating in the intestine for innate immunity, the epidermis for antifungal defense, and neurons for development and behavior, underscoring modular reuse and cross-talk with JNK modules (JBC, Apr 2016, https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.r115.711101) (andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 7-8, andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 3-4, andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 4-5).
• Foundational mechanistic placement and biochemical readouts: A Journal of Biochemistry review summarizes genetics and biochemical assays demonstrating that NSY-1, SEK-1, and PMK-1 form a kinase cascade; endogenous PMK-1 activity is reduced in nsy-1 and sek-1 mutants, and SEK-1 can activate p38 in heterologous systems (J Biochem, Jul 2004, https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvh097) (sakaguchi2004rolesofmap pages 3-4).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
• Pathogen survival kinetics: In Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 infections, wild-type worms begin to succumb at ≈34 h, whereas hypersusceptible mutants in the p38 module (nsy-1, sek-1, pmk-1) die earlier, ≈16–30 h, demonstrating functional necessity for host defense (JBC, Apr 2016, https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.r115.711101) (andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 3-4, andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 4-5).
• PMK-1 phosphorylation assays (in vivo readout of SEK-1 function): RNAi or mutation of sek-1 reduces PMK-1 phosphorylation in response to acute PA14 exposure; experimental conditions include synchronized young adults transferred to PA14 lawns with 3-h exposures before anti-phospho-p38 western blotting (Protein & Cell, Dec 2013, https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-012-2080-z) (xu2013caenorhabditiselegansmom4 pages 2-4).
• Learning behavior metrics: Salt chemotaxis learning deficits in sek-1 mutants are rescued by neuron-specific sek-1 expression (ASER, ASH, ADF); learning indices exhibit significant restoration with ANOVA ***P < 0.001; typical replicate counts N ≈ 9–15 assays (G3, Jun 2023, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkad129) (huang2023multiplep38jnkmitogenactivated pages 7-10, huang2023multiplep38jnkmitogenactivated pages 12-12).
• Cisplatin-evoked proteome remodeling via p38: In adults exposed to cisplatin, 3,586 proteins changed (FDR < 0.05), with 121 >2-fold up and 158 <−2-fold, enriching innate immune categories; PMK-1 and ATF-7 phosphorylation increased, and pathway genetics (tir-1, nsy-1, sek-1, pmk-1) determine resilience (Nat Commun, May 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7).
• Pharmacologic modulation during infection: With Acinetobacter infection, atf-7 shows ≈126-fold induction; pmk-1/skn-1/abf-2 ≈60-fold; tir-1/sek-1/abf-2 ≈4–17-fold. 2K4L reduces p-p38 by 40–47% and lowers ROS by ~27–45%, restoring SOD from ~10 U/mg to 18–40 U/mg (Sci Rep, Jul 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64511-9) (ji2024antimicrobialpeptide2k4l pages 6-8).

Functional roles, processes, and localization
• Innate immunity: The NSY-1/SEK-1/PMK-1 module is essential for resistance to bacterial pathogens. sek-1 is required for PMK-1 phosphorylation during infection and for normal survival kinetics on pathogenic lawns, acting predominantly in the intestine for defense gene activation (Protein & Cell 2013, https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-012-2080-z; JBC 2016, https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.r115.711101) (xu2013caenorhabditiselegansmom4 pages 2-4, andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 4-5, andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 3-4).
• Neuronal development and behavior: SEK-1 functions in acetylcholine neurons to modulate locomotion and Gq (EGL-30) signaling; the pathway can suppress hyperactive NCA-1/NALCN, positioning SEK-1 as a modulatory node of neuronal excitability. In learning, SEK-1 acts in ASER/ASH/ADF to promote high-salt attraction after conditioning, with PMK-1/PMK-2 acting redundantly downstream (G3 2017, https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.117.043273; G3 2023, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkad129) (hoyt2017thesek1p38 pages 1-2, huang2023multiplep38jnkmitogenactivated pages 7-10, huang2023multiplep38jnkmitogenactivated pages 12-12).
• Epidermal antifungal responses: Reviews synthesize evidence that the same module contributes to epidermal defense during fungal infection (JBC 2016, https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.r115.711101) (andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 4-5).

*Table: A concise, cited table summarizing major findings about C. elegans SEK-1 (UniProt G5EDF7): function, pathway partners, tissues, quantitative notes, and source DOIs with context IDs for traceability.*

Expert analysis and perspective
SEK-1 is the central MAPKK integrating upstream danger signals (e.g., TIR-1/SARM1- and calcium/CaMKII/UNC-43-dependent activation of NSY-1) with downstream transcriptional programs via PMK-1/PMK-2 and ATF-7/SKN-1. The latest work extends this paradigm from classical infection biology to post-mitotic resilience to chemotherapeutics (cisplatin) and to defined forms of learning (salt chemotaxis), revealing that SEK-1’s context-specific deployment spans epithelial immunity and neuronal plasticity. Quantitative readouts (p-PMK-1 immunoblots, survival curves, behavioral assay statistics, and proteomics) provide convergent, mechanistic support for SEK-1’s role as the activating MAPKK in this pathway (JBC 2016, G3 2017/2023, Nat Commun 2023, Sci Rep 2024) (andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 4-5, hoyt2017thesek1p38 pages 1-2, huang2023multiplep38jnkmitogenactivated pages 7-10, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7, ji2024antimicrobialpeptide2k4l pages 6-8).

Notes on ambiguity and organism specificity
The sek-1 symbol is used in C. elegans for the p38 MAPKK; mammalian MKK3/6 are homologs but not the research target here. All evidence cited above pertains to the C. elegans sek-1 gene/protein, consistent with the UniProt entry G5EDF7 and its kinase domain architecture (sakaguchi2004rolesofmap pages 3-4, hoyt2017thesek1p38 pages 1-2, andrusiak2016contextspecificityof pages 7-8).
