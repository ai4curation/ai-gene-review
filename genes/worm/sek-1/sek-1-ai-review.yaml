description: 'SEK-1 is a dual-specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
  (MAPKK) that functions as a central component of the conserved p38 MAPK signaling
  cascade (nsy-1 -> sek-1 -> pmk-1). This kinase phosphorylates and activates PMK-1
  (the C. elegans p38 MAPK ortholog) on both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues.
  SEK-1 plays essential roles in two major biological processes: (1) innate immune
  responses against bacterial and fungal pathogens, where it activates PMK-1-dependent
  transcription of antimicrobial peptides and stress response genes; and (2) asymmetric
  neuronal cell fate determination in the AWC olfactory neurons, where it acts downstream
  of calcium/CaMKII signaling to repress str-2 expression. SEK-1 is also involved
  in oxidative stress responses via PMK-1-mediated nuclear localization of SKN-1 and
  stabilization of RNT-1. The protein is activated by NSY-1 (MAPKKK)-mediated phosphorylation
  at Ser-204 and Thr-208.'

  review:
    summary: SEK-1 is definitively part of the p38 MAPK cascade, functioning between
      NSY-1 (MAPKKK) and PMK-1 (p38 MAPK). This has been demonstrated in multiple
      studies showing the signaling hierarchy (PMID:11751572, PMID:12142542). The
      phylogenetic inference from PAINT is consistent with experimental data.
