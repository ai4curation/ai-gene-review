description: WAGO-1 (Worm-specific Argonaute 1) is a member of the WAGO subfamily
  of Argonaute proteins that functions as a key effector in the endogenous small interfering
  RNA (endo-siRNA) pathway in the C. elegans germline. WAGO-1 binds 22G-RNAs, which
  are RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-derived secondary siRNAs characterized by their
  22-nucleotide length and 5'-guanosine. Unlike canonical Argonaute proteins, WAGO
  subfamily members lack conserved metal-binding residues required for catalytic slicer
  activity and likely function through recruitment of other nucleases for target degradation.
  WAGO-1 localizes to P granules (germline nuage structures) where it functions in
  a genome surveillance system to silence transposons, pseudogenes, and cryptic loci.
  WAGO-1 acts downstream of the primary Argonaute PRG-1 in the piRNA pathway, where
  piRNA-triggered 22G-RNA production leads to loading of these secondary siRNAs into
  WAGO-1 and HRDE-1. WAGO-1 interacts with the Vasa homolog RDE-12 and the zinc-finger
  helicase ZNFX-1 as part of the RNA silencing machinery. The protein is enriched
  in sperm and oocytes and is essential for germline integrity and transposon control.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from other Argonaute family
      members. While some Argonaute proteins do localize to the nucleus, the primary
      literature for WAGO-1 specifically demonstrates cytoplasmic P granule localization
      in the germline (PMID:19800275, PMID:24684931). UniProt annotation describes
      WAGO-1 subcellular location as "Cytoplasmic granule" with no nuclear localization
      reported.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: WAGO-1 has been experimentally characterized as localizing to cytoplasmic
      P granules (PMID:19800275). The nuclear annotation appears to be an over-generalization
      from other Argonaute family members. WAGO-1 functions in cytoplasmic post-transcriptional
      gene silencing and there is no direct evidence for nuclear localization in C.
      elegans.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for cytoplasmic localization is broadly consistent with
      experimental evidence showing WAGO-1 in cytoplasmic P granules. However, the
      more specific term GO:0043186 (P granule) is preferable as it captures the precise
      subcellular localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Cytoplasmic localization is accurate - WAGO-1 localizes to cytoplasmic
      P granules (PMID:19800275, PMID:24684931). This is a valid parent term for the
      more specific P granule localization. Retaining as it provides broader context.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This annotation is phylogenetically inferred from slicer-competent Argonaute
      proteins. However, WAGO subfamily Argonautes specifically lack the conserved
      metal-binding residues (DDH/DDX catalytic tetrad) required for endonuclease
      activity. UniProt explicitly notes that WAGO subfamily members lack conserved
      metal-binding residues and probably do not cleave target mRNAs directly (PMID:17110334).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: WAGO-1 lacks the catalytic tetrad required for RNA endonuclease (slicer)
      activity. This is a known distinguishing feature of the WAGO subfamily. The
      protein likely recruits other endonucleases for target degradation rather than
      performing cleavage itself. This annotation is an over-annotation based on ancestral
      function that has been lost in this subfamily.

  review:
    summary: WAGO-1 is a central effector in the 22G-RNA pathway, which is a form
      of endo-siRNA-mediated gene silencing. The protein binds 22G-RNAs and mediates
      silencing of transposons, pseudogenes, and aberrant transcripts in the germline

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures WAGO-1's primary biological function.
      WAGO-1 participates in a regulatory ncRNA-mediated silencing pathway using endogenous

  review:
    summary: As an Argonaute protein that binds small RNAs and mediates gene silencing,
      WAGO-1 functions as part of an RNA-induced silencing complex. While the worm-specific
      WAGO-1-containing complex may have distinct features, RISC complex is an appropriate
      general term for Argonaute-containing silencing effector complexes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: WAGO-1 is the core Argonaute component of a small RNA-mediated silencing
      complex. It associates with 22G-RNAs and interacts with RDE-12 (PMID:24684931)
      and ZNFX-1 (PMID:29775580) as part of the silencing machinery. RISC complex

  review:
    summary: This annotation is phylogenetically inferred from miRNA-binding Argonautes.
      However, WAGO-1 specifically binds 22G-RNAs (endogenous siRNAs), not miRNAs.
      The 22G-RNA pathway is distinct from the miRNA pathway in C. elegans. WAGO-1
      binds secondary siRNAs produced by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which are
      structurally and functionally distinct from miRNAs.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: WAGO-1 binds 22G-RNAs (endogenous siRNAs), not miRNAs. The miRNA binding
      annotation is an over-generalization from other Argonaute family members. The

    action: ACCEPT

      which is a child term already annotated.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a valid parent term for the more specific post-transcriptional
