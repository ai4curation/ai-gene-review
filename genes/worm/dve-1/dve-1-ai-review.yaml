description: DVE-1 is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor orthologous 
  to Drosophila defective proventriculus (Dve) and mammalian SATB family 
  proteins. It functions as a chromatin-associated regulator essential for the 
  mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR-mt). DVE-1 forms a complex with 
  UBL-5 and interacts with chromatin modifiers including HDA-1 (HDAC1/2 
  ortholog), the NuRD complex (via LIN-40), and histone methyltransferase MET-2.
  Upon mitochondrial stress, DVE-1 translocates from cytosol to nucleus where it
  binds promoters of mitochondrial chaperone genes (hsp-6, hsp-60) to enable 
  their transcriptional activation. SUMOylation at K327 regulates DVE-1 
  subcellular localization, with desumoylation by ULP-4 required for nuclear 
  accumulation. Beyond UPR-mt, DVE-1 regulates thousands of genes involved in 
  innate immunity, lipid metabolism, and longevity, often independently of the 
  canonical ATFS-1 pathway. Recent work reveals additional roles in 
  developmental synapse elimination in GABAergic neurons. DVE-1 is essential for
  embryonic development.

      summary: DVE-1 is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that 
        regulates RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of UPR-mt target 
        genes (hsp-6, hsp-60) and thousands of additional genes. The SATB-like 
        domain structure and experimental evidence from reporter assays support 
        this annotation.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The IBA annotation is well-supported by experimental evidence. 
        DVE-1 contains two homeobox DNA-binding domains (UniProt features) and 
        functions as a transcription factor that directly regulates gene 
        expression. PMID:17925224 demonstrates DVE-1 binds to promoters of 
        mitochondrial chaperone genes and is required for their transcriptional 
        activation. PMID:35021096 shows DVE-1 binds to the nhr-80 promoter to 
        transactivate its expression. The phylogenetic inference from SATB 
        family members is consistent with experimental findings.

      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: While DVE-1 does interact with LIN-40 (PMID:32789178), "protein 
        binding" is too generic and uninformative. The more specific annotation 
        GO:0044877 "protein-containing complex binding" from the same 
        publication better captures this interaction. GO guidelines recommend 
        avoiding generic "protein binding" when more specific terms apply.
