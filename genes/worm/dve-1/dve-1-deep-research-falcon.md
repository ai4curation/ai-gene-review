### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "dve-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'dve-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **dve-1** (gene ID: dve-1, UniProt: Q86MI0) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification
We verified the target as Caenorhabditis elegans dve-1, a homeodomain transcriptional regulator homologous to Drosophila defective proventriculus (Dve) and mammalian SATB family proteins. DVE-1 functions in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and additional programs affecting neuronal remodeling and longevity, consistent with a nuclear, chromatin-associated transcription factor. This matches the provided identity (UniProt Q86MI0; homeodomain/SATB-like features). Foundational primary sources in C. elegans confirm dve-1’s role in UPRmt and its interaction with UBL-5; more recent studies (2023–2024) uncover roles in synapse elimination and longevity that are partly independent of canonical UPRmt activation (haynes2007clppmediatesactivation pages 1-2, tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11, alexander2023thehomeodomaintranscriptional pages 2-4, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 8-10, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 10-11, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 6-8, haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 6-7).

Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- DVE-1: a C. elegans homeodomain transcriptional regulator, orthologous to Drosophila Dve/SATB-like proteins. It is essential (null lethal), acts at chromatin, and is required for robust induction of UPRmt genes upon mitochondrial stress (e.g., hsp-6/hsp-60 reporters). DVE-1 forms a complex with UBL-5 and cooperates with chromatin modifiers (LIN-65, MET-2) to enable stress-responsive transcription (Haynes et al., Dev Cell, 2007; Tian et al., Cell, 2016; Genetics review, 2022). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2007.07.016 (Oct 2007); https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.011 (May 2016); https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyac160 (Nov 2022) (haynes2007clppmediatesactivation pages 1-2, tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11, haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 6-7).
- UPRmt: a mitochondria-to-nucleus stress signaling pathway that induces mitochondrial chaperones/proteases and broader metabolic programs; in C. elegans, ATFS-1 and DVE-1/UBL-5 act in parallel/coordinate branches. ATFS-1 is normally imported into mitochondria and degraded, but under stress accumulates in the nucleus; DVE-1 operates at chromatin, enabling transcription in an ATFS-1–coordinated manner. Chromatin remodeling (e.g., JMJD demethylases, CBP-1 HAT, MET-2 H3K9me2, LIN-65) is required to open chromatin for DVE-1/ATFS-1 binding; DVE-1 and ATFS-1 activities are also modulated by SUMO/ULP-4 (Genetics 2022; Cell 2016). URLs: above; https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyac160 (Nov 2022) (haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 6-7, tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11).
- Cellular localization: DVE-1 is nuclear under stress and accumulates to promoters of UPRmt target genes; its nuclear localization and protein stability are interdependent with LIN-65 and depend on MET-2/H3K9me2 during stress (Cell 2016). Imaging of a DVE-1::GFP translational reporter confirms stress-induced nuclear localization; in certain ciliary mutants (daf-10), nuclear DVE-1 decreases while cytosolic puncta increase (Cell Reports 2024). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.011 (May 2016); https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114889 (Nov 2024) (tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 6-8).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- Neuronal circuit remodeling (Nature Communications 2023): DVE-1 directs synapse elimination during developmental remodeling of GABAergic DD motor neurons. Hypomorphic mutations in the DVE-1 homeodomain (e.g., uf171 P→S; tm4803 deleting helix III) cause persistent dorsal acetylcholine receptor clusters and apposing presynaptic sites that normally are removed by ~22 h after hatching, persisting into late L4 (>40 h). GABAergic cell-autonomous expression of wild-type dve-1 rescues the elimination defect; overexpression in wild type has little effect. Methods: forward genetic screen, WGS, confocal imaging, conditional AID depletion. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43281-4 (Nov 2023) (alexander2023thehomeodomaintranscriptional pages 2-4).
- Longevity regulation independent of canonical UPRmt (Cell Reports 2024): DVE-1 modulates lifespan in multiple contexts beyond classical UPRmt activation. Lifespan phenotypes show that dve-1(RNAi) can suppress or enhance longevity depending on background: it largely abolishes dietary restriction (eat-2) longevity and strongly suppresses germline-loss (glp-1) longevity, whereas in isp-1(qm150) mitochondrial mutants dve-1(RNAi) does not shorten and may further extend lifespan; in nuo-6 RNAi, atfs-1(RNAi) strongly suppresses mitoUPR while dve-1(RNAi) has little effect on mitoUPR readouts yet more potently reduces lifespan extension. Transcriptome analyses indicate DVE-1 regulates thousands of genes with minimal overlap with ATFS-1 at rest (3,177 vs 156; nine overlapping), shifting to more activator-like roles in certain long-lived backgrounds. Methods: targeted RNAi screening, lifespan assays, DVE-1::GFP imaging, RNA-seq reanalysis. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114889 (Nov 2024) (sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 8-10, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 10-11, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 6-8).
- Updated mechanistic context (Genetics 2022 review): DVE-1 binds chromatin with UBL-5 to facilitate ATFS-1–dependent transcription; desumoylation by ULP-4 enables DVE-1 DNA binding; chromatin opening by JMJD-1.2/JMJD-3.1 and CBP-1 precedes/permits DVE-1/ATFS-1 action. URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyac160 (Nov 2022) (haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 6-7).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Genetic reporters and stress assays: DVE-1 function is routinely monitored using UPRmt reporters (Phsp-6::GFP, Phsp-60::GFP) in genetic/chemical stress paradigms (e.g., spg-7 RNAi; ethidium bromide), providing practical readouts for mitochondrial proteostasis and for screening modulators of stress responses and longevity (Dev Cell 2007; Cell 2016). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2007.07.016 (Oct 2007); https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.011 (May 2016) (haynes2007clppmediatesactivation pages 1-2, tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11).
- Neuronal remodeling assays: The 2023 Nature Communications study establishes dve-1 as a lever for probing proteasome/ubiquitin–proteasome regulation in synapse elimination, with tools including neuron-specific expression/repression and AID-based acute depletion, supporting applications in circuit-development studies and screening (Nov 2023). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43281-4 (alexander2023thehomeodomaintranscriptional pages 2-4).
- Longevity modulation: The 2024 Cell Reports study indicates that targeting DVE-1 can tune lifespan across models (dietary restriction, germline-loss, mitochondrial mutants), often without canonical UPRmt activation, pointing to wider translational interest in chromatin and proteostasis pathways modulated by DVE-1 (Nov 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114889 (sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 8-10, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 10-11, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 6-8).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic synthesis (Genetics 2022): DVE-1 is a chromatin-associated factor that partners with UBL-5, with its activity controlled by SUMO/ULP-4 and upstream chromatin-remodeling enzymes (JMJD-1.2/JMJD-3.1; CBP-1). ATFS-1 alone is not sufficient for lifespan extension, suggesting UPRmt activation and longevity are not tightly coupled; DVE-1 adds a chromatin-based regulatory layer that contextualizes stress signaling (Nov 2022). URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyac160 (haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 6-7).
- Stress–chromatin interface (Cell 2016): DVE-1 and LIN-65 co-accumulate in nuclei under mitochondrial stress, with MET-2–dependent H3K9me2 changes coordinating chromatin reorganization for UPRmt and lifespan phenotypes, indicating DVE-1 functions within a chromatin-remodeling hub integrating mitochondrial cues (May 2016). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.011 (tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Transcriptome scope: DVE-1 regulates substantially more genes than ATFS-1 at baseline (dve-1 RNAi: 3,177 genes; atfs-1 RNAi: 156; nine overlapping). In long-lived backgrounds (e.g., daf-10, eat-2), DVE-1 shifts toward activator roles (e.g., 1,281 up/65 down in daf-10; 3,061/856 in eat-2), with strong overlap with ATFS-1-upregulated targets under those conditions (Cell Reports 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114889 (Nov 2024) (sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 10-11).
- Neuronal remodeling timing: In wild-type worms, dorsally localized juvenile iAChR clusters are eliminated by ~22 h post-hatch; in dve-1 hypomorphic mutants they persist beyond 40 h into late L4. Rescue by neuron-specific dve-1 confirms cell-autonomous requirement (Nature Communications 2023). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43281-4 (Nov 2023) (alexander2023thehomeodomaintranscriptional pages 2-4).
- Reporter specificity: dve-1(RNAi) reduces induction of mitochondrial UPR reporters (hsp-6/hsp-60) under mitochondrial stress (e.g., spg-7 RNAi, ethidium bromide), without affecting ER UPR reporter (hsp-4::GFP) induced by tunicamycin, indicating pathway specificity (Dev Cell 2007). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2007.07.016 (Oct 2007) (haynes2007clppmediatesactivation pages 1-2).
- Localization dependencies: Loss of met-2 reduces nuclear H3K9me2 and diminishes DVE-1/LIN-65 nuclear accumulation, lowering UPRmt induction and partially suppressing stress-triggered lifespan extension (Cell 2016). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.011 (May 2016) (tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11).

Functional annotation: mechanism, localization, pathways, partners, and methods
- Molecular function: DVE-1 is a nuclear transcriptional regulator acting at chromatin to facilitate UPRmt gene expression in cooperation with UBL-5 and chromatin modifiers; in other contexts it regulates extensive gene networks linked to proteostasis, immunity, GPCRs, and the ubiquitin–proteasome system. It likely functions as both repressor and activator depending on physiological context and genetic background (Cell Reports 2024; Genetics 2022; Cell 2016). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114889 (Nov 2024); https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyac160 (Nov 2022); https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.011 (May 2016) (sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 8-10, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 10-11, haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 6-7, tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11).
- Cellular localization: Predominantly nuclear under mitochondrial stress; nuclear accumulation interdependent with LIN-65 and sensitive to MET-2/H3K9me2 state. In certain noncanonical longevity contexts (e.g., daf-10), DVE-1 nuclear levels decrease while cytosolic puncta increase; deletion of a predicted NLS disperses DVE-1 but both WT and ΔNLS overexpression can extend lifespan, suggesting nuclear and extra-nuclear pools can contribute to organismal phenotypes (Cell 2016; Cell Reports 2024). URLs: as above (tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 6-8).
- Pathway membership: Canonical UPRmt branch with UBL-5, acting in parallel/coordination with ATFS-1, downstream of mitochondrial proteostasis perturbations (e.g., CLPP-1/ClpP activity). DVE-1 is required for induction of mitochondrial chaperones/proteases (hsp-6/hsp-60). Chromatin remodeling is an upstream permissive layer (Dev Cell 2007; Cell 2016; Genetics 2022). URLs: above (haynes2007clppmediatesactivation pages 1-2, tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11, haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 6-7).
- Key partners: UBL-5 (complex with DVE-1), LIN-65 and MET-2 (chromatin reorganization/nuclear localization), ATFS-1 (parallel transcriptional regulator), with regulation by SUMO/ULP-4 and histone modifiers (JMJD-1.2/JMJD-3.1; CBP-1) (Genetics 2022; Dev Cell 2007; Cell 2016). URLs: above (haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 6-7, haynes2007clppmediatesactivation pages 1-2, tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11).
- DNA recognition: DVE-1 binds chromatin at UPRmt gene promoters, but no single short consensus DNA motif is firmly established in the cited experimental excerpts; its SATB-like homology suggests roles as a genome organizer influencing accessibility and promoter architecture (Cell 2016; Genetics 2022). URLs: above (tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11, haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 6-7).
- Methods establishing function: genome-scale and targeted RNAi screens; hsp-6/hsp-60 reporter assays; confocal imaging of DVE-1::GFP; lifespan assays across genetic/physiological backgrounds; forward genetic identification of homeodomain mutations; conditional AID depletion; RNA-seq reanalyses (Dev Cell 2007; Cell 2016; Nat Commun 2023; Cell Reports 2024). URLs: above (haynes2007clppmediatesactivation pages 1-2, tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11, alexander2023thehomeodomaintranscriptional pages 2-4, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 8-10, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 10-11, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 6-8).

Conclusions
DVE-1 (Q86MI0) is the C. elegans homeodomain/SATB-like transcriptional regulator that integrates mitochondrial stress with nuclear gene expression via chromatin reorganization. In canonical UPRmt, DVE-1 forms a complex with UBL-5 and cooperates with chromatin modifiers and ATFS-1 to induce mitochondrial chaperones/proteases; its nuclear accumulation is a hallmark of mitochondrial stress. Recent studies show DVE-1 also directs synapse elimination during neuronal remodeling and modulates longevity across diverse physiological states, often decoupled from canonical UPRmt reporter activation. These findings position DVE-1 as a chromatin-embedded hub that tunes proteostasis, neuronal development, and organismal lifespan in a context-dependent manner (haynes2007clppmediatesactivation pages 1-2, tian2016mitochondrialstressinduces pages 9-11, alexander2023thehomeodomaintranscriptional pages 2-4, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 8-10, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 10-11, sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 6-8, haynes2022mitochondrialdysfunctionaging pages 6-7).
