## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q23536
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Protein lgg-2;
- **Gene Information:** Name=lgg-2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:ZK593.6a}; ORFNames=ZK593.6 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:ZK593.6a};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ATG8 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Atg8-like. (IPR004241); Ubiquitin-like_domsf. (IPR029071); ATG8 (PF02991)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "lgg-2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'lgg-2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **lgg-2** (gene ID: lgg-2, UniProt: Q23536) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan summary
- Verified identity: lgg-2 encodes the Caenorhabditis elegans LC3-type Atg8-family protein (UniProt Q23536), a ubiquitin-like protein with a conserved LC3/Atg8 fold and LIR-docking sites. It functions alongside LGG-1 (GABARAP-like) in autophagy and related processes. This aligns with the UniProt description (ATG8 family, ubiquitin-like domains) and the organismal context is C. elegans (no symbol ambiguity detected in the cited literature) (manilsegalen2014thec.elegans pages 2-3, wu2015structuralbasisof pages 4-6, jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 1-5).

Comprehensive research report on lgg-2 (C. elegans; UniProt Q23536)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Protein/gene identity and family: LGG-2 is one of two C. elegans Atg8 homologs; LGG-2 clusters with the LC3 subfamily, while LGG-1 clusters with the GABARAP subfamily. Both decorate autophagosomal membranes and drive autophagy, but with distinct, sequential roles (Developmental Cell, Jan 2014; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2013.11.022) (manilsegalen2014thec.elegans pages 2-3).
- Structural features and LIR binding: LGG-2 adopts the conserved Atg8 ubiquitin-like fold and recognizes LC3-interacting region (LIR/AIM) motifs through canonical W- and L-site hydrophobic pockets. Crystal structures revealed LGG-2’s W-site (e.g., Ile33, Pro42, Lys61, Leu63, Phe118) and L-site (e.g., Phe62, Val64, Ile68, Leu73, Ile76, Arg80) that engage LIR peptides; LGG-2’s N-terminus adopts the open (O-form) characteristic of LC3s (Molecular Cell, Dec 17, 2015; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.11.019) (wu2015structuralbasisof pages 4-6).
- Lipidation and membrane association: Like other Atg8s, LGG-2 is synthesized as a precursor, cleaved to expose a C-terminal glycine, and conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by the ATG7–ATG3 machinery. Mutating the invariant glycine (G130A in LGG-2) abolishes membrane puncta, yielding diffuse reporter signal, demonstrating lipidation is required for membrane association in vivo (Autophagy, Sep 2019; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2018.1512452; eLife, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72466) (jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 21-23, penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 5-7).

2) Molecular function, pathways, and positioning relative to LGG-1
- Sequential roles in autophagy: LGG-1 (GABARAP-like) acts upstream, and LGG-2 (LC3-like) acts downstream to promote autophagic flux. LGG-2 enables autophagosome degradation by interacting with the HOPS tethering complex subunit VPS39, placing LGG-2 at the autophagosome–lysosome fusion/maturation step (Developmental Cell, Jan 2014; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2013.11.022) (manilsegalen2014thec.elegans pages 2-3).
- Selective autophagy and cargo context: Genetic and imaging analyses show cargo- and stage-specific requirements for LGG-2 versus LGG-1. For example, p62/SQST-1::GFP aggregates and other cargo reporters show distinct dependencies across larval stages and tissues, indicating that LGG-2 can be dispensable for certain cargo in early stages but contributes in later or different contexts, consistent with subfamily-specific selectivity (Molecular Cell, Dec 17, 2015; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.11.019) (wu2015structuralbasisof pages 4-6).
- LAP vs canonical autophagy during apoptotic cell clearance: In C. elegans embryos, LGG-2 participates in the clearance of apoptotic cells, functioning predominantly in phagocytic cells during phagosome maturation/degradation. Both LGG-1 and LGG-2 localizations and functions in this context require canonical autophagy genes (UNC-51/ULK1, BEC-1/BECN1, ATG7), which is unlike mammalian ULK-independent LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), supporting the involvement of canonical autophagosomes in corpse clearance (Autophagy, Sep 2019; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2018.1512452) (jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 1-5).
- Autophagosome–phagosome crosstalk: Live imaging shows LGG-2+ autophagosomes are recruited to and fuse with phagosomes containing apoptotic corpses, delivering the inner vesicle into the phagosomal lumen and aiding degradation. This indicates canonical double-membrane autophagosomes, not single-membrane LAP vesicles, facilitate phagosome maturation in C. elegans (eLife, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72466) (penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 5-7, penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 11-14).

3) Subcellular localization and dynamics
- Autophagosomes: LGG-2 localizes to punctate, vesicular structures that correspond to double-membrane autophagosomes by EM/immunogold; these puncta require ATG7-mediated lipidation (Developmental Cell, Jan 2014; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2013.11.022; eLife, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72466) (manilsegalen2014thec.elegans pages 2-3, penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 5-7).
- Phagosomes during apoptosis: In embryos, GFP::LGG-2 forms a peripheral, discontinuous ring on phagosomes around apoptotic cells; fluorescence later appears within the lumen after fusion, consistent with autophagosome-phagosome fusion dynamics. Lipidation-defective LGG-2(G130A) remains diffuse and fails to form rings (Autophagy, Sep 2019; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2018.1512452) (jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 21-23, jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 7-10).

4) Phenotypes upon perturbation of lgg-2
- Autophagic flux and development: A deletion allele lgg-2(tm5755) lacks obvious gross developmental defects on its own, but LGG-1 and LGG-2 act synergistically; combined perturbation enhances embryonic defects, consistent with partially redundant/serial functions in autophagy (Developmental Cell, Jan 2014; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2013.11.022) (manilsegalen2014thec.elegans pages 2-3).
- Apoptotic corpse clearance: lgg-2 mutants show delayed degradation of engulfed apoptotic corpses (increased persistence of phagosomes/corpses), whereas the timing of engulfment onset is less affected; double lgg-1; lgg-2 mutants give stronger Ced phenotypes, indicating both contribute to efficient clearance but at different steps (Autophagy, Sep 2019; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2018.1512452; eLife, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72466) (jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 7-10, penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 11-14).

5) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Reporter usage: GFP::LGG-2, mCherry::LGG-2, and mNeonGreen::LGG-2 reporters are widely used to visualize autophagosomes and their dynamics. In phagosome studies, pH-stable red/green reporters allow detection of reporter entry into the acidic phagosomal lumen after fusion, validating fusion events and double-membrane topology (eLife, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72466). Lipidation-site mutants (LGG-2 G130A) serve as controls to confirm puncta arise from PE conjugation (Autophagy, Sep 2019; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2018.1512452) (penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 5-7, jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 21-23).
- Autophagosome–phagosome crosstalk assays: Real-time imaging of LGG-2 reporters on phagosomes, combined with autophagy mutants (e.g., atg-7, atg-13, epg-8, atg-9), quantitatively tracks recruitment, fusion, and maturation defects (eLife, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72466) (penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 5-7, penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 11-14).

6) Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- The C. elegans field recognizes two Atg8 homologs with subfamily-specific functions. Consensus from structural and genetic work is that LGG-2 is the LC3-like factor acting later than LGG-1 in autophagic flux and promoting degradation steps via tethering/fusion machinery (HOPS/VPS39), while also playing a defined role in apoptotic corpse processing within phagocytic cells (Developmental Cell, Jan 2014; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2013.11.022; Autophagy, Sep 2019; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2018.1512452) (manilsegalen2014thec.elegans pages 2-3, jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 1-5).

7) Recent developments and latest research (prioritized 2022 and notes on 2023–2024)
- 2022 update: High-resolution live imaging demonstrated that LGG-2+ autophagosomes are recruited to and fuse with phagosomes in vivo, providing strong evidence that canonical autophagosomes (not LAP vesicles) facilitate apoptotic corpse degradation in C. elegans (eLife, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72466) (penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 5-7, penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 11-14).
- 2023–2024: In the evidence retrieved here, no LGG-2-specific primary study from 2023–2024 was captured. The most recent, directly relevant mechanistic advance for LGG-2 in C. elegans phagosome maturation remains the 2022 eLife study cited above. Earlier foundational work (2014–2019) establishes LGG-2’s LC3-like identity, structural basis for LIR interactions, and downstream fusion/maturation role with HOPS/VPS39 (manilsegalen2014thec.elegans pages 2-3, wu2015structuralbasisof pages 4-6, jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 1-5). If needed, broader Atg8/LC3 reviews from 2023 can contextualize conserved interaction modes, but LGG-2-specific new data were not identified in this evidence set (wu2015structuralbasisof pages 4-6, manilsegalen2014thec.elegans pages 2-3, penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 5-7).

8) Relevant statistics and data (from recent studies)
- Localization dependency on lipidation: LGG-2(G130A) mutants lose puncta/ring structures and show diffuse signal in embryos clearing apoptotic cells, indicating lipidation is necessary for membrane targeting (Autophagy, Sep 2019; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2018.1512452) (jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 21-23).
- Phagosome maturation timing: In lgg-2 or autophagy mutants (e.g., atg-7), phagosomes persist longer (prolonged lifespans) despite normal engulfment timing, pinpointing LGG-2’s role in maturation/degradation rather than engulfment initiation (eLife, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72466) (penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 11-14).
- Autophagosome populations: Distinct LGG-1+ and LGG-2+ puncta, and double-positive subsets, decorate phagosome surfaces, reflecting maturation-stage heterogeneity of autophagosomes engaging with phagosomes (eLife, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72466) (penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 11-14).

Interpretive synthesis
- Primary function: LGG-2 is a membrane-conjugated LC3-type autophagy factor that binds LIR/AIM-containing partners and promotes autophagosome maturation and degradation steps. In vivo, its most clearly defined role in C. elegans is to promote phagosome maturation during apoptotic corpse clearance by recruiting/fusing canonical autophagosomes to phagosomes, acting downstream of LGG-1/GABARAP and engaging tethering/fusion machinery such as HOPS/VPS39 (manilsegalen2014thec.elegans pages 2-3, penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 5-7, penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 11-14).
- Subcellular site of action: LGG-2 acts on autophagosomal membranes and at the phagosomal surface in phagocytic cells; its lipidation-dependent puncta and phagosomal rings reflect membrane association and fusion intermediates (jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 21-23, jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 7-10, manilsegalen2014thec.elegans pages 2-3).
- Pathways: LGG-2 participates in canonical autophagy (ULK/BEC-1/ATG7-dependent) and in autophagosome–phagosome crosstalk for apoptotic corpse degradation. It functions later than LGG-1 and contributes to tethering/fusion with lysosomal machinery via VPS39/HOPS (jenzer2019autophagymediatesphosphatidylserine pages 1-5, manilsegalen2014thec.elegans pages 2-3, penaramos2022autophagosomesfuseto pages 5-7).
