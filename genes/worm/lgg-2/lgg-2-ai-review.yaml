description: LGG-2 is an LC3-type ATG8 family protein that functions as a 
  ubiquitin-like modifier in autophagy in C. elegans. Unlike its paralog LGG-1 
  (GABARAP-type), LGG-2 acts downstream in the autophagy pathway, primarily 
  promoting autophagosome maturation and autophagosome-lysosome fusion through 
  direct interaction with the HOPS complex subunit VPS-39. LGG-2 is lipidated 
  (conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine) at its C-terminal glycine residue, 
  which is essential for membrane association and autophagosome localization. 
  LGG-2 recognizes LIR (LC3-interacting region) motifs in cargo receptors such 
  as SQST-1 and SEPA-1. The protein plays roles in multiple selective autophagy 
  pathways including aggrephagy (degradation of protein aggregates), allophagy 
  (degradation of paternal mitochondria during fertilization), xenophagy 
  (degradation of bacterial toxins), and contributes to apoptotic corpse 
  clearance by facilitating autophagosome-phagosome fusion. LGG-1 and LGG-2 have
  partially overlapping but distinct functions, with LGG-1 acting upstream to 
  allow LGG-2 localization to autophagosomes, and LGG-2 acting downstream to 
  promote degradation steps.

  review:
    summary: LGG-2 is recruited to nascent autophagosomes and plays a role in 
      autophagosome biogenesis, though its primary function is downstream in 
      maturation rather than initial assembly. The IBA annotation is 
      phylogenetically sound as ATG8 family members are conserved in this 
      function (PMID:24374177).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: ATG8 family proteins including LGG-2 are conjugated to 
      autophagosomal membranes during autophagosome formation. While LGG-2 
      functions primarily downstream in maturation, it is still involved in the 
      autophagosome assembly process as demonstrated by its localization to 
      autophagosomes and requirement for autophagic flux. The IBA annotation 
      based on phylogeny is appropriate.

      well-characterized function for C. elegans LGG-2.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While mammalian LC3 proteins were named for their association with 
      microtubule-associated proteins, the primary characterized function of 
      LGG-2 in C. elegans is in autophagy, not microtubule binding. There is no 
      direct experimental evidence for LGG-2 microtubule binding in C. elegans. 
      This annotation represents a potential over-extension of the mammalian LC3

      mechanism rather than a specific anti-Gram-positive function. The 
      annotation is valid but represents a downstream consequence of autophagy 
      induction by infection, not a core molecular function.

  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:24374177
  review:
    summary: Direct experimental evidence shows LGG-2 localizes to autophagosome
      membranes, forming punctate structures in embryos (PMID:24374177).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IDA evidence directly demonstrates LGG-2 localization to 
      autophagosome membranes through fluorescent reporter imaging. Localization
      requires ATG-7-dependent lipidation.

  review:
    summary: LGG-2 shows cytoplasmic localization in addition to autophagosomal 
      puncta (PMID:20523114).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IDA evidence confirms cytoplasmic localization of LGG-2, 
      particularly the non-lipidated pool.

    label: autophagosome-lysosome fusion
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:24374177
  review:
    summary: LGG-2 promotes autophagosome-lysosome fusion through interaction 
      with VPS-39 of the HOPS tethering complex. This is a core function that 
      distinguishes LGG-2 from LGG-1 (PMID:24374177).
    action: NEW
    reason: This term precisely captures LGG-2's primary molecular role in 
      promoting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. The evidence shows LGG-2 
      interacts with VPS-39/HOPS to tether autophagosomes to lysosomes.

        LGG-1, LGG-2, RAB-7, and HOPS complex to generate autolysosomes.

      supporting_text: LGG-2 controls the maturation of LGG-1-positive 
        autophagosomes and facilitates the tethering with the lysosomes through 
        a direct interaction with the VPS-39 HOPS complex subunit.
