description: CAR-1 (Cytokinesis, Apoptosis, RNA-associated) is the C. elegans ortholog
  of LSM14/Scd6 family proteins. It contains an N-terminal atypical Sm domain that
  directly binds RNA, central DFDF/FFD/TFG motifs, and a C-terminal RGG box. CAR-1
  is a key component of both P-bodies (cytoplasmic mRNA processing bodies) and P granules
  (germline-specific ribonucleoprotein particles). It forms an RNA-dependent complex
  with the DEAD-box RNA helicase CGH-1 (DDX6 ortholog) and the Y-box protein CEY-2,
  functioning in post-transcriptional regulation of maternally loaded mRNAs. CAR-1
  is essential for embryonic cytokinesis, where it is required for formation of interzonal
  microtubule bundles during anaphase. It also regulates physiological germline apoptosis,
  with car-1 depletion leading to increased germ cell death. The protein localizes
  dynamically to P granules that concentrate in germline precursors and to smaller
  cytoplasmic P-body particles present in all cells of early embryos.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CAR-1 is a well-established P-body component. Multiple IDA annotations
      support P-body localization (PMID:16267265, PMID:18515547, PMID:24367695). CAR-1
      colocalizes with DCAP-1, the mRNA decapping component, in cytoplasmic foci that
      are characteristic of P-bodies (PMID:16267265).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IBA annotation is fully supported by experimental evidence. CAR-1 localizes
      with the mRNA decapping component DCAP-1 (PMID:16267265) and localizes to germline
      P bodies (PMID:18515547). P-body localization is central to CAR-1 function.

    label: mRNA binding
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CAR-1 contains an atypical Sm domain at its N-terminus that directly
      binds RNA. The Sm domain and RGG box both bind to poly(U)-sepharose beads in
      vitro (PMID:16247027). The Sm domain is essential for CAR-1 function but not
      localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IBA annotation is well-supported. CAR-1 is a predicted RNA-binding protein
      with demonstrated RNA binding activity. The annotation is appropriately specific
      as CAR-1 functions in mRNA metabolism through P-body and P-granule complexes.

    label: P-body assembly
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CAR-1 is a core P-body component, but evidence suggests CGH-1 controls
      CAR-1 localization and P-body/particle formation rather than CAR-1 driving assembly.
      In cgh-1 mutants, CAR-1 forms aberrant bar-like structures (PMID:16247027, PMID:24367695).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IBA annotation is reasonable given CAR-1's conserved role as a P-body
      component. While CGH-1 appears more upstream in controlling particle assembly,
      CAR-1 is required for proper P-body function and its depletion affects RNP organization.

    label: stress granule assembly
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: While CAR-1 is a known component of RNP granules that share features
      with stress granules, direct evidence for CAR-1 involvement in stress granule
      assembly in C. elegans is limited. The annotation is based on phylogenetic inference
      from yeast Scd6 and other orthologs.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation is derived from phylogenetic inference. In C. elegans,
      stress granules and P-bodies colocalize and share components (PMID:24367695),
      but the primary characterized roles of CAR-1 are in P-body/P-granule function,
      cytokinesis, and apoptosis regulation rather than stress response.

    label: RNA binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation is consistent with experimental evidence. CAR-1 contains
      Sm domain and RGG box that bind RNA. The more specific mRNA binding (GO:0003729)
      annotation exists via IBA.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IEA annotation is valid and supported by experimental evidence demonstrating
      CAR-1 RNA binding via its Sm domain and RGG box (PMID:16247027). The annotation
      is appropriately general as a parent term to mRNA binding.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: UniProt annotation indicates nuclear localization based on PMID:18430416,
      which identified CAR-1 as a transcriptional regulator that binds the cdc-48.1
      promoter. However, the predominant localization of CAR-1 in other studies is
      cytoplasmic (P-bodies and P-granules).
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Nuclear localization appears to be a minor or context-specific aspect
      of CAR-1 function. The primary and well-characterized localizations are to cytoplasmic
      P-bodies and P-granules. The transcriptional regulator function in PMID:18430416
      is atypical compared to other CAR-1 studies.

    label: spliceosomal complex
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on UniProt keyword mapping. While CAR-1 contains
      an Sm domain related to spliceosomal Sm proteins, CAR-1 itself has an atypical
      Sm domain and functions in P-body/mRNA metabolism rather than splicing.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation is misleading. CAR-1 contains an atypical Sm domain that
      is distinct from canonical spliceosomal Sm domains (PMID:16247027). CAR-1 functions
      in mRNA metabolism and cytokinesis, not pre-mRNA splicing. The sequence divergence
      within the Sm domain is predicted to confer unique RNA binding properties to
      this protein family distinct from spliceosomal Sm proteins.

  review:
    summary: Cytoplasmic localization is well-supported by multiple experimental studies.
      CAR-1 localizes to cytoplasmic P-bodies and P-granules.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IEA annotation is correct and redundant with multiple IDA annotations
      for cytoplasm localization (PMID:16221731, PMID:16267265). CAR-1 is a cytoplasmic
      protein that localizes to RNP granules.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on UniProt keyword mapping from the transcription
      regulator function described in PMID:18430416. However, CAR-1's primary characterized
      function is post-transcriptional mRNA regulation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While PMID:18430416 provides evidence for CAR-1 involvement in transcriptional
      regulation of cdc-48.1, this appears to be a secondary or specialized function.
      The preponderance of evidence supports CAR-1's primary role in post-transcriptional
      regulation through P-body/P-granule function.

    summary: CAR-1 functions in mRNA metabolism through P-bodies, which are sites
      of mRNA storage and degradation. CAR-1 colocalizes with DCAP-1, the decapping
      enzyme.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IEA annotation is appropriate. CAR-1 is involved in post-transcriptional
      mRNA regulation as a P-body component. It functions with CGH-1 to regulate maternally
      loaded mRNAs required for cytokinesis (PMID:16247027).

  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on UniProt keyword mapping, likely from the
      Sm domain. However, CAR-1 has an atypical Sm domain and functions in mRNA metabolism,
      not pre-mRNA splicing.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation is incorrect. CAR-1's atypical Sm domain is functionally
      distinct from canonical spliceosomal Sm proteins. CAR-1 functions in P-body-mediated
      mRNA regulation and cytokinesis, not RNA splicing. There is no experimental
      evidence supporting CAR-1 involvement in splicing.

  original_reference_id: PMID:25261697
  review:
    summary: CAR-1 is a component of OMA ribonucleoprotein particles that regulate
      translation during oogenesis. CAR-1 was identified as an OMA-1-associated protein
      in affinity purification experiments.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IDA annotation is well-supported. CAR-1 localizes to multiple types of
      RNP granules including P-bodies, P-granules, and OMA RNPs. This annotation captures
      the general RNP granule localization.

    label: RNA polymerase II core promoter sequence-specific DNA binding
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:18430416
  review:
    summary: PMID:18430416 identified CAR-1 as binding to Element B in the cdc-48.1
      promoter using South-Western blotting from embryonic nuclear extracts. However,
      this is an unusual function for CAR-1 compared to its well-characterized cytoplasmic
      RNA metabolism functions.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: The annotation is based on South-Western blotting which identifies proteins
      that bind DNA, but this method may not distinguish direct from indirect binding.
      This finding has not been replicated and is inconsistent with CAR-1's primary
      characterization as a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein. Further evidence would
      be needed to confirm this atypical function.

    label: positive regulation of gene expression
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:18430416
  review:
    summary: car-1(RNAi) reduces cdc-48.1 expression, supporting a positive regulatory
      role. However, this may be indirect through mRNA stabilization rather than transcriptional
      activation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The annotation reflects a phenotypic observation. Given CAR-1's primary
      role in mRNA metabolism, the effect on gene expression may be at the post-transcriptional
      level (mRNA stability/translation) rather than transcriptional activation. The
      term is broad enough to encompass both possibilities.

  review:
    summary: PMID:16267265 reports CAR-1 affects ER organization, but the primary
      localization data in this paper focuses on P-bodies, P-granules, spindle, and
      pericentriolar material. ER localization may be indirect or context-specific.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The paper describes organization of the endoplasmic reticulum is aberrant
      upon CAR-1 depletion, suggesting CAR-1 affects ER organization. However, ER
      localization is not a primary characterized site for CAR-1. The relationship
      may be functional rather than direct localization.

  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:16267265
  review:
    summary: CAR-1 is required for proper anaphase spindle structure. CAR-1 depletion
      causes failure of interzonal microtubule bundle formation. The localization
      to spindle may be related to CAR-1's function in regulating mRNAs required for
      spindle assembly.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IDA annotation is supported by functional evidence. CAR-1 depletion causes
      a specific defect in the microtubule cytoskeleton with loss of interzonal microtubule
      bundles (PMID:16247027). This suggests CAR-1 localizes to or functions at the
      spindle during cytokinesis.

      the spindle midzone fails to form, even though midzone components are present
      (PMID:16267265).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IDA annotation is well-supported. CAR-1 depletion causes failure of interzonal
      microtubule bundle formation and loss of AIR-2 and ZEN-4 recruitment to the
      midzone (PMID:16247027). CAR-1 function is essential for midzone assembly.

      CAR-1 also forms complexes with CGH-1 and CEY-2 (PMID:16247027).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term protein binding is too vague and uninformative. CAR-1 has specific,

suggested_questions:
- question: Is CAR-1's role in transcriptional regulation of cdc-48.1 (PMID:18430416)
    a true transcriptional function or an indirect effect through mRNA regulation?
- question: What specific mRNAs does CAR-1 regulate to control cytokinesis and anaphase
    spindle structure?
- question: Does CAR-1 play a direct role in piRNA silencing pathways as suggested
    by some studies of CAR-1/CGH-1 function?
suggested_experiments:
- description: CLIP-seq or RIP-seq to identify direct CAR-1 mRNA targets in embryos
    and germline.
- description: Determine whether CAR-1's effect on cdc-48.1 expression is at the transcriptional
    or post-transcriptional level.
- description: Characterize the specific mRNAs regulated by CAR-1 that are required
    for interzonal microtubule bundle formation.
