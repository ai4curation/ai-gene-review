description: ZNFX-1 is a conserved NFX1-type zinc finger-containing RNA helicase that
  is the defining component of Z granules, a class of liquid-like condensates distinct
  from P granules. ZNFX-1 functions as a dedicated transgenerational RNAi inheritance
  factor, required for transmitting small RNA-mediated gene silencing signals across
  generations. The protein localizes to perinuclear nuage where it interacts with
  Argonaute proteins (WAGO-4, CSR-1, WAGO-1, PRG-1) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
  EGO-1. ZNFX-1 and WAGO-4 co-localize in P granules during early germline development,
  then segregate to form Z granules during oocyte maturation. In adult germ cells,
  P granules, Z granules, and Mutator foci assemble into ordered tri-condensate "PZM"
  assemblages. ZNFX-1's helicase activity is essential for balancing epigenetic signals
  by preventing the spread of small RNA targeting toward the 5'-end of mRNAs, thereby
  maintaining stable transgenerational silencing.

  review:
    summary: ZNFX-1 contains NF-X1 type zinc finger domains and functions within RNA/protein
      granules (Z granules). The protein interacts with Argonaute proteins (CSR-1,
      WAGO-1, WAGO-4, PRG-1) and the RdRP EGO-1, all of which are RNA-binding proteins
      involved in small RNA pathways [PMID:29775580, PMID:29769721]. RNA binding is
      consistent with its role in RNA helicase activity and small RNA-mediated gene
      silencing.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'RNA binding is a core function supported by multiple lines of evidence:
      the protein contains NFX1-type zinc finger domains (4 copies), localizes to

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This annotation is inferred from S. pombe ortholog hrr1 (SPCC1739.03).
      While ZNFX-1 is involved in regulatory ncRNA-mediated gene silencing, its primary
      function in C. elegans appears to be cytoplasmic post-transcriptional silencing
      rather than heterochromatin formation. The key role of ZNFX-1 is transgenerational
      siRNA inheritance via cytoplasmic Z granules, not nuclear heterochromatin assembly.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While the S. pombe ortholog hrr1 functions in heterochromatin formation,
      C. elegans ZNFX-1 functions primarily in cytoplasmic transgenerational RNAi
      inheritance. The term is too specific to the nuclear heterochromatin pathway.
      A more appropriate term would reflect its role in siRNA-mediated gene silencing.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is inferred from S. pombe ortholog hrr1. However, in
      C. elegans, ZNFX-1 does not localize to the nucleus but rather to cytoplasmic
      perinuclear granules (Z granules). While ZNFX-1 interacts with the RdRP EGO-1,
      this interaction occurs in cytoplasmic nuage, not in a nuclear complex. The
      primary localization of ZNFX-1 is to Z granules adjacent to P granules in the
      perinuclear region.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: UniProt explicitly states ZNFX-1 localizes to "Cytoplasm, perinuclear
      region" and "Cytoplasmic granule" (Z granules). There is no evidence for nuclear
      localization in C. elegans. The S. pombe ortholog hrr1 has a distinct nuclear
      function that does not apply to the C. elegans protein.

- description: ZNFX-1 functions as an RNA helicase dedicated to transgenerational
    siRNA inheritance, maintaining small RNA-mediated gene silencing signals across
    generations.

    supporting_text: The data establish that ZNFX-1 is a dedicated RNAi inheritance
      factor
  - reference_id: PMID:29775580
    supporting_text: we identify the deeply conserved helicase-domain protein, ZNFX-1,
      as an epigenetic regulator and component of nuage that interacts with Argonaute
      systems to balance epigenetic inheritance
proposed_new_terms: []
suggested_questions:
- question: What is the precise mechanism by which ZNFX-1 helicase activity prevents
    5'-ward spread of small RNA signals on target mRNAs?
- question: How is ZNFX-1 inherited from oocyte to embryo, and what determines Z granule
    segregation from P granules during development?
suggested_experiments:
- description: In vitro helicase assays with purified ZNFX-1 to determine substrate
    specificity (ssRNA vs dsRNA, specific RNA sequences). This would reveal the molecular
    substrate requirements for ZNFX-1 function.
  hypothesis: ZNFX-1 preferentially unwinds specific RNA structures involved in siRNA
    biogenesis
  experiment_type: biochemical assay
- description: Proximity labeling (BioID or APEX) to comprehensively identify ZNFX-1
    interacting proteins in Z granules vs P granules. This would reveal the complete
    protein composition of Z granules and how it differs from P granules.
  hypothesis: Z granules contain a distinct proteome specialized for transgenerational
    inheritance
