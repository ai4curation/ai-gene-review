description: MUT-16 is a glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich scaffold protein essential
  for the formation of Mutator foci, perinuclear phase-separated condensates that
  serve as sites for siRNA amplification in the C. elegans germline. MUT-16 nucleates
  the assembly of the mutator complex, recruiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RRF-1
  and other mutator proteins to form a specialized RNA processing compartment. Through
  its scaffold function, MUT-16 is required for RNA interference (RNAi) and the silencing
  of more than 2,000 endogenous genes, including transposable elements. Mutator foci
  are adjacent to, but distinct from, P granules, and both represent key germline
  RNA regulatory compartments.

  review:
    summary: MUT-16 localizes to punctate foci at the periphery of germline nuclei,
      termed Mutator foci (PMID:22713602). This is the defining paper that characterized
      Mutator foci as a distinct subcellular compartment. MUT-16 is not merely a component
      but is specifically required for the formation of Mutator foci - in its absence,
      these foci fail to form.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core annotation supported by direct experimental evidence. PMID:22713602
      demonstrates that MUT-16 localizes to Mutator foci using fluorescent protein
      tagging and microscopy. The paper establishes that MUT-16 is essential for Mutator
      foci formation, making this localization annotation highly accurate.

  review:
    summary: PMID:24684932 confirms MUT-16 localization to Mutator foci and its role
      in nucleating the mutator complex. The study demonstrates that MUT-16 is the
      scaffold for the mutator complex that silences more than 2,000 C. elegans genes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is well-supported. PMID:24684932 provides additional evidence

    summary: PMID:32338603 further characterizes Mutator foci as phase-separated condensates
      and confirms MUT-16 localization. This study identifies SIMR-1 foci as distinct
      from but adjacent to both P granules and Mutator foci.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Provides additional confirmation of MUT-16 localization to Mutator foci
      and adds the important characterization that these are phase-separated condensates,

  review:
    summary: This is a placeholder annotation indicating no specific molecular function
      has been assigned. However, based on current literature, MUT-16 functions as
      a molecular condensate scaffold that nucleates assembly of the mutator complex.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: MUT-16 has a well-characterized molecular function as a scaffold protein
      that brings together components of the mutator complex through its Q/N-rich
      intrinsically disordered regions, promoting phase separation and complex assembly.
      This function is analogous to molecular condensate scaffold activity.

  review:
    summary: MUT-16 is required for siRNA amplification. Genes with high siRNA levels
      (indicative of multiple amplification rounds) are disproportionally affected
      in mut-16 mutants. RdRP RRF-1 colocalizes with MUT-16 at Mutator foci.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The GO term siRNA processing includes siRNA amplification by RNA-dependent
      RNA polymerase according to the term definition. PMID:22713602 provides strong
      evidence that MUT-16 is required for this process, with mutants showing disproportionate

  review:
    summary: PMID:12906791 was an early genome-wide screen that identified mut-16
      as required for transposon silencing. The nuclear localization annotation may
      be imprecise - Mutator foci are actually in the perinuclear cytoplasm, adjacent
      to the nuclear envelope, not within the nucleus.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Later studies (PMID:22713602) clearly established that MUT-16 localizes
      to perinuclear Mutator foci in the germline cytoplasm, adjacent to P granules.
      These foci are at the nuclear periphery but in the cytoplasm, not inside the
      nucleus. The more precise annotation is to mutator focus (GO:1990633).

  review:
    summary: MUT-16 is indeed cytoplasmic, specifically in perinuclear Mutator foci.
      While technically correct, this annotation is too general given the specific
      localization to Mutator foci that is now well-established.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The cytoplasm annotation is technically correct since Mutator foci are
      cytoplasmic structures at the nuclear periphery. However, it is less informative
      than the mutator focus annotation (GO:1990633) which captures the specific subcellular
      localization.

  review:
    summary: PMID:12906791 identified mut-16 in a genome-wide screen for genes involved
      in transposon silencing, demonstrating a role in gene silencing. MUT-16 is required
      for the mutator pathway that produces secondary siRNAs for post-transcriptional
      gene silencing.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core function of MUT-16. The mutator complex synthesizes secondary
      siRNAs (22G-RNAs) that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing of transposons
      and other endogenous targets. PMID:12906791 demonstrates mut-16 mutants have
      defective transposon silencing, and later work confirms this is through the
      siRNA pathway.
