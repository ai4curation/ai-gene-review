description: PEK-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian PERK (PKR-like ER 
  kinase), a type I transmembrane serine/threonine kinase residing in the ER 
  membrane. Upon ER stress caused by accumulation of unfolded proteins, PEK-1 
  phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2
  (eIF2alpha) at Ser49, leading to global attenuation of translation while 
  allowing selective translation of stress-responsive mRNAs. PEK-1 is a critical
  component of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and acts in complementary 
  pathways with IRE-1/XBP-1 and ATF-6 to maintain ER homeostasis. Single pek-1 
  mutants are viable but sensitized to ER stress; combined loss of pek-1 with 
  ire-1/xbp-1 or atf-6 causes larval arrest, demonstrating essential redundancy.
  PEK-1 also protects against replication stress-induced DNA damage and 
  functions in neuron-specific control of dauer entry through ASI neurons.

    review:
      summary: PEK-1 is a well-established eIF2alpha kinase. The IBA annotation 
        is consistent with phylogenetic conservation and experimental evidence 
        from C. elegans studies showing that PEK-1 phosphorylates eIF2alpha to 
        attenuate translation during ER stress (PMID:10677345, PMID:11779465, 
        PMID:22125500).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is the core molecular function of PEK-1. Direct evidence from
        expression of C. elegans PEK in yeast demonstrated eIF2alpha 
        hyperphosphorylation (PMID:10677345). The IBA annotation correctly 
        captures the conserved kinase activity at the appropriate level of 
        specificity.

    review:
      summary: Nuclear localization is suggested by phylogenetic inference from 
        mammalian PERK, which can translocate to the nucleus under certain 
        conditions. However, the primary localization of PEK-1 is at the ER 
        membrane as a type I transmembrane protein.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While PERK family members may have nuclear functions, the core 
        localization and function of PEK-1 is at the ER membrane. This 
        annotation may reflect a secondary or conditional localization rather 
        than the primary site of function. UniProt annotation indicates ER 
        membrane as the primary location.

      summary: The cytoplasmic domain of PEK-1 contains the kinase domain that 
        phosphorylates eIF2alpha in the cytoplasm. This annotation reflects that
        the kinase domain faces the cytoplasm.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: PEK-1 is a type I transmembrane protein with a large cytoplasmic 
        kinase domain (aa 475-1077 per UniProt). The kinase activity occurs in 
        the cytoplasm where eIF2alpha substrates reside. This is consistent with
        the protein topology.

        protein synthesis attenuation during ER stress.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a direct consequence of PEK-1's eIF2alpha kinase activity.
        Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha leads to global translational repression, 
        which is the primary outcome of PEK-1 activation during stress.

        similarity to mammalian PERK, which is established as an ER membrane 
        protein.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The ISS annotation is appropriate given the strong sequence 
        conservation with mammalian PERK and the conserved domain architecture 
        including a signal peptide, lumenal domain, transmembrane domain, and 
        cytoplasmic kinase domain.

      label: negative regulation of translational initiation
    evidence_type: IC
    original_reference_id: PMID:10677345
    review:
      summary: PMID:10677345 provides the basis for inferring that PEK-1 
        negatively regulates translational initiation through eIF2alpha 
        phosphorylation, which inhibits eIF2B and prevents translation 
        initiation.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The IC annotation appropriately captures the logical inference 
        from the demonstrated eIF2alpha kinase activity to its regulatory 
        consequence on translational initiation. Phosphorylated eIF2alpha 
        inhibits eIF2B, preventing GDP-GTP exchange needed for translation 
        initiation.

    original_reference_id: PMID:23335331
    review:
      summary: PMID:23335331 (Schipanski et al. 2013) uses a C. elegans model of
        FENIB (familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies) to 
        show that UPR pathways including PEK-1 modulate protein aggregation and 
        respond to misfolded proteins.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The annotation captures PEK-1's role in responding to 
        topologically incorrect/misfolded proteins. The paper shows that 
        downregulation of UPR pathways (including pek-1) favors mutant protein 
        accumulation.

    review:
      summary: PMID:23335331 demonstrates genetic interactions showing that 
        PEK-1 and other UPR components respond to topologically incorrect 
        proteins (aggregating neuroserpin mutants).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The IGI annotation reflects genetic interaction evidence where 
        loss of pek-1 in combination with other UPR mutations affects the 
        response to misfolded proteins.

proposed_new_terms: []
suggested_questions:
  - question: Does PEK-1 have substrates beyond eIF2alpha in C. elegans? Recent 
      work suggests eIF2alpha-independent functions during dietary restriction. 
      Ma et al. 2023 showed that dietary restriction phenotypes can occur 
      without eIF2alpha phosphorylation, but combined loss of gcn-2 and pek-1 
      abolished DR-induced lifespan extension, suggesting additional substrates 
      or functions.
  - question: What is the tissue-specific expression pattern of PEK-1 beyond 
      intestinal cells? UniProt notes expression in intestinal cells; work on 
      dauer entry shows neuron-specific (ASI) function; comprehensive tissue 
      expression data would be valuable.
suggested_experiments:
  - description: Phosphoproteomics in pek-1 mutants vs wild-type under ER stress
      to identify additional PEK-1 substrates beyond eIF2alpha. Recent evidence 
      suggests eIF2alpha-independent functions of PEK-1; identifying additional 
      substrates would provide mechanistic insight.
  - description: Tissue-specific rescue experiments to determine which tissues 
      require PEK-1 for different stress responses (ER stress, replication 
      stress, immune activation). PEK-1 has been shown to function in intestine 
      and ASI neurons; systematic tissue-specific analysis would define where 
      PEK-1 is required for each stress response.
