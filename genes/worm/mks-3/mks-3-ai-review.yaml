description: 'MKS-3 is the C. elegans ortholog of human TMEM67/meckelin, a transmembrane
  protein that localizes to the ciliary transition zone. It functions as a component
  of the MKS module (together with MKS-1, MKSR-1, MKSR-2, MKS-5, and MKS-6), which
  cooperates with the NPHP module to establish basal body/transition zone membrane
  associations and ciliary gate function during ciliogenesis. MKS-3 is required for
  non-motile cilium assembly through genetic interactions with the NPHP module, and
  participates in restricting non-ciliary membrane proteins from entering the ciliary
  compartment, thereby establishing the transition zone as a selective barrier (ciliary
  gate).
