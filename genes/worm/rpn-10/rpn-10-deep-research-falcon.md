## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O61742
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 4 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P55036}; AltName: Full=26S proteasome regulatory subunit rpn-10 {ECO:0000305};
- **Gene Information:** Name=rpn-10 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:B0205.3}; ORFNames=B0205.3 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:B0205.3};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the proteasome subunit S5A family.
- **Key Domains:** PSMD4. (IPR027040); UIM_dom. (IPR003903); VWF_A. (IPR002035); vWFA_dom_sf. (IPR036465); UIM (PF02809)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "rpn-10" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'rpn-10' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **rpn-10** (gene ID: rpn-10, UniProt: O61742) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: rpn-10 (UniProt: O61742) in Caenorhabditis elegans

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and nomenclature: rpn-10 encodes the C. elegans ortholog of yeast Rpn10 and vertebrate PSMD4/S5a, a non-ATPase ubiquitin-receptor subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome (regulatory particle non-ATPase 4) (published 2016-02; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). In C. elegans, RPN-10 is broadly expressed and localizes to both cytoplasm and nucleus in multiple tissues (pharynx, intestine, hypodermis, spermatheca) (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). The gene corresponds to the S5a family ubiquitin receptor subunit, consistent with UniProt O61742 (rpn-10) (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 2-4, keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 4-6)

- Domain architecture: RPN-10 contains an N-terminal von Willebrand factor A (vWA) domain with a conserved DNSE sequence critical for 19S binding, and two C-terminal ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM/UID-like motifs) that recognize polyubiquitin chains (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). The rpn-10(ok1865) deletion removes the vWA domain, the DNSE motif, and the first UIM, producing a strong loss-of-function allele (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 4-6)

- Molecular function: As a 19S proteasome ubiquitin receptor, RPN-10 binds polyubiquitin chains on substrates to promote engagement with the 26S proteasome; in C. elegans RPN-10 functions together with RPN-13 as recognition modules (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). In mammals, phosphorylation within the linker between UIM1/2 of PSMD4 (human Rpn10) modulates substrate selection during the DNA damage response, indicating regulatory control of receptor “receptiveness” that is likely conserved structurally across metazoans (Zhang et al., 2024-08; PNAS; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2321204121). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 2-4, zhang2024dnadamageinducedproteasome pages 9-11)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- ER quality control (ERQC) adaptation in rpn-10 mutants: A 2023 study showed rpn-10(ok1865) worms are highly ER-stress resistant and display constitutive ER UPR activation (increased xbp-1 splicing) with upregulation of ERQC/ERAD genes; improved ER proteostasis was demonstrated by reduced intestinal aggregation of alpha-1 antitrypsin Z (ATZ) reporters (Chinchankar et al., 2023-09; BBA Gene Regulatory Mechanisms; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2023.194957). A genetic suppressor screen identified ecps-2/H04D03.3 (ECM29/ECPAS ortholog) as required for both enhanced ER proteostasis and longevity in rpn-10 mutants, suggesting a proteasome–ECPS-2 axis underlies a novel ER adaptation (Chinchankar et al., 2023-09; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2023.194957). Temperature-responsive induction of ecps-1/ecps-2 was noted, and AIP-1/AIRAP (a SKN-1/HSF-1-regulated proteasome cofactor) was implicated in the adaptive program (Chinchankar et al., 2023-09; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2023.194957). (chinchankar2023anovelendoplasmic pages 1-2, chinchankar2023anovelendoplasmic pages 17-19)

- Proteasome receptor phosphorylation and substrate selection: In human cells, DNA damage–induced phosphorylation of PSMD4 at S266 (between UIM1 and UIM2) restricts degradation of a subset of nuclear proteins to facilitate DNA repair, evidencing that post-translational modification of the Rpn10 receptor configures UIM geometry and chain recognition; TMT-MS showed substantially fewer stabilized proteins in an S266N mutant compared with WT after camptothecin (4 h: 53 vs 203; 8 h: 61 vs 314), indicating altered substrate acceptance (Zhang et al., 2024-08; PNAS; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2321204121). These findings refine understanding of ubiquitin receptor regulation applicable to metazoan RPN-10 family proteins including C. elegans. (zhang2024dnadamageinducedproteasome pages 9-11)

- Pharmacologic modulation of UPS using RPN-10 UIMs as sensors: In C. elegans, a fluorescent polyubiquitin reporter built from RPN-10 UIMs was used to show that floxuridine (FUdR) reduces polyubiquitinated protein burden and increases proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity during proteasome subunit deficiency or inhibition, supporting UPS function via a detoxification pathway independent of canonical proteostasis regulators (Dubey et al., 2024-07; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011371). While not a direct RPN-10 ligand, this demonstrates a real-world application of RPN-10 UIMs and points to therapeutically relevant UPS support under stress. (dubey2024floxuridinesupportsups pages 4-6)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Proteostasis/longevity interventions: rpn-10 loss triggers adaptive programs (SKN-1-driven proteasome gene upregulation, autophagy/lysosome activation, ERQC enhancement) that confer heat and oxidative stress resistance and increased lifespan, highlighting nodes that can be targeted pharmacologically or genetically for proteostasis and healthy aging (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823; Chinchankar et al., 2023-09; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2023.194957). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 23-24, keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 12-13, chinchankar2023anovelendoplasmic pages 1-2)

- UPS activity reporters and screening: RPN-10-based UIM reporters enable in vivo monitoring of polyubiquitin load and have been used to identify compounds such as FUdR that preserve UPS function during stress, with translational potential for proteotoxic conditions (Dubey et al., 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011371). (dubey2024floxuridinesupportsups pages 4-6)

- Implications for targeted protein degradation (TPD) and DDR: The demonstration that PSMD4 UIM spacing/phosphorylation modulates substrate acceptance suggests that proteasome receptor state can influence efficacy of TPD approaches and DDR-associated proteolysis, informing drug design and scheduling around genotoxic therapies (Zhang et al., 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2321204121). (zhang2024dnadamageinducedproteasome pages 9-11)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Adaptive remodeling to proteasome dysfunction: Keith et al. interpret the rpn-10 deletion phenotype as an adaptive response wherein SKN-1 is required for development, proteasome subunit upregulation, and lifespan/oxidative stress resistance; autophagy and lysosome functions are broadly upregulated, and intestinal factor ELT-2 supports development in this context (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 12-13, keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 23-24)

- ER adaptation as a determinant of longevity: Chinchankar et al. propose that a proteasome–ECPS-2 (ECM29-like) axis tethers/conditions proteasomes at the ER to bolster ERQC, which is necessary for rpn-10 longevity and reduced ER client aggregation, integrating SKN-1/AIP-1 signaling with XBP-1-mediated ER programs (Chinchankar et al., 2023-09; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2023.194957). (chinchankar2023anovelendoplasmic pages 17-19, chinchankar2023anovelendoplasmic pages 1-2)

- Receptor-level regulation of substrate selectivity: Zhang et al. emphasize that proteasome receptors themselves gate access to the proteasome depending on phosphorylation state, updating the classical view that E3-driven chain formation solely dictates selectivity (Zhang et al., 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2321204121). (zhang2024dnadamageinducedproteasome pages 9-11)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Structural/allelic definition: rpn-10(ok1865) is a 1,166 bp deletion removing most 5′ UTR, exons 1–3 and part of exon 4, abolishing the vWA, DNSE motif, and UIM1; a C-terminal truncation allele (tm1180) accumulates polyubiquitinated proteins (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 4-6)

- UPS activity readouts: In rpn-10(ok1865), a UPS reporter (UbV::GFP) accumulates robustly relative to wild type (quantified by imaging; p = 0.001 and p < 0.001 by t-test for specific comparisons), indicating selective UPS impairment with intact control mCherry (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 4-6)

- Cellular localization: RPN-10::GFP shows strongest expression in pharynx, intestine, hypodermis, and spermatheca; signal appears in both nucleus and cytoplasm; RNAi reduces expression broadly except the pharynx (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 4-6)

- Stress resistance and lifespan: rpn-10 mutants are heat- and oxidative stress–resistant, with increased lifespan; SKN-1 is required for the extended lifespan and oxidative stress resistance, and rpn-10 animals exhibit elevated gst-4p::GFP signal; juglone (100 μM) was used in assays (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 23-24, keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 12-13)

- ER proteostasis metrics: rpn-10 mutants show higher resistance to ER stressors and reduced intestinal ATZ aggregation; ERQC gene expression and xbp-1 splicing are elevated basally; ecps-2 is necessary for both ER proteostasis enhancement and longevity; temperature increases induce ecps-1/ecps-2 (Chinchankar et al., 2023-09; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2023.194957). (chinchankar2023anovelendoplasmic pages 1-2, chinchankar2023anovelendoplasmic pages 17-19)

- Receptor phosphorylation/TPD implications: PSMD4 S266 phosphorylation between UIMs reduces proteasomal degradation of a defined subset of nuclear proteins under DNA damage; proteins stabilized in WT vs S266N after CPT were 203 vs 53 (4 h) and 314 vs 61 (8 h), respectively (Zhang et al., 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2321204121). (zhang2024dnadamageinducedproteasome pages 9-11)

- Pharmacologic modulation: In vivo, FUdR reduces polyubiquitin load measured by an RPN-10-UIM reporter and increases proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity during proteasome inhibition or subunit deficiency, independently of major proteostasis regulators and without evidence for direct proteasome binding (Dubey et al., 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011371). (dubey2024floxuridinesupportsups pages 4-6)

Organism-specific functions, pathways, and development
- Primary role in UPS: RPN-10 is a receptor for ubiquitinated substrates at the 19S particle, contributing to substrate recognition; its loss reduces UPS function in vivo as evidenced by selective accumulation of UPS reporters and ubiquitin conjugates (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 4-6, keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 2-4)

- Stress/defense pathways: rpn-10 mutants activate SKN-1, leading to widespread proteasome subunit upregulation and enhanced oxidative stress defenses; autophagy and lysosome pathways are upregulated; ELT-2 supports development under these conditions (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). ERQC is constitutively enhanced via an ECPS-2–dependent mechanism; AIP-1/AIRAP is implicated (Chinchankar et al., 2023-09; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2023.194957). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 12-13, keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 23-24, chinchankar2023anovelendoplasmic pages 1-2, chinchankar2023anovelendoplasmic pages 17-19)

- Developmental/germline roles: rpn-10 loss leads to reduced fertility and feminization of the germline linked to impaired degradation of regulatory targets (e.g., TRA-2), and viability is compromised when combined with loss of certain subunits (e.g., rpn-12), indicating genetic interactions within the 19S (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). Additional literature reports involvement in sex determination in worms, further connecting RPN-10 to developmental decisions (Fernando et al., 2020-04, citing Shimada et al.; microPublication Biology; https://doi.org/10.17912/micropub.biology.000234). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 2-4, fernando2020lossofproteasome pages 3-3)

- Linkage and receptor complementarity: While detailed linkage preferences were defined in mammalian PSMD4, Rpn10-family UIMs typically recognize K48-linked polyubiquitin; the PNAS 2024 study directly examined K48-modified substrates and showed that UIM spacing and phosphorylation state tune acceptance during DNA damage, implying dynamic receptor complementarity with RPN-13 and shuttle factors across eukaryotes (Zhang et al., 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2321204121; Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). (zhang2024dnadamageinducedproteasome pages 9-11, keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 2-4)

Verification of identity and domains against UniProt brief
- Symbol and organism: rpn-10 in C. elegans encodes a 19S non-ATPase ubiquitin receptor orthologous to PSMD4/S5a, matching the UniProt O61742 description; all gathered studies were in C. elegans or conserved metazoan contexts (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823; Chinchankar et al., 2023-09; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2023.194957). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 2-4, chinchankar2023anovelendoplasmic pages 1-2)
- Domains: vWA domain and dual UIMs are documented in the worm protein; the ok1865 allele removes vWA, DNSE, and UIM1, consistent with the UniProt domain annotation (Keith et al., 2016-02; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005823). (keith2016gradedproteasomedysfunction pages 4-6)

Limitations and open questions
- Precise 19S positional mapping (lid vs base) and quantitative chain-linkage preferences are not directly resolved in the C. elegans literature cited here; mammalian structural-functional work indicates receptor-state control via phosphorylation between UIMs, which may be conserved but requires direct testing in C. elegans (Zhang et al., 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2321204121).
