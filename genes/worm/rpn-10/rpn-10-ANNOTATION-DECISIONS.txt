ANNOTATION DECISION SUMMARY
================================================================================

Total Annotations: 14
Decision: ACCEPT ALL (11 core + 3 supporting) + KEEP_AS_NON_CORE (2 phenotypic)
Recommendation: NO CHANGES REQUIRED

================================================================================
CORE FUNCTION ANNOTATIONS (11 annotations) - ALL ACCEPT
================================================================================

ANNOTATION 1: GO:0031593 - polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding
Evidence Code: IBA
Original Reference: GO_REF:0000033 (PANTHER phylogenetic inference)
Decision: *** ACCEPT *** (CORE FUNCTION)
Confidence: VERY HIGH
Rationale:
  - This is THE core molecular function of RPN-10
  - Mediated by two UIM domains (residues 216-235 and 273-292)
  - UIM domains specifically recognize K48-linked polyubiquitin chains
  - Conserved across eukaryotes (human PSMD4, yeast Rpn10, Arabidopsis)
  - NOT a vague "protein binding" term - specific to polyubiquitin modification
  - InterPro confirms UIM domains (IPR003903, PF02809)
  - This function is prerequisite for all proteasomal substrate delivery
Evidence Quality: Excellent (IBA + structure + conservation)
Alternative Actions Considered: NONE - this is clearly appropriate

ANNOTATION 2: GO:0043161 - proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process
Evidence Code: IBA
Original Reference: GO_REF:0000033 (PANTHER phylogenetic inference)
Decision: *** ACCEPT *** (CORE FUNCTION)
Confidence: VERY HIGH
Rationale:
  - This is the primary biological process in which RPN-10 participates
  - Describes delivery of polyubiquitinated substrates to 26S proteasome
  - Conserved molecular mechanism across eukaryotes
  - Supported by loss-of-function evidence (substrate accumulation in rpn-10 mutants)
  - Appropriate specificity (not just "protein catabolic process")
  - Central to understanding RPN-10 biological significance
Evidence Quality: Excellent (IBA + experimental support)
Alternative Actions Considered: NONE - this represents the core biological function

ANNOTATION 3: GO:0008540 - proteasome regulatory particle, base subcomplex
Evidence Code: IBA
Original Reference: GO_REF:0000033 (PANTHER phylogenetic inference)
Decision: *** ACCEPT *** (CORE FUNCTION)
Confidence: VERY HIGH
Rationale:
  - Describes structural positioning within the 19S regulatory particle
  - RPN-10 is canonical component of base subcomplex (proximal to 20S core)
  - vWFA domain mediates direct interaction with 20S proteolytic core
  - UIM domains extend toward substrate binding regions
  - This structural organization is conserved across eukaryotes
  - Appropriate level of specificity (neither too general nor overly specific)
Evidence Quality: Excellent (structural conservation, phylogenetic inference)
Alternative Actions Considered: NONE - this is accurate structural role

ANNOTATION 4: GO:0006511 - ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process
Evidence Code: IMP
Original Reference: PMID:17050737 (Shimada et al., 2006)
Decision: *** ACCEPT *** (CORE FUNCTION)
Confidence: HIGH
Rationale:
  - Direct experimental evidence from loss-of-function studies
  - rpn-10 knockdown causes accumulation of polyubiquitinated substrates (TRA-2)
  - Demonstrates essential requirement for ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism
  - Broader than GO:0043161 but still specific (not generic "protein catabolic process")
  - IMP is solid evidence for functional participation
  - Shimada et al.: "TRA-2 proteins accumulated in rpn-10-defective worms"
Evidence Quality: Good (experimental - loss of function)
Note: Both GO:0043161 (proteasome-mediated) and GO:0006511 (general) are appropriate;
      GO:0043161 is more specific and preferred for primary annotation

ANNOTATION 5: GO:0005829 - cytosol
Evidence Code: IBA
Original Reference: GO_REF:0000033 (PANTHER phylogenetic inference)
Decision: *** ACCEPT *** (CORE LOCALIZATION)
Confidence: VERY HIGH
Rationale:
  - IBA annotation from phylogenetic inference is appropriate for localization
  - Supported by experimental evidence (IDA) from Keith et al. (2016)
  - RPN-10::GFP clearly localizes to cytoplasmic compartment
  - Expected for proteasome subunits (cytoplasm and nucleus)
  - Consistent across multiple cell types and tissues
Evidence Quality: Very Good (IBA + IDA support)
Alternative Actions Considered: Could reduce to IDA only, but IBA+IDA combination is fine

ANNOTATION 6: GO:0005634 - nucleus (IBA)
Evidence Code: IBA
Original Reference: GO_REF:0000033 (PANTHER phylogenetic inference)
Decision: *** ACCEPT *** (CORE LOCALIZATION)
Confidence: VERY HIGH
Rationale:
  - Nuclear proteasome localization is conserved across eukaryotes
  - Supported by direct experimental observation (IDA) from Keith et al.
  - Keith et al.: "RPN-10 is expressed broadly and localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus"
  - Nuclear localization consistent with role in degrading nuclear substrates
  - IBA inference well-supported by experimental data
Evidence Quality: Very Good (IBA + IDA support)
Alternative Actions Considered: Could reduce to IDA, but IBA+IDA combination is fine

ANNOTATION 7: GO:0005634 - nucleus (IDA)
Evidence Code: IDA
Original Reference: PMID:26828939 (Keith et al., 2016)
Decision: *** ACCEPT *** (CORE LOCALIZATION)
Confidence: VERY HIGH
Rationale:
  - Highest quality experimental evidence: direct visualization via RPN-10::GFP
  - Observed in multiple tissues: pharynx, intestine, hypodermis, spermatheca
  - Clear fluorescence signal in nuclear compartment
  - Consistent with known nuclear proteasome activities
Evidence Quality: Excellent (direct observation)
Alternative Actions Considered: NONE - this is unambiguous experimental evidence

ANNOTATION 8: GO:0005737 - cytoplasm (IDA)
Evidence Code: IDA
Original Reference: PMID:26828939 (Keith et al., 2016)
Decision: *** ACCEPT *** (CORE LOCALIZATION)
Confidence: VERY HIGH
Rationale:
  - Same study as annotation 7, but documenting cytoplasmic observation
  - RPN-10::GFP clearly visible in cytoplasm
  - Expected for proteasome subunits with both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions
  - Strong experimental support from direct visualization
Evidence Quality: Excellent (direct observation)
Alternative Actions Considered: NONE - clear experimental support

ANNOTATION 9: GO:0000502 - proteasome complex
Evidence Code: IEA
Original Reference: GO_REF:0000043 (UniProtKB keyword mapping)
Decision: *** ACCEPT *** (SUPPORTING ANNOTATION)
Confidence: HIGH
Rationale:
  - Valid annotation - RPN-10 is part of the 26S proteasome complex
  - IEA evidence is lower quality than IBA, but not incorrect
  - More general than GO:0008540 (regulatory particle, base subcomplex)
  - Both general and specific terms can coexist in GO hierarchy
  - Provides complete description of complex membership
Evidence Quality: Acceptable (electronic annotation, but consistent with evidence)
Alternative Actions Considered: Could remove as redundant, but retention is acceptable

ANNOTATION 10: GO:0005634 - nucleus (IEA)
Evidence Code: IEA
Original Reference: GO_REF:0000044 (UniProtKB subcellular location vocabulary)
Decision: *** ACCEPT *** (SUPPORTING ANNOTATION)
Confidence: HIGH
Rationale:
  - Redundant with IBA and IDA annotations for same term
  - IEA evidence is lower quality than IBA or IDA
  - Not incorrect, just represents annotation layering
  - Consistent with experimental findings
  - Acceptable in GO to have same term with different evidence codes
Evidence Quality: Acceptable (consistent with better evidence)
Alternative Actions Considered: Could remove as redundant, but retention is acceptable

ANNOTATION 11: GO:0005737 - cytoplasm (IEA)
Evidence Code: IEA
Original Reference: GO_REF:0000044 (UniProtKB subcellular location vocabulary)
Decision: *** ACCEPT *** (SUPPORTING ANNOTATION)
Confidence: HIGH
Rationale:
  - Redundant with IBA and IDA annotations
  - IEA is lower quality evidence
  - Consistent with experimental observations
  - Broader term than "cytosol" - includes cytoplasm and nucleoplasm boundary regions
  - Acceptable to retain in GO
Evidence Quality: Acceptable (consistent with better evidence)
Alternative Actions Considered: Could remove as redundant, but retention is acceptable

================================================================================
NON-CORE PHENOTYPIC ANNOTATIONS (2 annotations) - KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
================================================================================

ANNOTATION 12: GO:0007283 - spermatogenesis (IMP)
Evidence Code: IMP
Original Reference: PMID:17050737 (Shimada et al., 2006)
Decision: *** KEEP_AS_NON_CORE *** (SECONDARY PHENOTYPE)
Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (evidence is solid, but classification as non-core is justified)
Rationale:
  - EVIDENCE IS VALID: rpn-10 knockdown causes feminization via spermatogenesis loss
  - Shimada et al.: "knockdown of the rpn-10 gene, but not any other proteasome 
    subunit genes, sexually transforms hermaphrodites to females by eliminating 
    hermaphrodite spermatogenesis"
  - MECHANISM is indirect: Loss of RPN-10 -> impaired TRA-2 degradation -> TRA-2 
    accumulation -> sex determination switch -> feminization
  - NOT A CORE FUNCTION because:
    * RPN-10 has no specialized spermatogenesis molecular function
    * The effect is mediated through its general ubiquitin receptor role
    * The phenotype depends on TRA-2 being a critical sex determination substrate
    * Other proteasome subunits DON'T cause this phenotype (suggesting substrate-
      specific or tissue-specific factors)
    * The effect is a pleiotropic consequence of UPS dysfunction
  - APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION: Mark as non-core while retaining annotation for 
    biological completeness
Evidence Quality: Good (solid loss-of-function evidence)
Why Not Remove?: Removing would loss biological context of rpn-10 in C. elegans
Why Not Promote to Core?: Would be misleading - represents downstream effect, not 
                           direct function
Alternative Actions Considered:
  - REMOVE: Would lose information about organism-specific biology
  - ACCEPT as CORE: Inappropriate - sex determination is not core function
  - KEEP_AS_NON_CORE: Correct choice - retains evidence while maintaining distinction

ANNOTATION 13: GO:0007283 - spermatogenesis (IGI)
Evidence Code: IGI
Original Reference: PMID:17050737 (Shimada et al., 2006)
Interacting Gene: WB:WBGene00006734 (ufd-2, ubiquitin-fusion degradation protein)
Decision: *** KEEP_AS_NON_CORE *** (SECONDARY PHENOTYPE)
Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (genetic evidence is solid, classification as non-core justified)
Rationale:
  - EVIDENCE IS VALID: Genetic interaction between rpn-10 and ufd-2 in sex pathway
  - Shimada et al.: "co-knockdown of rpn-10 and functionally related ubiquitin 
    ligase ufd-2 overcomes the germline-musculinizing effect of fem-3(gf)"
  - MECHANISM: ufd-2 is E4 ubiquitin ligase involved in ubiquitin-dependent TRA-2 
    degradation pathway. Genetic interaction reflects this functional connection.
  - NOT A CORE FUNCTION because:
    * Both genes participate in ubiquitin pathway generally
    * The spermatogenesis effect reflects their interaction in TRA-2 degradation 
      specifically
    * Neither has a specialized spermatogenesis function
    * Genetic interaction demonstrates pathway involvement, not unique function
  - APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION: Mark as non-core while retaining for completeness
Evidence Quality: Good (genetic interaction evidence)
Alternative Actions Considered:
  - REMOVE: Would lose genetic evidence
  - ACCEPT as CORE: Inappropriate - represents context-dependent effect
  - KEEP_AS_NON_CORE: Correct choice

================================================================================
ANNOTATION DECISIONS NOT RECOMMENDED
================================================================================

NOT ANNOTATING: ER quality control, stress responses, longevity effects

Reason: These are ADAPTIVE RESPONSES TO LOSS-OF-FUNCTION, not normal functions

Evidence from Deep Research (2023-2024):
  1. Chinchankar et al. (2023) showed rpn-10 mutants activate ERQC pathway
  2. Keith et al. (2016) showed rpn-10 loss triggers SKN-1-mediated stress responses
  3. These observations are in MUTANT BACKGROUNDS where RPN-10 is absent/reduced

Why These Should NOT Be Annotated:
  - GO annotations describe normal gene functions, not adaptive responses to loss
  - These pathways activate because RPN-10 function is impaired
  - Wild-type RPN-10 function is to PREVENT these compensatory pathways
  - Annotating adaptive responses would misrepresent normal biological function
  - No evidence these are direct RPN-10 functions (vs. responses to dysfunction)

Equivalent to NOT Annotating:
  - "Death-inducing signaling" for a tumor suppressor gene
  - "Metabolic dysregulation" for a diabetes gene
  - "Inflammation response" for an immune gene when knocked out
  - These are CONSEQUENCES of loss, not normal functions

================================================================================
CONFLICT RESOLUTION & VALIDATION
================================================================================

Potential Conflicts Considered:
1. "How can we distinguish core from secondary phenotypes?"
   - Core: Direct molecular interaction or enzymatic activity (GO:0031593, GO:0043161)
   - Secondary: Phenotypic outcome dependent on specific biological context (GO:0007283)
   - Test: Does the function exist independent of context? If no → secondary
   - Application: Spermatogenesis only appears in systems with TRA-2-based sex determination

2. "Should we annotate pleiotropic effects?"
   - GO standard: Annotate all known functions, but use appropriate specificity
   - For RPN-10: Spermatogenesis is real and experimentally documented
   - For RPN-10: But it's indirect, so mark as NON-CORE rather than remove
   - Distinction: Valid evidence ≠ Core function

3. "Why not update based on latest research (2024)?"
   - Zhang et al. (2024) shows phosphorylation-mediated substrate selectivity
   - Chinchankar et al. (2023) shows ER adaptation
   - Neither represents NEW function, just mechanisms/contexts for EXISTING function
   - Mechanisms (regulatory) ≠ Functions (what the protein does)
   - No annotation update needed

Validation Checks Performed:
✓ All evidence codes appropriate to data type
✓ All terms specific and informative (no vague "protein binding")
✓ All localizations match experimental observations
✓ No contradictions between annotations
✓ Proper parent-child relationships maintained (specific vs. general terms)
✓ Distinction between core and secondary roles is consistent
✓ No over-annotation based on mutant phenotypes
✓ Consistent with ortholog annotations (human PSMD4, yeast Rpn10)

================================================================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

VERDICT: MAINTAIN EXISTING ANNOTATIONS - NO CHANGES REQUIRED

The current annotation set for rpn-10 is EXCELLENT and demonstrates:
  ✓ Comprehensive coverage of core functions
  ✓ Appropriate evidence codes
  ✓ Proper specificity (not too general, not overly detailed)
  ✓ Clear distinction between core and secondary roles
  ✓ Strong experimental support for all assertions
  ✓ Avoidance of vague or overly broad terms
  ✓ Consistency with ortholog annotations
  ✓ Sound biological interpretation

ACTIONS REQUIRED:
  1. No changes to existing annotations
  2. Retain NON-CORE designation for spermatogenesis terms
  3. No new annotations to add
  4. Proceed with confidence in current curation

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:
  - Monitor for direct evidence of ER quality control role in wild-type background
  - Track for organism-specific or condition-dependent functional discoveries
  - Continue validation against ortholog annotations as human PSMD4 research evolves
