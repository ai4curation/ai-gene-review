Annotation_Index	GO_ID	GO_Term	Evidence_Code	Original_Reference	Action	Priority	Rationale
1	GO:0005634	nucleus	IBA	GO_REF:0000033	ACCEPT	CORE	Phylogenetic inference supported by experimental evidence (PMID:26828939). Nuclear proteasome localization conserved across eukaryotes.
2	GO:0043161	proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process	IBA	GO_REF:0000033	ACCEPT	CORE	Core conserved function. RPN-10 delivers polyubiquitinated substrates to 26S proteasome. Well-characterized across eukaryotes.
3	GO:0005829	cytosol	IBA	GO_REF:0000033	ACCEPT	CORE	Phylogenetic inference consistent with experimental localization data from Keith et al. (2016). IDA evidence available.
4	GO:0008540	proteasome regulatory particle, base subcomplex	IBA	GO_REF:0000033	ACCEPT	CORE	RPN-10 is canonical base subcomplex component. vWFA domain mediates 20S interaction. Structural role conserved across eukaryotes.
5	GO:0031593	polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding	IBA	GO_REF:0000033	ACCEPT	CORE	Core molecular function. Two UIM domains (216-235, 273-292) specifically recognize K48-linked polyubiquitin. Specific and informative term (not vague "protein binding").
6	GO:0000502	proteasome complex	IEA	GO_REF:0000043	ACCEPT	SUPPORTING	Valid general annotation. Less specific than GO:0008540 but appropriate in GO hierarchy. Both terms can coexist (parent-child).
7	GO:0005634	nucleus	IEA	GO_REF:0000044	ACCEPT	SUPPORTING	Redundant with annotations 1 and 9 but consistent. Lower evidence quality than IBA/IDA. Appropriate for coexistence in GO.
8	GO:0005737	cytoplasm	IEA	GO_REF:0000044	ACCEPT	SUPPORTING	Redundant with annotations 3 and 10. Lower evidence quality but correct. Broader term than cytosol; both are appropriate.
9	GO:0005634	nucleus	IDA	PMID:26828939	ACCEPT	CORE	Highest quality experimental evidence. Keith et al. (2016) direct observation via RPN-10::GFP. Multiple tissues (pharynx, intestine, hypodermis, spermatheca). Quote: "RPN-10 is expressed broadly and localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus"
10	GO:0005737	cytoplasm	IDA	PMID:26828939	ACCEPT	CORE	Direct experimental evidence from same Keith et al. study. RPN-10::GFP clearly visible in cytoplasm. Expected for proteasome subunits with nuclear and cytoplasmic functions.
11	GO:0006511	ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process	IMP	PMID:17050737	ACCEPT	CORE	Strong loss-of-function evidence. Shimada et al. (2006) showed rpn-10 knockdown causes TRA-2 accumulation and reduced proteasomal degradation. Demonstrates essential requirement.
12	GO:0006511	ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process	IGI	PMID:17050737	ACCEPT	SUPPORTING	Genetic interaction with ufd-2 (E4 ubiquitin ligase). Demonstrates functional interaction in ubiquitin pathway. Shimada et al.: co-knockdown of rpn-10 and ufd-2 overcomes fem-3(gf) sex phenotype.
13	GO:0007283	spermatogenesis	IMP	PMID:17050737	KEEP_AS_NON_CORE	SECONDARY	NOT a core RPN-10 function. Spermatogenesis defect is downstream consequence of TRA-2 accumulation and sex determination switch. RPN-10 has no specialized spermatogenesis function. Shimada et al.: rpn-10 knockdown eliminates hermaphrodite spermatogenesis (feminization).
14	GO:0007283	spermatogenesis	IGI	PMID:17050737	KEEP_AS_NON_CORE	SECONDARY	Genetic interaction reflects role in TRA-2 degradation pathway, not intrinsic spermatogenesis function. Represents indirect developmental consequence. Appropriate as non-core.
