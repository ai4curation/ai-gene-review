description: 'RPN-10 is the 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 4, a core
  ubiquitin receptor component of the 19S regulatory particle. The protein contains
  a von Willebrand factor type A (vWFA) domain and two ubiquitin-interacting motifs
  (UIMs) that mediate recognition and binding of polyubiquitinated substrates for
  proteasomal degradation. RPN-10 delivers ubiquitin-conjugated proteins to the 26S
  proteasome for destruction and is essential for normal ubiquitin-proteasome system
  (UPS) function. In C. elegans, RPN-10 has specialized roles in sex determination
  through regulation of TRA-2 protein turnover, and loss of rpn-10 causes feminization
  by eliminating hermaphrodite spermatogenesis. The protein also influences autophagy-lysosome
  pathway activity and proteostasis responses to stress.
