## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q10655
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Transcription factor elt-2 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=GATA-type domain-containing protein elt-2 {ECO:0000305};
- **Gene Information:** Name=elt-2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:C33D3.1}; ORFNames=C33D3.1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:C33D3.1};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Transcription_factor_GATA. (IPR039355); Znf_GATA. (IPR000679); Znf_NHR/GATA. (IPR013088); GATA (PF00320)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "elt-2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'elt-2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **elt-2** (gene ID: elt-2, UniProt: Q10655) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and approach
- Verify identity and domain features; ensure organism specificity and symbol disambiguation.
- Compile primary and recent literature on ELT-2 function, localization, regulatory mechanisms, and pathway crosstalk; prioritize 2023–2024 studies but integrate foundational work where needed.
- Extract quantitative data (gene set enrichments, motif statistics, DEGs, epistasis, survival, lifespan, ChIP–qPCR).
- Synthesize into a comprehensive, cited research report with URLs and publication dates.

Research report: C. elegans elt-2 (UniProt Q10655) – functional annotation

1) Identity, key concepts, and definitions
- Gene/protein identity and domains: elt-2 encodes a C. elegans intestine-restricted GATA-family transcription factor with a canonical GATA-type zinc-finger DNA-binding domain. It is constitutively nuclear in intestinal cells and functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator rather than an enzyme or transporter. Foundational and mechanistic studies consistently define ELT-2 as the terminal differentiation GATA factor for the intestine and a master regulator of adult intestinal gene expression and immunity (PLOS Genetics, 2015-05-28, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005265; Worm, 2015-10-23, https://doi.org/10.1080/21624054.2015.1118607) (block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 1-2, block2015gatatranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).
- Developmental context and definition: In the endoderm gene regulatory network (GRN), maternal and early zygotic inputs establish an interlocked GATA cascade culminating in ELT-2 (with ELT-7) to specify and differentiate the gut. Reviews and syntheses place ELT-2 downstream of SKN-1 → MED-1/2 → END-1/3, acting with partial redundancy with ELT-7 for terminal intestinal gene expression across embryo to adult (Dissertation, 2022, pages dated 2022; https://scholarworks.unavailable) (williams2022investigationoftranscriptional pages 79-82, williams2022investigationoftranscriptional pages 72-75).

2) Mechanisms, localization, and direct/indirect targets
- Subcellular localization: ELT-2 is constitutively nuclear in intestinal cells through larval and adult stages, consistent with a role in both basal and inducible transcriptional programs (PLOS Genetics, 2015-05-28; Worm, 2015-10-23) (block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 1-2, block2015gatatranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).
- Direct DNA recognition and promoter landscape: ELT-2 targets are significantly enriched for proximal promoter GATA motifs. For the “elt-2-induced” adult set, 72% of genes harbor TGATAA motifs in the proximal promoter versus ~42% genome-wide, with strong hypergeometric significance; microarray profiling during infection identified 426 elt-2–responsive transcripts (PLOS Genetics, 2015-05-28) (block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 4-5).
- Target classes and regulatory polarity: Adult ELT-2 regulates two dominant gene classes: (i) digestive/hydrolytic enzymes (proteases, lipases, lysozymes) supporting intestinal function; and (ii) innate immune effectors (e.g., C-type lectins, lysozymes), many of which are induced upon pathogen exposure. ELT-2 control is selective: several structural intestinal genes are not altered by adult elt-2 knockdown (act-5, ifb-2, etc.), indicating a refined regulatory scope (PLOS Genetics, 2015-05-28; Worm, 2015-10-23; URLs above) (block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 5-7, block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 4-5, block2015gatatranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).

3) Pathway integration in adult intestine immunity and stress
- PMK-1/p38 → ATF-7 and SKN-1 cooperation: In adults, ELT-2 acts as a tissue-specific master regulator of p38/PMK-1–dependent innate immune induction. Pathogen exposure activates PMK-1, which phosphorylates ATF-7 to convert it from repressor to activator; ATF-7 then cooperates with ELT-2 to induce immune genes. SKN-1 contributes to a subset, activated via PMK-1 and/or ROS. Genetic epistasis and qRT–PCR/survival assays support that elt-2 is required for effective expression of many ATF-7–dependent targets, and for subsets of SKN-1 targets (e.g., F55G11.2, C32H11.12). Overlap analyses show 38% and 33% of sek-1/pmk-1 targets intersect with elt-2 sets (PLOS Genetics, 2015-05-28; Worm, 2015-10-23) (block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 5-7, block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 9-11, block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 11-13, block2015gatatranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).
- Neuro-immune modulation (2024): Loss of the neuronal GPCR NPR-15 activates immunity while suppressing avoidance. Transcriptomics and functional assays show that enhanced pathogen resistance in npr-15 mutants requires ELT-2 and HLH-30/TFEB; elt-2 RNAi abrogates the resistance phenotype. Enrichment analyses place ELT-2 alongside PMK-1 and DAF-16 programs, indicating coordinated regulation across intestinal and neuronal axes via ASJ sensory neurons (eLife, 2024-03-08, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.90051) (otarigho2024neuronalnpr15modulates pages 4-6).
- Proteostasis/lysosome surveillance and healthspan (recent advance): Silencing vha-6 (intestinal V-ATPase) elicits a lysosomal surveillance response (LySR) that extends lifespan by ~60%. ELT-2 is required for LySR activation and longevity: elt-2 RNAi attenuates LySR reporter induction; ELT-2 ChIP–qPCR shows robust binding to promoters of lysosomal proteases (cpr-5, cpr-8, ctsa-1, asp-10) upon LySR activation (P < 0.0001). Transcriptomics revealed thousands of DEGs including innate immune and lysosome-related genes, with ELT-2 central to executing the program (Nature Cell Biology, 2025-06-17, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-025-01693-y) (li2025alysosomalsurveillance pages 5-6).

4) Developmental roles and gene network logic
- Cascade and redundancy: ELT-2 and ELT-7 are partially redundant terminal differentiation GATA factors in the endoderm GRN. ELT-2’s influence spans embryo to adult, with dynamic regulatory impacts and both activation and repression within intestinal networks; negative autoregulatory features and feedforward logic help ensure robust fate-locking and functional maturation (Dissertation, 2022) (williams2022investigationoftranscriptional pages 79-82, williams2022investigationoftranscriptional pages 72-75).

5) Current applications, real-world implementations, and data
- Infection and immunity assays: Adult-specific elt-2 knockdown reduces resistance to diverse enteric pathogens and suppresses induction of ELT-2 target immune genes; epistasis with p38 components (nsy-1/sek-1/pmk-1) delineates dependency and cooperation (PLOS Genetics, 2015-05-28; Worm, 2015-10-23; URLs above) (block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 5-7, block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 11-13, block2015gatatranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).
- Neuro-immune axis manipulation: npr-15 mutants exhibit ELT-2- and HLH-30-dependent enhanced resistance; genetic perturbation of elt-2 reverts this phenotype, providing a framework to probe gut–brain immune regulation and candidate therapeutic axes in host–pathogen studies (eLife, 2024-03-08; URL above) (otarigho2024neuronalnpr15modulates pages 4-6).
- Proteostasis/aging paradigms: Intestinal V-ATPase perturbation (vha-6 RNAi) engages an ELT-2–dependent LySR, improving proteostasis and extending lifespan, positioning ELT-2 as a lever for healthspan interventions in nematode models (Nature Cell Biology, 2025-06-17; URL above) (li2025alysosomalsurveillance pages 5-6).

6) Quantitative statistics and data highlights
- Promoter motif enrichment: 72% of elt-2-induced genes carry proximal GATA motifs vs 42% genome-wide; hypergeometric enrichment highly significant (PLOS Genetics, 2015-05-28) (block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 4-5).
- Gene overlaps: 38% (sek-1) and 33% (pmk-1) targets overlap with elt-2 gene sets, supporting pathway integration (PLOS Genetics, 2015-05-28) (block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 5-7).
- Differential expression breadth: 426 transcripts differentially expressed upon adult elt-2 RNAi during infection challenge; immune GO terms significantly enriched (e.g., innate immunity p = 1.5 × 10−15) (PLOS Genetics, 2015-05-28) (block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 4-5, block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 5-7).
- LySR and longevity: Lifespan extension of ~60% with vha-6 RNAi; ELT-2 ChIP–qPCR enrichment at lysosomal protease promoters upon LySR activation (P < 0.0001), and broad DEGs (thousands) in lysosome/immune categories (Nature Cell Biology, 2025-06-17) (li2025alysosomalsurveillance pages 5-6).
- Neuro-immune functional requirement: Enhanced resistance of npr-15 mutants is reversed by elt-2 RNAi; RNA-seq enrichments highlight ELT-2, HLH-30, PMK-1, DAF-16 signatures; qRT–PCR validated multiple ELT-2 target effectors (eLife, 2024-03-08) (otarigho2024neuronalnpr15modulates pages 4-6).

7) Expert opinions and synthesis
- Tissue-specific master regulator: ELT-2 is best understood as a constitutive, intestine-restricted GATA TF that scaffolds inducible programs through cooperation with stress and immune TFs (ATF-7, SKN-1), conferring specificity and robustness to adult intestinal defenses while maintaining digestive capacity (Worm, 2015-10-23; PLOS Genetics, 2015-05-28) (block2015gatatranscriptionfactors pages 2-3, block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 1-2, block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 9-11).
- Integration with broader stress and longevity programs: Recent findings place ELT-2 as a critical executor of lysosomal/proteostasis responses that extend healthspan, and as a node receiving neuronal regulation to tune intestinal immunity, indicating a broader physiological role beyond classical gut differentiation (eLife, 2024-03-08; Nature Cell Biology, 2025-06-17) (otarigho2024neuronalnpr15modulates pages 4-6, li2025alysosomalsurveillance pages 5-6).

8) Gaps and limitations in the present evidence set
- While multiple studies implicate ELT-2 alongside DAF-16 and HLH-30 programs, direct biochemical mapping of ELT-2’s interactions with these factors in 2023–2024 literature is limited in the current corpus. Similarly, although ELT-2 is often used as a benchmark in microbiome and TGF-β/DBL-1 studies, direct 2023–2024 mechanistic dissection linking ELT-2 to microbiome composition or DBL-1 signaling is not available in the evidence assembled here; these connections should be interpreted cautiously and warrant further targeted review (context grounded by 2015–2024 sources above) (block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 5-7, block2015gatatranscriptionfactors pages 2-3, otarigho2024neuronalnpr15modulates pages 4-6).

Conclusions
ELT-2 is the canonical intestine-specific GATA transcription factor in C. elegans, constitutively nuclear and essential for terminal intestinal gene expression. In adults, ELT-2 selectively regulates digestive/hydrolytic functions and orchestrates p38/PMK-1–dependent innate immune programs by cooperating with ATF-7 and SKN-1, with substantial promoter GATA motif enrichment and pathway target overlap. Recent work expands ELT-2’s significance to neuronally modulated immunity via NPR-15/ASJ and to lysosomal-proteostasis programs that extend lifespan, underscoring ELT-2 as a central hub integrating immune, stress, and longevity pathways in the intestinal epithelium (citations and URLs above) (block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 5-7, block2015thedevelopmentalintestinal pages 9-11, block2015gatatranscriptionfactors pages 2-3, otarigho2024neuronalnpr15modulates pages 4-6, li2025alysosomalsurveillance pages 5-6).
