description: ELT-2 is a GATA-type transcription factor that serves as the master
  regulator of intestinal gene expression in C. elegans. It contains a single 
  GATA-type zinc finger DNA-binding domain and binds to the consensus sequence 
  5'-[AT]GATA[AG]-3'. ELT-2 is expressed exclusively in the intestine from 
  embryogenesis through adulthood, beginning at the 2E cell stage. It is 
  essential for intestinal development and function - null mutants die at the L1
  larval stage with malformed or degenerated gut cells. ELT-2 is the predominant
  transcription factor controlling both constitutive intestinal gene expression 
  (including digestive enzymes) and induced innate immune responses to bacterial
  pathogens. It works in parallel with the p38 MAPK/PMK-1 pathway to regulate 
  immune gene induction, cooperating with transcription factors ATF-7 and SKN-1.
  Additionally, ELT-2 regulates lifespan through transcriptional control of 
  daf-16 isoforms in the intestine.

  review:
    summary: ELT-2 is a well-characterized GATA transcription factor that binds 
      specifically to WGATAR sequences in promoters of target genes. This 
      sequence-specific DNA binding has been demonstrated in multiple studies 
      including direct visualization of ELT-2 binding in living embryos 
      (PMID:10518545) and in vitro binding assays (PMID:15733671, 
      PMID:15734735).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This IBA annotation is well-supported by the phylogenetic inference 
      and is consistent with extensive experimental evidence from C. elegans 
      showing ELT-2 binds specifically to cis-regulatory regions containing GATA
