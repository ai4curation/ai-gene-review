## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q22252
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=FUN14 domain-containing protein fndc-1 {ECO:0000305};
- **Gene Information:** Name=fndc-1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:31233739, ECO:0000312|WormBase:T06D8.7}; ORFNames=T06D8.7 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:T06D8.7};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the FUN14 family. .
- **Key Domains:** FUN14. (IPR007014); FUN14 (PF04930)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "fndc-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'fndc-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **fndc-1** (gene ID: fndc-1, UniProt: Q22252) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
- Objective 1 (identity/domain verification): Confirmed that C. elegans fndc-1 encodes a FUN14 domain–containing protein orthologous to mammalian FUNDC1. Primary literature shows FNDC-1 localizes to mitochondria with protease accessibility consistent with outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), supporting alignment with the FUN14 family. The symbol “fndc-1” is used specifically for C. elegans (WormBase locus T06D8.7) and is distinct from mammalian “FUNDC1”; this report focuses only on the C. elegans gene/protein (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4, lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 1-2).
- Objective 2 (literature retrieval, 2023–2024 prioritized): Most mechanistic primary data are from 2019–2021 C. elegans studies defining FNDC-1 as a mitophagy receptor in stress and developmental contexts; recent 2024 C. elegans–focused review synthesizes mitochondrial quality control roles for FNDC-1 and assays used. Two 2025 preprints expand developmental roles at the oocyte-to-zygote transition; these are treated as preliminary (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4, lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 1-2, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 32-33, sherwood2025programmedmitophagyat pages 11-15, thendral2025mitophagyatthe pages 6-10).
- Objective 3 (evidence extraction): Summarized function, localization, regulation, pathway integration, and phenotypes with quantitative data where available (see embedded evidence table). (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4, lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 1-2, sherwood2025programmedmitophagyat pages 11-15, thendral2025mitophagyatthe pages 6-10, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 32-33, choubey2021molecularmechanismsand pages 16-17, liu2020mitophagyandits pages 6-8, haeussler2020autophagycompensatesfor pages 34-35)
- Objective 4 (synthesis and applications): Integrated statistics, translational context (mitophagy targeting), and expert perspectives from reviews (2020–2024) (liu2020mitophagyandits pages 6-8, choubey2021molecularmechanismsand pages 16-17, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 32-33).
- Objective 5 (final report): Completed below with citations and URLs/dates.

Comprehensive research report: C. elegans fndc-1 (UniProt Q22252)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein identity: fndc-1 (WormBase T06D8.7) encodes the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian FUNDC1, a conserved FUN14-domain protein functioning as a mitophagy receptor. Experimental data support mitochondrial localization and function in selective mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) in C. elegans (Lim et al., Autophagy, Jan 2021; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2021.1872885) (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4, lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 1-2).
- Mitophagy receptor concept: FUNDC1-family receptors reside in the OMM and bind ATG8/LC3 family proteins via an LC3-interacting region (LIR) to target mitochondria for autophagic degradation; in mammals, LIR-dependent LC3 binding is regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which modulate receptor activity (Choubey et al., Cells, Dec 2021; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11010038; Liu et al., Antioxidants & Redox Signaling, Apr 2020; https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2019.8013) (choubey2021molecularmechanismsand pages 16-17, liu2020mitophagyandits pages 6-8).
- Domain/family alignment: The C. elegans protein belongs to the FUN14 family, consistent with conserved receptor features (LIR, OMM localization, ER–mitochondria contact enrichment) that are well established for mammalian FUNDC1 and are observed for FNDC-1 in worm developmental contexts (choubey2021molecularmechanismsand pages 16-17, liu2020mitophagyandits pages 6-8, sherwood2025programmedmitophagyat pages 11-15).

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024, plus 2025 preprints as preliminary)
- 2024 expert review (C. elegans): A recent review of mitochondrial quality control in Alzheimer’s disease models highlights fndc-1 as one of the conserved mitophagy receptors in C. elegans, summarizing that loss of fndc-1 reduces mitophagy and emphasizing use of mt-Keima/MitoTimer reporters to quantify flux in vivo (Ganguly et al., Antioxidants, Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13111343) (ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 32-33).
- 2025 preprint (developmental mitophagy): Two related preprints report a developmentally programmed mitophagy event at the oocyte-to-zygote transition (MOZT) in C. elegans and identify FNDC-1 as the required receptor. They provide quantitative imaging of mitochondrial fragmentation and volume reduction in the -1 oocyte, and implicate macroautophagy genes and DRP-1. These results broaden FNDC-1’s role beyond stress responses to a physiologic developmental mitophagy program; as preprints, these findings should be considered preliminary pending peer review (bioRxiv Feb 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.01.636045; Research Square Apr 2025; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6330979/v1) (thendral2025mitophagyatthe pages 6-10, sherwood2025programmedmitophagyat pages 11-15).

3) Molecular function, localization, pathways, and phenotypes
- Function as mitophagy receptor under hypoxia–reoxygenation (HR): In body wall muscle, FNDC-1 mediates mitophagy after short HR exposure; loss of fndc-1 delays HR-induced mitophagy measured by mito-mKeima, whereas prolonged HR reveals paradoxical protection in fndc-1 loss-of-function animals through compensatory adaptation (Lim et al., Autophagy, Jan 2021; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2021.1872885) (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4, lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 1-2).
- Subcellular localization: Biochemical fractionation and proteinase K accessibility indicate FNDC-1 is on the OMM. Single-copy mRuby3::FNDC-1 partially co-localizes with mitochondria in muscle and decorates mitochondrial ends; overexpression promotes mitochondrial fragmentation, consistent with receptor activity (Lim et al., Autophagy, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2021.1872885) (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4).
- Developmental mitophagy during oocyte-to-zygote transition (MOZT): FNDC-1 forms puncta at mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), recruits DRP-1, and is necessary for mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy surrounding fertilization. Quantitative imaging shows that ~70% of FNDC-1 puncta are short-lived (10 s–2 min), while ~30% are long-lived (4–8.6 min) and consistently trigger fragmentation; co-localization with mitochondrial foci increases from ~35% in -2 oocytes to ~60% in -1 oocytes. Mitochondrial volume in the oocyte is reduced (~2.0 µm³ to ~0.3 µm³) during MOZT, and this reduction is abrogated by RNAi of autophagy genes (vps-34, atg-16.1/2, vps-41, vha-2/9/12) or drp-1. These findings support FNDC-1 as the receptor executing a developmentally programmed mitophagy independent of PINK1/Parkin in this context (bioRxiv Feb 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.01.636045; Research Square Apr 2025; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6330979/v1) (thendral2025mitophagyatthe pages 6-10, sherwood2025programmedmitophagyat pages 11-15).
- Paternal mitochondria elimination after fertilization: Genetic studies indicate fndc-1 contributes to removal of paternal mitochondria, acting as one of at least two temporally distinct mechanisms (with a ubiquitination-dependent pathway) to target paternal organelles for degradation in the embryo (summarized in PLOS Genetics review and C. elegans MQC review). This situates FNDC-1 in conserved mitochondrial purifying mechanisms at fertilization (Haeussler et al., PLOS Genetics, Mar 2020; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008638; Ganguly et al., Antioxidants, Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13111343) (haeussler2020autophagycompensatesfor pages 34-35, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 32-33).
- Pathway crosstalk and dependencies: Under HR, loss of fndc-1 triggers ATFS-1–dependent UPRmt programs, providing prophylactic protection against subsequent injury, highlighting crosstalk between receptor-mediated mitophagy and mitochondrial stress adaptation (Lim et al., Autophagy, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2021.1872885) (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 1-2). During acute heat stress, autophagy facilitates mitochondrial rebuilding through a DRP-1–dependent process that does not require PINK-1/pdr-1 (Parkin) or fndc-1, suggesting condition-specific redundancy or alternative mitophagy/bulk autophagy pathways (Chen et al., J Cell Biol., Mar 2021; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201909139) (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4).
- Regulatory mechanisms: Direct C. elegans post-translational regulation motifs for FNDC-1 remain incompletely defined in the available worm literature; however, mammalian FUNDC1 regulation provides a strong framework: LIR-dependent LC3 binding is inhibited by phosphorylation at Tyr18 and Ser13 (SRC/CK2) and enhanced by ULK1 phosphorylation (Ser17) and PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation under hypoxia/depolarization; MARCH5-mediated ubiquitination limits receptor abundance early during hypoxia; FUNDC1 interacts with DRP1 and is enriched at MAMs (Choubey et al., Cells, Dec 2021; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11010038; Liu et al., Antioxidants & Redox Signaling, Apr 2020; https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2019.8013). These mechanisms are plausible and partially mirrored by FNDC-1’s DRP-1 recruitment and MAM localization observed in C. elegans development (choubey2021molecularmechanismsand pages 16-17, liu2020mitophagyandits pages 6-8, sherwood2025programmedmitophagyat pages 11-15).

4) Quantitative statistics and data highlights
- HR-induced mitophagy (muscle): fndc-1 loss-of-function significantly reduced the percentage of mitochondria undergoing mitophagy and the number of mitolysosomes (objects >10 pixels) by mito-mKeima imaging at early timepoints; example statistics include P < 0.0002 comparing wild type vs fndc-1[rny14] by two-way ANOVA (Lim et al., Autophagy, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2021.1872885) (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4).
- Developmental MOZT (oocyte): mitochondrial volume reduced from ~2.0 µm³ to ~0.3 µm³ at -1 oocyte; GFP::DRP-1 puncta increased ~2-fold in number and ~1.5-fold in size; FNDC-1 puncta lifetimes showed two classes (~70% short-lived 10 s–2 min; ~30% long-lived 4–8.6 min) with the latter consistently triggering mitochondrial fragmentation; FNDC-1/mitochondria co-localization rose from ~35% (-2 oocytes) to ~60% (-1 oocytes). Autophagy gene RNAi and drp-1 RNAi blocked mitochondrial reduction and mitophagy (bioRxiv Feb 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.01.636045; Research Square Apr 2025; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6330979/v1) (thendral2025mitophagyatthe pages 6-10, sherwood2025programmedmitophagyat pages 11-15).
- Paternal mitochondria elimination: Loss of fndc-1 delays paternal organelle removal, acting alongside ubiquitin-dependent targeting; the redundancy highlights multiple quality control layers around fertilization (Haeussler et al., PLOS Genetics, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008638) (haeussler2020autophagycompensatesfor pages 34-35).

5) Current applications and real-world implementations
- C. elegans as an in vivo platform to quantify mitophagy receptor function: FNDC-1 studies leverage mito-mKeima, MitoTimer, and endogenous reporters (mRuby3::FNDC-1, GFP::DRP-1) to measure mitophagy flux and receptor dynamics in muscle and germline. These assays are applicable to genetic and pharmacologic screening for mitophagy modulators with translational potential for neurodegeneration and ischemia-reperfusion injury (Ganguly et al., Antioxidants, Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13111343; Lim et al., Autophagy, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2021.1872885) (ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 32-33, lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4, lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 1-2).
- Translational inference from mammalian FUNDC1: Regulatory axes (ULK1–PGAM5–SRC/CK2–MARCH5) and MAM enrichment suggest druggable nodes to modulate receptor activity; these are being explored preclinically in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease contexts and provide hypotheses to test in worm for conserved intervention points (Choubey et al., Cells, Dec 2021; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11010038; Liu et al., Antioxidants & Redox Signaling, Apr 2020; https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2019.8013) (choubey2021molecularmechanismsand pages 16-17, liu2020mitophagyandits pages 6-8).

6) Expert opinions and analysis
- Context-dependent roles and compensations: C. elegans studies emphasize that mitophagy is not monolithic. Under heat stress, autophagy-mediated mitochondrial rebuilding is DRP-1–dependent yet independent of fndc-1, pink-1, and pdr-1, indicating alternative or bulk autophagy routes can dominate conditionally. Under HR, receptor-mediated mitophagy via FNDC-1 is engaged early, but chronic stress induces adaptive UPRmt programs that can paradoxically protect in fndc-1 mutants. Together, these underscore the need to interrogate stress-, tissue-, and developmental context when evaluating FNDC-1 function (Chen et al., J Cell Biol., Mar 2021; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201909139; Lim et al., Autophagy, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2021.1872885) (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4, lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 1-2).
- Developmental mitophagy as quality control: The MOZT findings suggest receptor-driven purifying selection of mitochondria at fertilization, aligning with prior observations of paternal mitochondria elimination and extending them to a broader programmed germline event mediated by FNDC-1. If validated, these data position FNDC-1 as a central developmental mitophagy receptor in nematodes (bioRxiv Feb 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.01.636045; Research Square Apr 2025; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6330979/v1) (thendral2025mitophagyatthe pages 6-10, sherwood2025programmedmitophagyat pages 11-15).

7) Limitations and open questions
- Direct phosphorylation/ubiquitination mapping and LIR validation for C. elegans FNDC-1 remain to be fully elucidated; mammalian data provide strong mechanistic hypotheses (PGAM5/ULK1/SRC/CK2/MARCH5) to test in worm. Definitive pathway placement relative to PINK1–PDR-1 (Parkin) and DCT-1/NIX across tissues and stresses requires further genetic epistasis and biochemical work. The MOZT studies are preprints and await peer-reviewed confirmation (choubey2021molecularmechanismsand pages 16-17, liu2020mitophagyandits pages 6-8, thendral2025mitophagyatthe pages 6-10, sherwood2025programmedmitophagyat pages 11-15).

Verification checklist (per request)
- Gene symbol and description: fndc-1 encodes a FUN14 domain–containing protein; primary work in C. elegans confirms orthology to mammalian FUNDC1 and receptor-like function (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4, lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 1-2).
- Organism: Caenorhabditis elegans. All primary citations and reviews here are worm-focused or use worm models (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4, lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 1-2, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 32-33, haeussler2020autophagycompensatesfor pages 34-35).
- Family/domains: FUN14 family; worm findings (OMM localization, DRP-1 recruitment, MAM association) are coherent with mammalian FUNDC1 receptor biology (lim2021fndc1mediatedmitophagyand pages 2-4, choubey2021molecularmechanismsand pages 16-17, liu2020mitophagyandits pages 6-8, sherwood2025programmedmitophagyat pages 11-15).
- Ambiguity: The symbol “fndc-1” in worms is distinct from mammalian “FUNDC1.” This report strictly concerns the worm gene; where mammalian data are referenced, they are used for mechanistic inference only (choubey2021molecularmechanismsand pages 16-17, liu2020mitophagyandits pages 6-8).
