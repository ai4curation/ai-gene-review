  FNDC-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian FUNDC1, a mitophagy receptor that
  resides on the
  mitochondrial outer membrane and mediates selective autophagy of mitochondria. FNDC-1
  belongs to
  the conserved FUN14 family characterized by an LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif
  that enables
  binding to ATG8/LC3 family proteins to target mitochondria for autophagic degradation.
  FNDC-1
  functions in multiple physiological contexts: (1) it mediates hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced
  mitophagy in somatic tissues such as body wall muscle (PMID:33416042), (2) it contributes
  to
  paternal mitochondria elimination after fertilization as a ubiquitin-independent
  mechanism
  (PMID:31233739, PMID:31153831), and (3) recent studies suggest it is required for
  developmentally
  programmed mitophagy at the oocyte-to-zygote transition. FNDC-1 localizes to the
  mitochondrial
  outer membrane and can be found at mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) contact
  sites where it
  recruits the fission factor DRP-1. Unlike the PINK1/Parkin pathway, FNDC-1 represents
  a
  receptor-mediated, ubiquitin-independent mitophagy mechanism. The deep research
  report
  (fndc-1-deep-research-falcon.md) provides comprehensive literature evidence supporting
  these functions.

        The IBA annotation for autophagy of mitochondrion is phylogenetically inferred
        and well-supported
        by experimental data in C. elegans. FNDC-1 mediates mitophagy under hypoxia-reoxygenation

        (PMID:33416042) and contributes to paternal mitochondria elimination (PMID:31233739,
        PMID:31153831).
        The term accurately captures FNDC-1's role in targeting mitochondria for autophagic
        degradation.
        As noted in fndc-1-deep-research-falcon.md, FNDC-1 is the C. elegans ortholog
        of mammalian FUNDC1.
      action: ACCEPT

        This annotation is strongly supported by multiple lines of evidence. The Lim
        et al. 2021 study
        (PMID:33416042) demonstrated that FNDC-1 mediates mitophagy under hypoxia-reoxygenation
        conditions,
        with fndc-1 loss-of-function significantly reducing the percentage of mitochondria
        undergoing
        mitophagy as measured by mito-mKeima reporter. The term GO:0000422 is appropriate
        as it encompasses
        the broader autophagic process for mitochondria without specifying the pathway
        (receptor vs. ubiquitin).

          If paternal mitochondria are not eliminated via this early process, they
          are eventually
          removed from the embryo in a process that depends on the mitophagy adaptor
          protein, fndc-1.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >
      What is the precise LIR motif sequence in C. elegans FNDC-1, and how does phosphorylation
      regulate its interaction with LGG-1/LGG-2 (C. elegans LC3 homologs)? Mammalian
      FUNDC1
      regulation involves phosphorylation of the LIR motif (Tyr18, Ser13, Ser17) by
      SRC, CK2, ULK1,
      and dephosphorylation by PGAM5. The regulatory mechanisms for C. elegans FNDC-1
      remain to
      be fully characterized.
  - question: >
      Does FNDC-1 localize to mitochondria-ER contact sites (MAMs) in C. elegans,
      and what is
      its relationship with DRP-1-mediated mitochondrial fission during mitophagy?
      Recent preprints
      suggest FNDC-1 forms puncta at MAMs and recruits DRP-1 during developmental
      mitophagy at
      the oocyte-to-zygote transition. This mechanism needs validation in peer-reviewed
      studies.
  - question: >
      What is the relationship between FNDC-1 and other mitophagy pathways (PINK-1/PDR-1,
      DCT-1/NIX)
      in C. elegans across different stress conditions and developmental stages? FNDC-1
      operates
      independently of ubiquitination for paternal mitochondria elimination, but the
      pathway
      relationships and possible redundancies in different contexts remain unclear.

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >
      Co-immunoprecipitation or split-GFP complementation assays to detect direct
      interaction
      between FNDC-1 and LGG-1/LGG-2 in vivo. While FNDC-1 is functionally characterized
      as a
      mitophagy receptor, direct physical interaction with C. elegans ATG8 homologs
      has not been
      demonstrated experimentally.
    hypothesis: FNDC-1 directly binds LGG-1/LGG-2 via its LIR motif to recruit 
      autophagosomes to mitochondria
  - description: >
      Site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted LIR motif in FNDC-1 followed by functional
      rescue
      assays (paternal mitochondria elimination, HR-induced mitophagy). This would
      confirm that
      the LIR motif is required for FNDC-1 function in C. elegans and allow comparison
      with
      mammalian FUNDC1 regulatory mechanisms.
    hypothesis: The LIR motif is essential for FNDC-1 mitophagy receptor 
      function
  - description: >
      Phosphoproteomics analysis of FNDC-1 under normoxic vs. hypoxic conditions to
      identify
      regulatory phosphorylation sites. This would reveal whether C. elegans FNDC-1
      is regulated
      by phosphorylation similar to mammalian FUNDC1, and identify the relevant kinases/phosphatases
      in C. elegans.
    hypothesis: FNDC-1 activity is regulated by hypoxia-dependent 
      phosphorylation changes
