description: MKS-5 (also known as NPHP-8/FTM) is the C. elegans ortholog of 
  human RPGRIP1L, a coiled-coil protein that localizes to the ciliary transition
  zone (TZ). MKS-5 serves as a central scaffolding component required for 
  docking/anchoring both the MKS (Meckel syndrome) and NPHP (nephronophthisis) 
  protein modules at the TZ. Through this hierarchical assembly role, MKS-5 is 
  essential for establishing basal body/transition zone membrane associations, 
  forming the ciliary gate that restricts inappropriate accumulation of 
  non-ciliary components within the cilium, and enabling proper ciliogenesis and
  cilia-mediated chemosensation. The protein contains coiled-coil domains and a 
  C2-like domain, and is expressed specifically at the transition zone of 
  ciliated sensory neurons including the amphid neurons.

      summary: MKS-5 localization to the ciliary transition zone is 
        well-supported by multiple IDA annotations from PMID:21422230, 
        PMID:21689635, and PMID:27623382. The IBA annotation correctly infers 
        this localization based on phylogenetic evidence across the RPGRIP1 
        family.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Transition zone localization is the defining characteristic of 
        MKS-5 function. Multiple independent experimental studies have confirmed
        this localization using fluorescence microscopy in C. elegans 
        (PMID:21689635, PMID:21422230, PMID:27623382). This represents a core

      summary: MKS-5 involvement in non-motile cilium assembly is supported by 
        multiple IMP and IGI annotations from PMID:21422230 and PMID:26863025. 
        The IBA correctly propagates this functional role from homologs.

      reason: Non-motile cilium assembly is a core function of MKS-5. C. elegans
        sensory cilia are non-motile, and mks-5 mutants display ciliogenesis 
        defects (PMID:21689635, PMID:21422230). The MKS module proteins work

    review:
      summary: Williams et al. 2011 demonstrated MKS-5 localization to the 
        transition zone and established its central role in TZ organization.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Foundational experimental evidence for MKS-5 TZ localization and 
        function. This study established the modular organization of TZ proteins
        with MKS-5 as a central component.

    review:
      summary: MKS-5 functions as a central molecular adaptor/scaffold at the 
        ciliary transition zone, required for docking and anchoring both MKS and
        NPHP protein modules. Multiple TZ proteins depend on MKS-5 for their 
        localization.
      action: NEW
      reason: This molecular function annotation is supported by extensive 
        evidence from multiple studies. Williams et al. 2011 established MKS-5 
        as a central component required for docking/anchoring MKS and NPHP 
        protein modules. Li et al. 2016 showed CEP-290 and TMEM-218 depend on 
        MKS-5 for TZ localization. This adaptor/scaffolding function is the 
        primary molecular activity of MKS-5 and warrants explicit annotation.
