description: 'NSY-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian ASK1 (Apoptosis Signal-regulating
  Kinase 1), functioning as a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) at the apex of a conserved
  p38 MAPK signaling cascade. NSY-1 phosphorylates and activates SEK-1 (MAPKK), which
  in turn activates PMK-1 (p38 MAPK). This pathway has two major biological roles:
  (1) Originally identified for its role in determining left/right asymmetric odorant
  receptor expression in AWC neurons (hence "neuronal symmetry" - nsy), where it acts
  downstream of calcium signaling via UNC-43/CaMKII and the TIR domain protein TIR-1
  (SARM ortholog); (2) Critical for innate immunity, particularly defense against
  pathogenic bacteria (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative) and fungi. The protein
  localizes to post-synaptic regions of axons in neurons and is expressed in intestine,
  hypodermis, and neurons.
