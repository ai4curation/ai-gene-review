- **Gene Information:** Name=nsy-1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:F59A6.1a}; ORFNames=F59A6.1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:F59A6.1a};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. STE Ser/Thr
- **Key Domains:** DRHyd-ASK. (IPR046872); HisK-N-like. (IPR046873); Kinase-like_dom_sf. (IPR011009); MAP3K_PH. (IPR043969); MAP3K_TRAF-bd. (IPR025136)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "nsy-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'nsy-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **nsy-1** (gene ID: nsy-1, UniProt: Q21029) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity verification: The target is Caenorhabditis elegans nsy-1 encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) orthologous to mammalian ASK1, functioning upstream of SEK-1 (MAPKK) and PMK-1 (p38 MAPK). Multiple primary sources explicitly identify NSY-1 as an ASK1-like MAPKKK in C. elegans and place it within the TIR-1–NSY-1–SEK-1–PMK-1 module (e.g., Chuang & Bargmann 2005; Shivers et al. 2009; Cheesman et al. 2016) (chuang2005atollinterleukin1 pages 1-2, shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesof pages 6-7, cheesman2016aberrantactivationof pages 4-5). The organismal context (C. elegans) and protein family/domain-level homology to ASK1 are consistently supported (chuang2005atollinterleukin1 pages 1-2, cheesman2016aberrantactivationof pages 4-5).

Comprehensive research report on C. elegans nsy-1 (UniProt Q21029)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- NSY-1 definition and enzymatic role: NSY-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian ASK1 and functions as a serine/threonine MAPKKK that activates the MAPKK SEK-1, which in turn activates the p38 MAPK PMK-1. This cascade regulates innate immune gene expression and neuronal developmental decisions (Chuang & Bargmann, Genes & Development, Jan 2005, https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.1276505; Shivers et al., Cell Host & Microbe, Oct 2009, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2009.09.001; Cheesman et al., G3, Mar 2016, https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.115.025650) (chuang2005atollinterleukin1 pages 1-2, shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesof pages 6-7, cheesman2016aberrantactivationof pages 1-2).
- Core pathway: A conserved TIR-domain adaptor TIR-1 (SARM1 ortholog) signals upstream to NSY-1→SEK-1→PMK-1 to orchestrate cell-autonomous intestinal immunity and neuronal programs; downstream transcription factors include ATF-7 (immunity) and SKN-1 (oxidative stress/immune homeostasis) (Shivers et al., PLoS Genetics, Apr 2010, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000892; van der Hoeven et al., PLoS Pathogens, Dec 2011, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002453) (shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesof pages 6-7, shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesofa pages 10-14).
- Localization concepts: In neurons, TIR-1 recruits NSY-1 to synaptic/post-synaptic puncta in AWC sensory neurons to control stochastic left-right asymmetry; in intestine, the module acts within epithelial cells to regulate innate immunity (Chuang & Bargmann 2005; Shivers et al. 2009) (chuang2005atollinterleukin1 pages 1-2, shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesof pages 6-7).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Lysosome-related organelles restrain TIR-1 aggregation: 2024 Cell Reports demonstrated that integrity of lysosome-related organelles suppresses TIR-1 aggregation, thereby restraining toxic propagation of PMK-1/p38 innate immunity in the intestine. This identifies an organelle-anchored regulatory axis upstream of the NSY-1–SEK-1–PMK-1 pathway (Tse-Kang & Pukkila-Worley, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 18-20).
- Learning and behavior: 2023 G3 showed NSY-1/SEK-1 in sensory neurons (ASH, ADF, ASER) mediates learned high-salt chemotaxis; genetic interaction with neuropeptide NLP-3 and receptor NPR-15 suggests NSY-1/SEK-1 modulates neuropeptide signaling between sensory neurons and AIA interneurons (Huang et al., Jun 2023, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkad129) (huang2023multiplep38jnkmitogenactivated pages 1-2).
- Chemotherapy resilience: 2023 Nature Communications found cisplatin exposure in post-mitotic adults triggers PMK-1 and ATF-7 phosphorylation; mutants in the p38 pathway (which includes NSY-1→SEK-1→PMK-1) are cisplatin-sensitive, implicating this module in protection from necrotic damage (Raj et al., May 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5) (pagano2014geneticanalysisofa pages 22-26).
- Updated host–pathogen modeling: 2024 review on Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection highlights the centrality of TIR-1–NSY-1–SEK-1–PMK-1 in intestinal immunity and integration with surveillance of organelles (Hajdú et al., IJMS, Jun 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137034) (shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesofa pages 1-6).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Genetic tools and hyperactivation models: nsy-1(gf) R246Q (ums8) increases PMK-1 phosphorylation, hyperinduces immune effectors, enhances P. aeruginosa resistance, but is developmentally toxic. Conversely, hypomorphic alleles of tir-1, nsy-1, sek-1, or pmk-1 suppress toxicity from an immunostimulatory xenobiotic (R24 at 140 mM), illustrating the need for tight NSY-1 pathway control in therapeutic strategies (Cheesman et al., G3, Mar 2016, https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.115.025650) (cheesman2016aberrantactivationof pages 5-6, cheesman2016aberrantactivationof pages 1-2, cheesman2016aberrantactivationof pages 4-5).
- Probiotic/postbiotic modulation: Multiple interventions leverage the NSY-1 pathway in vivo. Heat-killed Levilactobacillus brevis MKAK9 and its EPS extend longevity and improve proteostasis; these benefits require intact p38 cascade components (nsy-1, sek-1, pmk-1) and engage SKN-1, indicating translational potential for microbiome-inspired or postbiotic strategies (Immunity & Ageing, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12979-024-00457-w). An antimicrobial peptide (2K4L) reduces bacterial burden and inflammatory signaling; in worms, it alleviates oxidative stress by downregulating core p38/PMK-1 pathway signaling proteins and p38 phosphorylation, protecting from Acinetobacter baumannii, illustrating pathway-targeted anti-infective design (Scientific Reports, Jul 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64511-9) (shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesofa pages 1-6, shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesof pages 6-7, pagano2014geneticanalysisof pages 22-26, shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesofa pages 10-14).
- Behavioral and learning paradigms: Targeted neuronal expression and assays of chemotaxis learning provide a platform to probe NSY-1/SEK-1 roles in sensory-to-interneuron neuropeptide signaling, with implications for neuromodulatory therapies (Huang et al., Jun 2023, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkad129) (huang2023multiplep38jnkmitogenactivated pages 1-2).
- Chemoprotection: Activation of the PMK-1/ATF-7 arm mitigates cisplatin toxicity in post-mitotic cells, suggesting p38 pathway modulators as co-therapies to protect host tissues (Raj et al., May 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5) (pagano2014geneticanalysisofa pages 22-26).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Evolutionary and tissue specificity: Reviews and primary studies emphasize that the TIR-1–NSY-1–SEK-1 module is co-opted across tissues, acting cell-autonomously in intestine for immunity and in neurons for behavior and development. This context-specific deployment underlies pleiotropic outputs from a conserved core (Shivers et al., Cell Host & Microbe, 2009; Shivers et al., PLoS Genetics, 2010) (shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesof pages 6-7, shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesofa pages 10-14).
- Regulatory logic and homeostasis: Hyperactivation of NSY-1 is deleterious, necessitating multilayer negative regulation. Genetic screens and organelle-centric regulation of TIR-1 oligomerization (phase transition/aggregation) illustrate upstream control points to tune NSY-1 activity and prevent toxic spread of PMK-1 signaling (Cheesman et al., 2016; Tse-Kang & Pukkila-Worley, 2024) (cheesman2016aberrantactivationof pages 1-2, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 18-20).
- Neuronal developmental mechanism: NSY-1 localization to AWC synapses via TIR-1 integrates Ca2+/CaMKII signaling with a MAPK cascade to enforce stochastic receptor expression (AWCON/AWCOFF). This prototypical synaptic signaling complex highlights spatial control of NSY-1 activity in development (Chuang & Bargmann, 2005) (chuang2005atollinterleukin1 pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and data
- Genetic screen size and allele specifics: A forward genetic screen of ~170,000 mutagenized genomes identified an nsy-1 gain-of-function allele (R246Q, ums8) that increases phosphorylated PMK-1; xenobiotic R24 toxicity assays were performed at 140 mM, with hypomorphic tir-1/nsy-1/sek-1/pmk-1 alleles suppressing toxicity (G3, 2016) (cheesman2016aberrantactivationof pages 5-6, cheesman2016aberrantactivationof pages 4-5).
- Cellular/biochemical readouts: Loss of nsy-1 eliminates the immunoblot band of doubly phosphorylated PMK-1 (p-PMK-1), placing NSY-1 upstream of PMK-1 activation (G3, 2016) (cheesman2016aberrantactivationof pages 4-5).
- Neuronal behavior assays: 2023 G3 reports that NSY-1/SEK-1 function in ASH/ADF/ASER neurons is necessary for learned high-salt chemotaxis after conditioning; NLP-3 and NPR-15 act within the same genetic pathway, indicating a defined circuit-level mechanism (Huang et al., 2023) (huang2023multiplep38jnkmitogenactivated pages 1-2).
- Organellar regulation: 2024 Cell Reports demonstrates that preserving lysosome-related organelle integrity suppresses TIR-1 aggregation, attenuating PMK-1 activation and preventing toxic propagation of innate immunity in the intestine (Tse-Kang & Pukkila-Worley, 2024) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 18-20).

Primary function, substrates, and localization
- Enzymatic/substrate specificity: As a MAPKKK, NSY-1 phosphorylates and activates the MAPKK SEK-1, which phosphorylates p38 MAPK PMK-1; downstream, ATF-7 is a direct PMK-1 substrate regulating immune genes, while SKN-1 is activated via p38 signaling during infection and stress. Genetic and biochemical data (p-PMK-1 loss in nsy-1 mutants) support this linear cascade (Shivers et al., 2010; van der Hoeven et al., 2011; Cheesman et al., 2016) (shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesofa pages 10-14, shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesof pages 6-7, cheesman2016aberrantactivationof pages 4-5).
- Cellular localization and context: In AWC neurons, NSY-1 localizes to post-synaptic puncta via TIR-1/SARM1 and operates within a Ca2+/UNC-43 (CaMKII)-dependent complex to specify olfactory receptor asymmetry; in intestine and epidermis, NSY-1 acts cell-autonomously to induce antimicrobial effectors during infection (Chuang & Bargmann, 2005; Shivers et al., 2009) (chuang2005atollinterleukin1 pages 1-2, shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesof pages 6-7).

Caveats and open questions
- Tissue-specific downstream effectors: While PMK-1/ATF-7 clearly mediate intestinal immunity, the exact downstream MAPK and effectors in certain neuronal contexts (e.g., some AWC outputs) can vary or remain partially unresolved, with evidence for PMK-2 or alternative branches (Shivers et al., 2009; 2010) (shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesof pages 6-7, shivers2009tissuespecificactivitiesofa pages 10-14).
- Upstream triggers and assembly: Although TIR-1 oligomerization and organelle control are now established, the full spectrum of physiological cues and co-factors that bias NSY-1 activation across diverse tissues warrants further dissection (Tse-Kang & Pukkila-Worley, 2024) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 18-20).
