description: PEF-1 (Phosphatase with EF-hands 1) is the sole C. elegans member of
  the RdgC/PPEF family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, distinguished by
  C-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding domains. Expression is restricted to sensory
  neurons including ciliated chemosensory neurons AWB, AWC, ASE, AFD, BAG, and others.
  The protein localizes to sensory cilia via N-terminal myristoylation (Gly-2) and
  palmitoylation (Cys-3), where it is enriched in the ciliary axoneme and excluded
  from the transition zone. PEF-1 requires transition zone proteins (MKS-5, CEP-290)
  for proper ciliary compartmentalization. Functional studies demonstrate that pef-1
  mutants show defects in thermotaxis, salt chemotaxis, CO2 avoidance, and UV light
  avoidance, while osmosensation remains normal. TEM analysis reveals microtubule
  abnormalities in pef-1 mutant cilia, suggesting a role in cilium maintenance. The
  protein binds calcium via its EF-hands and binds manganese as a cofactor for phosphatase
  activity. This is the first PPEF family member demonstrated to function in cilia;
  in contrast, the Drosophila ortholog RdgC functions in non-ciliary rhabdomeric photoreceptors.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from other PPEF family
      members. However, the 2001 study by Ramulu and Nathans (PMID:11312268) found
      CePPEF to be membrane-associated via lipid modifications and localized to neuronal
      cell bodies, dendrites, axons, and cilia. No nuclear localization was observed
      in C. elegans. The 2024 study (PMID:39550471) confirms ciliary localization.
      Nuclear localization may be an artifact of heterologous expression systems or
      represent a minor non-conserved localization in other species.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: No experimental evidence supports nuclear localization of PEF-1 in C.
      elegans. Both PMID:11312268 and PMID:39550471 show exclusive membrane/ciliary
      localization in sensory neurons. The phylogenetic inference may not apply to
      this species.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference. While some cytosolic
      localization may occur, the predominant localization in C. elegans is membrane-associated
      and ciliary. The protein requires myristoylation and palmitoylation for proper
      localization. Cytosolic localization is likely minimal and not the primary site
      of function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While membrane association is the predominant localization, some cytosolic
      presence may occur during protein synthesis/transport. However, the core function
      is at cilia and cell membrane. The IBA inference from other species may reflect
      different localization patterns in those organisms.

      Iron binding is not established for PPEF family members.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This is likely an incorrect inference. PPEF family phosphatases use manganese
