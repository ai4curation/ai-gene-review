description: ATF-4 (also known as ATF-5) is a bZIP transcription factor and the 
  C. elegans ortholog of mammalian ATF4. It functions as a central effector of 
  the integrated stress response (ISR), being preferentially translated when 
  global protein synthesis is reduced due to eIF2alpha phosphorylation or other 
  translation-suppressing conditions. ATF-4 contains two upstream open reading 
  frames (uORFs) in its 5' UTR that normally suppress main-ORF translation; when
  ribosome initiation is slowed, these uORFs are bypassed, leading to increased 
  ATF-4 protein synthesis. ATF-4 localizes to the nucleus and acts as a 
  transcriptional activator, inducing expression of cytoprotective genes 
  including heat shock proteins (sip-1, hsp-70, hsp-16.2) and the 
  transsulfuration enzyme cth-2 (cystathionine gamma-lyase). The ATF-4/cth-2 
  axis increases hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production and protein persulfidation, 
  which are protective modifications that contribute to longevity and stress 
  resistance. ATF-4 overexpression extends lifespan by 7-44% and is required for
  longevity benefits from translation inhibition and mTORC1 suppression. 
  ATF-4-driven longevity requires the canonical longevity transcription factors 
  DAF-16/FOXO, HSF-1, and SKN-1/NRF.

    review:
      summary: ATF-4 is a bZIP transcription factor that binds to DNA regulatory
        regions. The bZIP domain (residues 138-201) contains a basic motif 
        (residues 140-163) for DNA binding and a leucine zipper (residues 
        173-187) for dimerization. Phylogenetic inference from ATF4 orthologs 
        supports sequence-specific DNA binding activity. This is consistent with
        its function as a transcription factor that regulates target genes like 
        cth-2 and heat shock proteins [PMID:35181679].
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: IBA annotation is well-supported by domain architecture (bZIP with
        basic DNA-binding motif) and functional evidence that ATF-4 directly

        heat shock proteins.

suggested_questions:
  - question: What are the specific DNA binding sites/motifs recognized by C. 
      elegans ATF-4? Are they canonical CRE (cAMP response element) sites or 
      different from mammalian ATF4?
    experts:
      - T. Keith Blackwell
      - Collin Y. Ewald
  - question: Does ATF-4 form heterodimers with specific bZIP partners in vivo, 
      and do these partnerships affect target gene specificity?
    experts:
      - Amy E. Keating
      - Albertha J. Walhout
  - question: What is the relative contribution of eIF2alpha-dependent vs. 
      eIF2alpha-independent mechanisms to ATF-4 translation under different 
      stress conditions?

suggested_experiments:
  - description: ChIP-seq for ATF-4 to identify genome-wide binding sites and 
      characterize the DNA motifs recognized by C. elegans ATF-4. This would 
      definitively establish direct ATF-4 targets and allow comparison to 
      mammalian ATF4 binding preferences.
    hypothesis: ATF-4 binds to canonical CRE or related motifs in promoters of 
      target genes like cth-2 and heat shock proteins.
    experiment_type: ChIP-seq
  - description: Tissue-specific rescue experiments to determine which tissues 
      require ATF-4 for longevity (neuronal vs. intestinal vs. hypodermal). 
      ATF-4 is expressed in multiple tissues; identifying the key tissue(s) for 
      lifespan effects would inform the mechanism.
    hypothesis: ATF-4 acts in specific tissues (likely neurons or intestine) to 
      coordinate organism-wide stress responses and longevity.
