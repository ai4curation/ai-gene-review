- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'zip-2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **zip-2** (gene ID: zip-2, UniProt: Q21148) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Title: Functional annotation of C. elegans transcription factor ZIP-2 (UniProt Q21148)

Executive summary
ZIP-2 is a Caenorhabditis elegans basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor in the C/EBP-related subfamily (gene K02F3.4), acting as a central sensor–effector for pathogen- and toxin-induced translational stress. Translation attenuation, notably during Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, relieves repression by a conserved upstream open reading frame (uORF) in zip-2, enabling rapid ZIP-2 production and nuclear activation of defense genes, including the infection response genes irg-1 and irg-2. ZIP-2 operates in the intestinal epithelium and intersects with PMK-1/p38 MAPK and FSHR-1 signaling, as well as with C/EBP-family factors (CEBP-1/CEBP-2) and the NIPI-3 intestinal surveillance pathway. Recent work (2024) shows mechanistic distinctions between initiation versus elongation inhibition with differential ZIP-2 dependence and host survival outcomes. A 2020 study identified P. aeruginosa-mediated cleavage of host ribosomal helix 69 (H69) in intestinal ribosomes that activates the ZIP-2 pathway, further solidifying its role in translation-surveillance immunity (dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 1-2, dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 2-3, mcewan2012hosttranslationalinhibition pages 2-3, ghosh2024translationinitiationor pages 2-5).

*Table: Compact summary table of key studies reporting mechanisms, assays, targets/interactions, and DOIs for C. elegans ZIP-2 (UniProt Q21148); citations reference the available context IDs used to compile the entries.*

1) Key concepts and definitions
• Identity and family: ZIP-2 (UniProt Q21148; gene K02F3.4) is a bZIP transcription factor aligned with the C/EBP/ATF family, consistent with UniProt domain annotation and thesis-based family comparisons (bZIP/C/EBP) (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94).
• Core concept—translation-surveillance immunity: ZIP-2 mediates a branch of innate immunity that detects pathogen-induced translational inhibition. A conserved uORF in the zip-2 5′ UTR represses ZIP-2 under basal conditions; translational inhibition derepresses ZIP-2 synthesis to induce antimicrobial and detoxification programs, classically including irg-1 and irg-2 (dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 1-2, dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 2-3).
• Cellular site of action: The relevant physiological context is the intestinal epithelium, where infection and translational inhibition occur and where ribosome damage and ZIP-2-dependent responses are observed (dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 1-2, mcewan2012hosttranslationalinhibition pages 2-3).

2) Primary function, mechanism, domains, and localization
• Function: Transcriptional activator of early innate immune and toxin-defense genes in response to translational stress during infection. It is necessary for induction of the infection response program and promotes survival under specific translation-inhibition regimes (dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 1-2, mcewan2012hosttranslationalinhibition pages 2-3, ghosh2024translationinitiationor pages 2-5).
• Activation mechanism: Pathogen-secreted toxins (e.g., P. aeruginosa Exotoxin A) attenuate host translation, which derepresses the uORF control on zip-2, increasing ZIP-2 protein levels, enabling it to drive transcription of defense genes. Genetic and chemical inhibition of translation elongation (e.g., tRNA synthetase RNAi, eef-2 RNAi, cycloheximide) induces a ZIP-2-dependent irg-1 response (dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 2-3, dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 1-2).
• DNA/regulatory logic: While direct binding motifs for ZIP-2 are not detailed in these excerpts, the pathway induces irg-1 and irg-2 and is proposed to employ C/EBP-like DNA elements given ZIP-2’s family classification and potential dimerization with C/EBP proteins (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94, dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 1-2).
• Localization: Functional evidence places the activation and consequence of ZIP-2 signaling in the intestine; pathogen-triggered ribosome H69 cleavage and translational shutdown are predominantly intestinal, leading to activation of zip-2-mediated defense (mcewan2012hosttranslationalinhibition pages 2-3). Reporter studies show ZIP-2 protein accumulation post-infection, consistent with translational control (dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 1-2).

3) Downstream targets and pathway context
• Canonical target genes: irg-1 is a hallmark ZIP-2 target required for defense; irg-2 can be induced by translation inhibitors, sometimes with partial zip-2 independence, indicating parallel branches (dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 2-3, dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 1-2).
• Broader transcriptional program: Upon translation initiation inhibition, RNA-seq revealed a large ZIP-2-dependent gene set (1,054 upregulated genes), including innate immune and structural/cuticle genes, supporting a broad regulatory role (ghosh2024translationinitiationor pages 2-5).
• Pathway intersections: ZIP-2 acts with PMK-1/p38 and FSHR-1 to promote survival during Exotoxin A challenge, yet many infection-induced genes segregate into zip-2-dependent vs PMK-1-dependent cohorts, indicating partially parallel modules (mcewan2012hosttranslationalinhibition pages 2-3, dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 2-3). Intersections with the NIPI-3–CEBP-1 intestinal surveillance circuit and potential heterodimerization with CEBP-2 extend the regulatory network (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94).

4) Recent developments (2023–2024) and expert perspectives
• Initiation vs elongation inhibition: In 2024, differential survival outcomes were demonstrated—translation initiation inhibition improves survival via a ZIP-2-dependent protective program, while elongation inhibition diminishes survival and triggers mixed ZIP-2-dependent/independent responses (mBio, Nov 2024; DOI: 10.1128/mbio.02485-24) (ghosh2024translationinitiationor pages 2-5).
• Surveillance-immunity synthesis: A 2024 review integrates ZIP-2/irg-1 signaling into conserved surveillance mechanisms (translation, mitochondria, lysosomal organelles) within P. aeruginosa–C. elegans host–pathogen models, underscoring translational surveillance as a unifying concept (IJMS, Jun 2024; DOI: 10.3390/ijms25137034) (ghosh2024translationinitiationor pages 2-5).
• Ribosome damage as trigger: Ribosomal H69 cleavage by virulent P. aeruginosa isolates in the intestine activates the zip-2 pathway, connecting pathogen virulence strategies to host translation surveillance (PLoS Biol, Dec 2020; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000969) (mcewan2012hosttranslationalinhibition pages 2-3).

5) Genetic interactions and network integration
• PMK-1/p38 MAPK: Protection from Exotoxin A requires PMK-1 alongside ZIP-2 and FSHR-1, but specific infection-responsive genes partition into PMK-1- vs ZIP-2-dominant cohorts, indicating parallel or convergent branches (mcewan2012hosttranslationalinhibition pages 2-3, dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 2-3).
• FSHR-1: Contributes to protection during translational toxin exposure in coordination with ZIP-2 and PMK-1 (mcewan2012hosttranslationalinhibition pages 2-3).
• CEBP-1 and NIPI-3: An intestinal surveillance pathway configured by NIPI-3 (Tribbles ortholog) and CEBP-1 intersects bZIP immunity; CEBP-1 negatively regulated by NIPI-3 modulates immune gene expression, suggesting crosstalk with ZIP-2-regulated programs (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94).
• CEBP-2: High-throughput binding and genetic data suggest potential ZIP-2–CEBP-2 partnership, consistent with C/EBP-family dimerization logic (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94).
• ZIP-1: Another bZIP TF governing the intracellular pathogen response (IPR) is mentioned contextually in reviews; excerpts here emphasize ZIP-2’s extracellular bacterial toxin/translation surveillance role rather than IPR per se (ghosh2024translationinitiationor pages 2-5).

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
• Model of toxin-triggered immunity: ZIP-2 and irg-1 reporters are used as sensitive readouts of translational stress and pathogen toxin activity in vivo, enabling screening of bacterial effectors and host translation/defense modifiers (mcewan2012hosttranslationalinhibition pages 2-3, dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 1-2).
• Dissecting translation-pathway perturbations: Differential manipulation of initiation vs elongation is now a research tool to parse protective vs detrimental immune transcriptional programs and to identify ZIP-2-dependent gene networks underlying survival outcomes (ghosh2024translationinitiationor pages 2-5).

7) Expert opinions
• Surveillance immunity concept: Perspective pieces argue that detection of pathogen-induced translational inhibition constitutes a distinct, pathogen-specific branch of innate immunity, with ZIP-2 as a mechanistic exemplar; the uORF-regulation of zip-2 is highlighted as an elegant switch coupling translation status to immune activation (Future Microbiol, Oct 2012; DOI: 10.2217/fmb.12.91) (dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 2-3).
• Systems view of host–pathogen interactions: Reviews integrate ZIP-2 within broader surveillance frameworks spanning translation, mitochondrial stress, and neuroendocrine control of intestinal immunity (IJMS, Jun 2024; DOI: 10.3390/ijms25137034) (ghosh2024translationinitiationor pages 2-5).

8) Quantitative statistics and data points
• ToxA response transcriptome: 174 genes identified as ToxA-responsive (144 up, 30 down), with 68 overlapping early P. aeruginosa infection-induced genes, demonstrating partial recapitulation of infection transcriptional programs by translational inhibition (Cell Host & Microbe, Apr 2012; DOI: 10.1016/j.chom.2012.02.007) (mcewan2012hosttranslationalinhibition pages 2-3).
• Scope of ZIP-2 regulation under initiation blockade: 1,054 upregulated genes were ZIP-2-dependent in the initiation-inhibition condition, expanding the breadth of ZIP-2’s regulatory reach beyond canonical irg targets (mBio, Nov 2024; DOI: 10.1128/mbio.02485-24) (ghosh2024translationinitiationor pages 2-5).
• Tissue specificity of ribosome damage: Ribosome H69 cleavage during PA14 infection is predominantly intestinal, aligning mechanistically with intestinal ZIP-2 pathway activation (PLoS Biol, Dec 2020; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000969) (mcewan2012hosttranslationalinhibition pages 2-3).

9) Open questions and future directions
• Direct DNA-binding targets and motif grammar: While irg-1/irg-2 dependence is established, comprehensive ZIP-2 ChIP-seq or motif definition for C. elegans promoters under infection would clarify direct targets versus secondary effects (dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 1-2, dunbar2012c.elegansdetects pages 2-3).
• Intersections with NIPI-3/CEBP-1/CEBP-2: The precise composition of ZIP-2 complexes and their epistasis with the NIPI-3–CEBP axis during translational stress remain to be mapped in detail (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94).
• Context dependence of initiation versus elongation stress: The protective vs detrimental consequences across pathogens and environmental stresses warrant systematic dissection across tissues and developmental stages (ghosh2024translationinitiationor pages 2-5).

Verification of identity and domains
We verified that the studied gene is C. elegans zip-2 (K02F3.4), a bZIP transcription factor in the C/EBP-related family, matching UniProt Q21148 and the presence of bZIP/C/EBP domain features. No conflicting gene symbol usage was encountered in the retrieved literature (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94).
