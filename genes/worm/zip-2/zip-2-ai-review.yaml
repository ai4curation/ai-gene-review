description: ZIP-2 is a bZIP transcription factor of the C/EBP subfamily that plays
  a central role in C. elegans surveillance immunity. It functions as a key mediator
  of the host response to translational inhibition caused by pathogen-derived toxins,
  particularly P. aeruginosa Exotoxin A. ZIP-2 acts together with CEBP-2 to activate
  infection response genes including irg-1 and irg-2. The protein is also part of
  the ESRE (Ethanol and Stress Response Element) network that responds to mitochondrial
  damage. ZIP-2 is induced by P. aeruginosa infection and by translational inhibitors
  such as cycloheximide. Loss of zip-2 results in decreased survival upon P. aeruginosa
  infection and reduced induction of infection response genes.

    label: RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: ZIP-2 is a bZIP transcription factor that binds DNA to regulate transcription
      of target genes including infection response genes (irg-1, irg-2). The bZIP
      domain (aa 242-305) contains a basic motif (aa 246-276) and leucine-zipper (aa
      277-291) characteristic of sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is phylogenetically supported and consistent with ZIP-2's
      demonstrated role as a transcription factor that regulates expression of specific
      target genes. UniProt notes that ZIP-2 "binds to the promoter and the enhancer
      regions of target genes" (by similarity). The presence of a canonical bZIP domain
      with basic motif supports DNA binding function.

      is phylogenetically supported and consistent with experimental evidence showing

    action: ACCEPT

      PMID:26876169 shows CEBP-2 and ZIP-2 "act together" in surveillance immunity.
      However, "protein binding" is too generic for bZIP dimerization. A more informative
