description: 'IRE-1 is a conserved ER transmembrane stress sensor with dual enzymatic
  activities: a serine/threonine protein kinase and an endoribonuclease. The core
  function is sensing unfolded proteins in the ER lumen and transducing this signal
  to the cytosol through trans-autophosphorylation of its kinase domain, which activates
  its RNase domain to catalyze unconventional cytoplasmic splicing of xbp-1 mRNA,
  generating the active XBP-1s transcription factor that induces UPR target genes.
  IRE-1 also executes Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay (RIDD) of select mRNAs including
  daf-7. The protein localizes to the ER membrane as a type I single-pass transmembrane
  protein with a luminal stress-sensing domain and cytosolic kinase-RNase effector
  domains. IRE-1 acts in one of three parallel UPR-ER branches (with PEK-1 and ATF-6),
  showing synthetic lethality with loss of a second branch. Neuronal IRE-1 also mediates
  cell-nonautonomous signaling including germline apoptosis regulation and anticipatory
  stress responses.'

      summary: IRE-1 is an ER-localized protein. UniProt and experimental 
        evidence from PMID:11779465 confirm ER membrane localization. This 
        annotation is correct but the more specific term GO:0005789 (endoplasmic

        protein.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: IRE-1 localizes to the ER as confirmed by multiple sources 
        including UniProt subcellular location annotation. While GO:0005789 (ER 
        membrane) is more precise, this broader term is acceptable for IBA-level

  - question: How does IRE-1 achieve different activation thresholds for xbp-1

      than xbp-1 splicing, suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms.
