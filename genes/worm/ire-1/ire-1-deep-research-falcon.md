### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ire-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ire-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ire-1** (gene ID: ire-1, UniProt: Q09499) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: We are analyzing Caenorhabditis elegans ire-1 (UniProt Q09499), annotated as a serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease IRE-1 precursor. The protein is an ER-resident, single-pass transmembrane sensor with cytosolic kinase and RNase domains. This matches the literature for C. elegans IRE-1, including its conserved topology and bifunctional catalytic activities (kinase and endoribonuclease) that mediate xbp-1 mRNA splicing and regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) (richardson2011investigatingtherole pages 110-118, ying2023theriddactivity pages 1-4). The organismal context is C. elegans, and the functional family/domain assignments align with IRE1-like kinases/RNases reported in nematodes (richardson2011investigatingtherole pages 110-118, ying2023theriddactivity pages 1-4).

Key concepts and definitions
- Unfolded Protein Response of the ER (UPR-ER): In metazoa, the UPR-ER is mediated by three branches—IRE-1 (ire-1), PERK/PEK-1 (pek-1), and ATF-6 (atf-6). IRE-1 oligomerizes upon accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, activating a cytosolic RNase that splices xbp-1 mRNA to generate the active transcription factor XBP-1s, while PERK/PEK-1 phosphorylates eIF2α to attenuate translation, and ATF-6 functions as a transcription factor following ER-to-Golgi trafficking and proteolysis (richardson2011investigatingtherole pages 110-118). IRE-1 also executes RIDD, degrading select mRNAs to reduce ER client load and tune signaling outputs (xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 1-2, ying2023theriddactivity pages 1-4).
- ire-1 gene product: A type I single-pass ER transmembrane protein with a luminal stress-sensing domain and cytosolic serine/threonine kinase and endoribonuclease domains. In C. elegans and heterologous systems, the kinase activity is required for RNase function, and species-specific linkers modulate activity and temperature dependence (ying2023theriddactivity pages 7-9, ying2023theriddactivity pages 1-4).

Mechanistic function: enzymology, substrates, and localization
- Catalytic modalities: IRE-1’s RNase has two outputs: (i) non-conventional cytoplasmic splicing of xbp-1 mRNA to produce XBP-1s; and (ii) regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of select ER-targeted mRNAs (richardson2011investigatingtherole pages 110-118, xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 1-2, ying2023theriddactivity pages 1-4).
- Substrate specificity and new targets: In C. elegans, recent work identifies daf-7 (a TGFβ family ligand expressed in ASI neurons) as a physiological RIDD substrate whose mRNA is selectively degraded under conditions where xbp-1 splicing is not detectably induced, indicating different activation thresholds and a signaling role for RIDD independent of canonical splicing (bioRxiv preprint, posted Aug 16, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.10.552841) (ying2023theriddactivity pages 1-4, ying2023theriddactivity pages 15-17, ying2023theriddactivity pages 17-20). Cross-species cleavage shows conservation of RNase recognition: C. elegans IRE-1 processes mammalian Xbp1, and human IRE1 cleaves C. elegans xbp-1; a chimeric human–worm IRE1 confirms conserved RNase outputs, with RIDD toward Blos1 (in heterologous cells) and temperature-tuned activity (ying2023theriddactivity pages 7-9).
- Kinetic/biophysical constraints: RNase activity depends on kinase function (kinase-dead G723R abolishes xbp-1 splicing and RIDD), and a species-matched linker is necessary for efficient catalysis. The C. elegans catalytic domains in chimeras show high activity at 25°C, achieving up to ~80% Xbp1 splicing; human IRE1 is largely inactive at 25°C, highlighting temperature adaptation of the catalytic core (ying2023theriddactivity pages 7-9).
- Cellular localization: IRE-1 is a single-pass ER membrane protein; stress-dependent oligomerization at the ER mediates activation. This conserved topology underlies signal transduction from the ER lumen to the cytosolic kinase/RNase effector domains (richardson2011investigatingtherole pages 110-118, ying2023theriddactivity pages 1-4).

Pathways, genetic interactions, and tissue physiology
- Canonical UPR-ER wiring in C. elegans: In somatic tissues, activation of the UPR-ER reporter hsp-4 under replication stress caused by depletion of DNA primase subunits (pri-1/pri-2) depends completely on ire-1 and xbp-1, whereas embryos exhibit partial rerouting with atf-6-dependent hsp-4 induction. Loss of ire-1 or pek-1 sensitizes animals to hydroxyurea-induced replication stress, indicating functional contributions of both branches to genome integrity under stress (G3, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkae017) (xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 4-5, xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 1-2).
- Redundancy and essentiality: Single-branch mutants (ire-1, pek-1, atf-6) are viable but ER-stress sensitive; combining loss of two branches (e.g., ire-1/xbp-1 with atf-6 or pek-1) causes early larval arrest. XBP-1 deficiency imposes constitutive ER stress with elevated basal IRE-1 and PEK-1 activities, and the requirement for XBP-1 and PEK-1 rises with immune activation and higher temperatures, supporting a constitutive role of UPR-ER in development and homeostasis (PLoS Genet, Nov 2011; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002391) (richardson2011investigatingtherole pages 110-118).
- Crosstalk with innate immunity and oxidative stress: During infection with Enterococcus faecalis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, IRE-1 is required for activation of the SKN-1 (Nrf) antioxidant program, in part via a p38 MAPK axis. Perturbation of ERAD via cdc-48 RNAi triggers ER stress, sequestering IRE-1 into canonical UPR, reducing PMK-1 phosphorylation and compromising SKN-1 target induction (Genetics, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyae131) (gabaldon2024skn1activationduring pages 6-8).
- Neuronal IRE-1 and anticipatory neuroendocrine signaling: Neuronal RIDD of daf-7 in ASI neurons modulates dauer-associated programs and improves survival under anticipated stress (low-dose ER stressor exposure and elevated temperature). Low tunicamycin doses that do not detectably induce xbp-1 splicing suffice to engage RIDD and adjust endocrine outputs, emphasizing a physiological role for RIDD beyond bulk proteostasis (bioRxiv, Aug 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.10.552841) (ying2023theriddactivity pages 1-4, ying2023theriddactivity pages 15-17, ying2023theriddactivity pages 17-20).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- RIDD program and daf-7 targeting in vivo: Ying et al. (preprint, 2023) demonstrate temperature-tuned, kinase-dependent RNase activity and identify daf-7 as a neuronal RIDD target; pre-emptive low tunicamycin improves population survival at 27°C by more than two-fold, and RIDD occurs at doses below the threshold for detectable xbp-1 splicing, supporting separable activation thresholds for RIDD and splicing (posted Aug 16, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.10.552841) (ying2023theriddactivity pages 15-17, ying2023theriddactivity pages 7-9, ying2023theriddactivity pages 1-4).
- UPR-ER engagement by DNA replication stress: Xu et al. (G3, 2024) report that primase depletion triggers UPR-ER with branch-specific genetics: somatic induction requires ire-1/xbp-1, while embryos rely on atf-6; functional assays reveal that ire-1 loss sensitizes to HU, linking UPR-ER to genome integrity under replication fork stress (Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkae017) (xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 4-5, xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 1-2).
- Immunity and stress crosstalk: Gabaldón et al. (Genetics, 2024) show IRE-1 is required for SKN-1 activation during infection; ERAD disruption diverts IRE-1 toward canonical UPR, diminishing p38/SKN-1 signaling—an insight into how finite IRE-1 pool allocation coordinates stress responses (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyae131) (gabaldon2024skn1activationduring pages 6-8).

Current applications and real-world implementations in C. elegans
- Reporter-based UPR-ER monitoring: phsp-4::GFP remains a canonical reporter for ire-1/xbp-1 activity in soma; Xu et al. use it to genetically dissect branch-specific regulation across tissues and stresses (xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 4-5, xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 1-2).
- Stress-preconditioning paradigms: Low-dose tunicamycin pre-exposure (100–300× below standard doses) engages neuronal IRE-1 RIDD to tune neuroendocrine outputs (daf-7), translating into improved population expansion/survival at elevated temperature—an experimental framework to probe anticipatory stress signaling (ying2023theriddactivity pages 15-17).
- Infection models: Pathogen exposure (E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa) coupled with genetic perturbations (ire-1, cdc-48/ERAD) elucidates how IRE-1 coordinates UPR-ER with p38/SKN-1 antioxidant responses, informing study designs on immunity-proteostasis tradeoffs (gabaldon2024skn1activationduring pages 6-8).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Branch redundancy and essentiality: Richardson et al. underscore that while any single UPR-ER branch can be dispensable for viability, the system’s integrated function is essential, as dual-branch defects cause early lethality, pointing to distributed, compensatory control of ER homeostasis across development and immunity (richardson2011investigatingtherole pages 110-118).
- RIDD as a physiological signaling modality: Ying et al. propose that RIDD has a neuron-centric, anticipatory role that calibrates endocrine outputs without overt UPR transcriptional remodeling, thereby extending IRE-1’s role beyond proteostasis to circuit-level adaptation (ying2023theriddactivity pages 1-4, ying2023theriddactivity pages 17-20).
- Stress response allocation: Gabaldón et al. interpret ERAD loss as a perturbation that reallocates IRE-1 from SKN-1 activation to canonical UPR, supporting a model where IRE-1 is a limiting node coordinating multiple stress axes (gabaldon2024skn1activationduring pages 6-8).

Relevant statistics and data
- Temperature-tuned xbp-1 splicing: In human cells expressing worm catalytic domains, up to ~80% Xbp1 splicing occurred at 25°C; RNase inhibitor 4μ8C blocked activity and increased RIDD substrate levels (ying2023theriddactivity pages 7-9).
- RIDD metrics: Blos1 mRNA decreased ~25% upon thapsigargin at 25°C; 4μ8C increased Blos1 by ~50%, and a kinase-dead IRE-1 mutant abrogated both splicing and RIDD (ying2023theriddactivity pages 7-9).
- daf-7 regulation: daf-7 log2 fold-change after tunicamycin ~−0.53 in N2 (ire-1 KO ~+0.31), indicating ire-1–dependent RIDD; low-dose tunicamycin preconditioning increased population size >2× at 27°C (ying2023theriddactivity pages 17-20, ying2023theriddactivity pages 15-17).
- Replication stress outcomes: Loss of ire-1 or pek-1 sensitized animals to HU-induced replication stress; somatic hsp-4 induction required ire-1/xbp-1 while embryonic induction depended on atf-6 (xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 4-5).

Conclusions
C. elegans ire-1 (Q09499) encodes a conserved ER stress sensor with dual catalytic activities that orchestrate both the canonical xbp-1 splicing pathway and RIDD. Recent work in 2023–2024 extends its roles beyond proteostasis into anticipatory neuroendocrine signaling (RIDD of daf-7) and cross-compartment stress coordination (UPR-ER responses to replication stress; allocation between UPR and SKN-1-mediated antioxidant defenses). Tissue- and context-specific wiring is evident: soma relies on ire-1/xbp-1 for UPR induction under replication stress, while embryos utilize atf-6; infection and ERAD perturbations reveal an IRE-1 bottleneck that coordinates stress-response priorities. Together, these studies refine our understanding of IRE-1 as both a proteostasis maintainer and a systems-level regulator of developmental and immune physiology in nematodes (xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 4-5, gabaldon2024skn1activationduring pages 6-8, richardson2011investigatingtherole pages 110-118, ying2023theriddactivity pages 15-17).
