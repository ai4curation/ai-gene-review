description: 'CSR-1 (Chromosome Segregation and RNAi deficient-1) is the only singly
  essential Argonaute protein in C. elegans out of the 24 Argonaute family members
  encoded in the genome. CSR-1 binds 22G-RNAs that are antisense to thousands of germline-expressed
  protein-coding genes (approximately 25% of all protein-coding genes) and plays essential
  roles in chromosome segregation, germline gene protection from piRNA-mediated silencing,
  and transgenerational epigenetic memory. The gene encodes two isoforms: CSR-1A (spermatogenesis-specific,
  with an additional 163 amino acids at the N-terminus) and CSR-1B (ubiquitously expressed
  in the germline). CSR-1 localizes to P granules and chromosomes, where it functions
  with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase EGO-1, Dicer-related helicase DRH-3, and Tudor-domain
  protein EKL-1 to organize holocentric chromosomes for proper mitotic and meiotic
  division. Loss of CSR-1 causes metaphase alignment failure, kinetochore orientation
  defects, and embryonic lethality.

  CRITICAL DATA ISSUE - The original GOA file (csr-1-goa.tsv) and UniProt file (csr-1-uniprot.txt)
  contain data for the WRONG gene. They describe nhr-47 (Q17370), a nuclear hormone
  receptor, NOT csr-1 (Q21992), the essential Argonaute protein. This appears to be
  due to csr-1 being listed as an old synonym for nhr-47 in some databases. All annotations
  from the original files have been marked for REMOVAL. New annotations have been
  added based on the actual CSR-1 Argonaute literature (PMID:19804758, PMID:24360782).
  The data files should be regenerated with the correct UniProt ID Q21992.'

      summary: This annotation is for nhr-47 (Q17370), a nuclear hormone 
        receptor, NOT for csr-1 (Q21992), the Argonaute protein. The original 
        data files contain incorrect gene mapping. CSR-1 is an Argonaute/RISC 
        component that binds RNA, not a DNA-binding transcription factor.

      reason: Gene identity error. The GOA file incorrectly maps to nhr-47 
        (Q17370) instead of the true CSR-1 Argonaute (Q21992). CSR-1 does not 
        have DNA-binding transcription factor activity; it is an RNA-binding

        supporting_text: the CSR-1-interacting small RNAs (22G-RNAs) are 
          antisense to thousands of germline-expressed protein-coding genes

        supporting_text: C. elegans CSR-1 argonaute pathway counteracts 
          epigenetic silencing to promote germline gene expression
proposed_new_terms: []
suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the precise mechanism by which CSR-1 binding to 
      chromosomes promotes proper kinetochore assembly and chromosome alignment?
  - question: How do the two CSR-1 isoforms (CSR-1A and CSR-1B) differentially 
      regulate spermatogenesis versus oogenesis?
  - question: What determines whether a gene becomes a CSR-1 target versus a 
      piRNA target for silencing?
suggested_experiments:
  - description: ChIP-seq or CUT&RUN to map CSR-1 binding sites on chromosomes 
      during mitosis and meiosis, correlated with kinetochore assembly markers. 
      Would provide mechanistic insight into how CSR-1 promotes proper 
      chromosome organization.
  - description: Isoform-specific rescue experiments to determine which CSR-1 
      isoform is required for chromosome segregation versus germline gene 
      protection. Would clarify whether the essential chromosome segregation 
      function is shared between isoforms or specific to one.
