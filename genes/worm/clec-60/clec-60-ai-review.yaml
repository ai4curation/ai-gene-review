description: CLEC-60 is a secreted C-type lectin domain-containing protein with a
  von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain that functions as an antimicrobial effector
  molecule in C. elegans innate immunity. It is strongly upregulated (8.3-fold) in
  intestinal epithelial cells during Staphylococcus aureus infection and is part of
  the host defense response to Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. CLEC-60 is expressed
  in the intestine and is induced by multiple pathogens including S. aureus, P. aeruginosa,
  and M. nematophilum. Overexpression of the clec-60,61 gene cluster confers enhanced
  survival during S. aureus infection, demonstrating a protective role in antibacterial
  defense. The protein contains a signal peptide suggesting it is secreted, consistent
  with a role as an antimicrobial effector that may directly interact with or agglutinate
  pathogen surface molecules via its C-type lectin domain.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is well-supported by experimental evidence from PMID:20617181.
      The study demonstrates that clec-60 is strongly induced (8.3-fold) during S.
      aureus (Gram-positive) infection in C. elegans intestinal epithelial cells.
      The IGI evidence is based on the observation that overexpression of the clec-60,61
      gene cluster (with clec-61/Q23565 as the With/From gene) confers increased survival
      during S. aureus infection (LT50 = 54.2 h vs 47.3 h for controls, p = 0.019).
      This demonstrates a functional protective role in defense against Gram-positive
      bacteria.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The annotation accurately reflects the experimentally demonstrated function
      of CLEC-60 in defense against Gram-positive bacteria. The evidence from PMID:20617181
      shows both transcriptional induction during S. aureus infection and functional
      protection via overexpression studies. The C-type lectin domain is consistent
      with carbohydrate-binding activity that could recognize pathogen-associated
      molecular patterns on bacterial surfaces. This represents a core function for
      this antimicrobial effector protein.

  review:
    summary: 'CLEC-60 contains a C-type lectin-like domain (CDD: cd00037, InterPro:
      IPR001304, SMART: SM00034) as identified by domain prediction algorithms. C-type
      lectin domains are characterized by their calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding
      activity. The domain architecture supports the predicted carbohydrate binding
      function, which would be consistent with recognition of pathogen surface carbohydrates
      as part of its antimicrobial function.'
    action: NEW
    reason: While not explicitly present in the GOA file, the carbohydrate binding
      activity is strongly supported by the domain composition of CLEC-60. The UniProt
      record shows C-type lectin domain annotations from multiple sources (CDD, Gene3D,
      InterPro, PANTHER, SMART, SUPFAM). This molecular function is mechanistically
      linked to its biological role in pathogen recognition and defense. C-type lectins
      typically bind carbohydrates in a calcium-dependent manner and can recognize
      pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as bacterial cell wall components.

  review:
    summary: CLEC-60 functions as an effector of the innate immune response to bacterial
      infection. The protein is transcriptionally induced during infection by multiple
      bacterial pathogens and overexpression confers protection against S. aureus
      killing. This represents a broader characterization of its innate immune function.
    action: NEW
    reason: 'The evidence from PMID:20617181 demonstrates that CLEC-60 is part of
      the C. elegans innate immune response to bacterial infection. The study shows:
      (1) transcriptional induction during S. aureus and M. nematophilum infection,
      (2) expression in intestinal epithelial cells which represent the host''s first
      line of defense, (3) protective effect of overexpression on host survival, and
      (4) the protein contains a signal peptide consistent with secretion as an antimicrobial
      effector. GO:0140367 (antibacterial innate immune response) appropriately captures
      this broader immune function.'

  review:
    summary: CLEC-60 contains a signal peptide (residues 1-17) as predicted by SignalP,
      indicating secretion to the extracellular space. This is consistent with its
      proposed role as a secreted antimicrobial effector molecule.
    action: NEW
    reason: The UniProt record shows a predicted signal peptide at residues 1-17,
      strongly suggesting that CLEC-60 is a secreted protein. This cellular component
      annotation is important for understanding its function as an extracellular antimicrobial
      effector that would encounter pathogens in the intestinal lumen.

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the specific carbohydrate ligand recognized by CLEC-60? Does it
    bind peptidoglycan or lipoteichoic acid components of Gram-positive bacterial
    cell walls? Understanding the molecular target would provide insight into the
    mechanism of pathogen recognition and potential specificity for Gram-positive
    vs Gram-negative bacteria.
- question: Is CLEC-60 directly bactericidal/bacteriostatic, or does it function primarily
    through agglutination/opsonization of bacteria? The mechanism of antimicrobial
    action is not established. C-type lectins can function through various mechanisms
    including direct killing, agglutination, or recruitment of other immune effectors.
- question: What is the functional relationship between CLEC-60 and the closely related
    CLEC-61 and CLEC-62 proteins in the same gene cluster? The genes appear to be
    co-regulated and overexpression of the cluster confers protection. Understanding
    their individual vs collective contributions would clarify functional redundancy.
suggested_experiments:
- description: Single-gene RNAi knockdown of clec-60 alone (vs the cluster) to determine
    whether it is individually required for defense against S. aureus infection. If
    clec-60 is required, RNAi should result in increased susceptibility to S. aureus
    killing compared to control animals.
  hypothesis: clec-60 knockdown will increase susceptibility to S. aureus infection
- description: Recombinant CLEC-60 protein binding assays with purified Gram-positive
    bacterial cell wall components (peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid) vs Gram-negative
    components (LPS). This would reveal ligand specificity and whether the protein
    preferentially recognizes Gram-positive bacterial surfaces.
  hypothesis: CLEC-60 preferentially binds Gram-positive bacterial cell wall components
- description: In vitro antimicrobial activity assays with purified recombinant CLEC-60
    against S. aureus and other bacteria. This would determine whether CLEC-60 has
    direct bactericidal/bacteriostatic activity or functions through other mechanisms.
  hypothesis: CLEC-60 has direct antimicrobial activity against S. aureus
