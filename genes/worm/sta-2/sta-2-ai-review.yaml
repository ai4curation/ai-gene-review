description: STA-2 is a STAT-like transcription factor that serves as a key regulator
  of epidermal innate immunity in C. elegans. Unlike classical STAT proteins in vertebrates,
  STA-2 is activated through an unconventional mechanism involving the SLC6 transporter
  SNF-12 rather than JAK kinases (which are absent in C. elegans). STA-2 is normally
  sequestered at hemidesmosomes in the epidermis, and structural damage or fungal
  infection triggers its release and nuclear translocation, where it activates antimicrobial
  peptide gene expression (particularly nlp-29). STA-2 functions downstream of the
  p38 MAPK (pmk-1) pathway and acts cell-autonomously in the epidermis. Additionally,
  STA-2 participates in ECM-to-nucleus signaling during larval development, where
  it works with ELT-3 to activate lysosomal V-ATPase expression at molts.

  review:
    summary: STA-2 localizes to the cytoplasm as well as other compartments. Phylogenetic
      inference from STAT family members supports cytoplasmic localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: STAT proteins shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus. STA-2 is present
      in cytoplasmic compartments and translocates to the nucleus upon activation.
      IBA annotation is appropriate for a conserved STAT family member.

      phylogenetic inference is well-supported by experimental data showing sta-2
      is essential for antimicrobial peptide induction.
    action: ACCEPT

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This annotation is inferred from phylogenetic relationship to mammalian
      STATs which regulate cell proliferation. However, there is no experimental evidence
      that STA-2 regulates cell proliferation in C. elegans. The published literature
      focuses on its role in immunity and developmental processes (molting).
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While mammalian STATs are established regulators of proliferation, C.
      elegans STA-2 has diverged to primarily function in innate immunity and developmental
      ECM signaling. No experimental evidence supports a proliferation role for STA-2.
      This annotation may reflect ancestral STAT function but is not a characterized
      function of this protein.

  evidence_type: IBA

  review:
    summary: This annotation is problematic because C. elegans lacks JAK kinases.
      While STA-2 is a STAT family member, it is activated through an unconventional
      mechanism involving the SLC6 transporter SNF-12 rather than JAK-mediated signaling
      (PMID:21575913). The title of PMID:21575913 explicitly states "Unusual regulation
      of a STAT protein."
    action: REMOVE
    reason: C. elegans does not have JAK kinases, and STA-2 is not regulated by the
      classical JAK-STAT pathway. This IBA annotation incorrectly transfers a mammalian
      signaling mechanism to a nematode protein that uses a fundamentally different
      activation mechanism (via SNF-12 transporter and hemidesmosomes).

    specific cis-regulatory elements it binds have not been characterized in C. elegans.
- question: Does STA-2 interact with other transcription factors besides ELT-3? ELT-3
    cooperates with STA-2 during molting, but other co-factors in the immune response
    may exist.
- question: What is the mechanism of STA-2 release from hemidesmosomes upon damage?
    The molecular details of how structural damage leads to STA-2 release and activation
    are not fully understood.
