description: BBS-5 is a core component of the BBSome complex in C. elegans, required
  for intraflagellar transport (IFT) assembly and turnaround in cilia. The protein
  contains two PH-like domains (DM16 domains) predicted to bind phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate.
  BBS-5 functions redundantly with BBS-4 in ciliogenesis, IFT protein assembly, and
  movement along the ciliary axoneme. The BBSome assembles IFT complexes at the ciliary
  base and regulates IFT recycling at the ciliary tip. BBS-5 also plays a role in
  the removal of degraded mechanosensory receptors from cilia. Single bbs-5 mutants
  show no obvious ciliogenesis defects, but double bbs-5/bbs-4 mutants display severe
  defects in cilia structure, IFT protein localization, and ciliary signaling.

  review:
    summary: BBS-5 is established as a core component of the BBSome complex based
      on phylogenetic inference from well-characterized human and mouse orthologs.
      The BBSome in C. elegans contains bbs-1, bbs-2, bbs-4, bbs-5, osm-12, bbs-8/ttc-8,
      and bbs-9 (UniProt Q21626). The BBSome functions as a coat complex for sorting
      membrane proteins to primary cilia (PMID:22922713).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core BBSome membership is strongly supported by phylogenetic analysis
      and direct experimental evidence in C. elegans showing BBS-5 functions together
      with other BBSome components.

  review:
    summary: BBS-5 is required for cilium assembly, functioning redundantly with BBS-4.
      While single bbs-5 mutants do not display obvious ciliogenesis defects, double
      bbs-5/bbs-4 mutants show defective cilia structure (PMID:26150102). The BBSome
      controls IFT assembly which is essential for ciliogenesis (PMID:22922713).

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: BBS-5 contains two PH-like domains (DM16 domains, SMART SM00683) that
      are predicted to bind phosphatidylinositol phosphates. The IBA annotation is
      based on phylogenetic inference from human BBS5 (Q8N3I7), which has been shown
      to have PI3P binding activity through its DM16 domains.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The presence of two DM16/PH-like domains in BBS-5 supports the PI3P binding
      function. This is a well-conserved molecular function across BBS5 family members
      and is likely important for membrane association at the ciliary base.

  review:
    summary: BBS-5 localizes to the ciliary basal body based on phylogenetic inference.
      This localization is consistent with the role of the BBSome in assembling IFT
      complexes at the ciliary base (PMID:22922713) and direct experimental evidence
      in C. elegans (PMID:15137946).

  review:
    summary: Cytoplasmic localization is inferred from UniProtKB subcellular location
      annotation. BBS-5 is present in the cytoplasm when not associated with ciliary
      structures, consistent with its role in assembling IFT complexes before transport
      into cilia.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a general but accurate localization. BBS-5 resides in the cytoplasm
      before being recruited to the ciliary base for IFT assembly. While less specific
      than ciliary localizations, it is not incorrect.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: BBS-5 is involved in protein transport as part of the BBSome complex,
      which functions in sorting and trafficking membrane proteins to cilia. The BBSome
      regulates IFT assembly and turnaround, which are essential for protein transport
      along ciliary axonemes (PMID:22922713).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While protein transport is accurate, a more specific term reflecting the
      ciliary transport function would be more informative. The annotation should
      be modified to reflect the specific role in intraflagellar transport or ciliary
      protein trafficking.

  review:
    summary: Centriolar satellite localization is inferred from UniProtKB subcellular
      location based on similarity to human BBS5. The UniProt record states that the
      BBSome is dispensable for centriolar satellite function (by similarity), suggesting
      this may not be a primary localization site in C. elegans.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: While human BBS5 localizes to centriolar satellites, it is unclear if
      this is a significant localization for C. elegans BBS-5. The UniProt record
      notes the BBSome is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. More direct
      experimental evidence in C. elegans would be needed to confirm this localization.
