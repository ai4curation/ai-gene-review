description: 'P granule abnormality protein 2 (PGL-2) is a temporally-restricted P granule component expressed only during postembryonic development in C. elegans germline. Unlike constitutive PGL-1/PGL-3 which have ribonuclease activity, PGL-2 functions primarily as an RNA-binding structural component without enzymatic activity. It participates in P granule assembly, post-transcriptional regulation, and germline development through protein-protein interactions with PGL-1 and PGL-3, but provides limited functional redundancy compared to the strong PGL-1/PGL-3 backup system.'

    label: cell differentiation
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation based on UniProtKB keyword mapping for differentiation. PGL-2 is involved in germline-specific processes and P granule assembly, which supports germ cell identity and prevents inappropriate somatic differentiation. However, this broad term does not capture PGL-2's specific role in postembryonic germline development.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While PGL-2 does contribute to maintaining germ cell identity and preventing inappropriate somatic differentiation through P granule function, the broad term 'cell differentiation' is too general. PGL-2 specifically functions in germline development and germ cell fate maintenance during postembryonic stages.

    label: oogenesis
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation based on UniProtKB keyword mapping for oogenesis. While PGL-2 is involved in germline development and fertility, its specific role is broader than just oogenesis - it functions in both male and female germline development and is essential for overall germ cell proliferation and maturation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation captures one aspect of PGL-2 function but is too narrow. PGL-2 functions in both male and female germline development. While oogenesis is one process PGL-2 supports, its core function is broader P granule assembly and post-transcriptional regulation that affects gametogenesis in both sexes. Keep as non-core since it represents only part of PGL-2's reproductive function.

  review:
    summary: Well-supported experimental annotation based on direct immunofluorescence and localization studies. PGL-2 is definitively localized to P granules during postembryonic development, as demonstrated by multiple experimental approaches including fluorescently tagged proteins.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is strongly supported by experimental evidence. The original reference (PMID:15238518) provides direct experimental demonstration of PGL-2 localization to P granules, and this has been confirmed by subsequent studies. P granule localization is a core characteristic of PGL-2.

    summary: PGL-2 participates in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression through its role in P granule-mediated mRNA regulation. P granules serve as hubs for translational control and RNA surveillance in germ cells.

    summary: PGL-2 functions in both male and female germline development. Loss-of-function studies show that PGL-2 contributes to fertility in both hermaphrodites and males, indicating involvement in spermatogenesis as well as oogenesis.
    action: NEW
