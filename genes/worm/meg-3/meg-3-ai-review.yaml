description: 'MEG-3 (Maternal-Effect Germline defective 3) is an intrinsically disordered
  protein (IDP) that serves as the primary scaffold for P granule (germ granule) assembly
  in C. elegans embryos. MEG-3 contains a serine-rich N-terminal intrinsically disordered
  region (IDR) and a C-terminal HMG-box domain. It drives liquid-liquid phase separation
  (LLPS) in an RNA-dependent manner, forming gel-like assemblies that stabilize liquid
  PGL-3 droplets. MEG-3 establishes a posterior-rich concentration gradient that is
  anti-correlated with MEX-5, which suppresses MEG-3 granule formation by competing
  for RNA binding. MEG-3 function is regulated by phosphorylation: it is a substrate
  of kinase MBK-2/DYRK (promotes disassembly) and phosphatase PP2A/PPTR-1/2 (promotes
  assembly). MEG-3 functions redundantly with MEG-4; double mutants fail to assemble
  P granules in early embryos but remain partially fertile (~70%). MEG-3 is essential
  for efficient RNA recruitment to germ granules and transmission of maternal nuage
  to primordial germ cells.'

  review:
    summary: MEG-3 is essential for P granule localization to the posterior of the
      embryo. PMID:25535836 demonstrates that MEG-3 forms a dynamic domain that surrounds
      and penetrates P granules, and that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles
      regulate granule dynamics. This annotation captures MEG-3's role in proper localization
      of P granules, though a more specific term for P granule localization might
      be preferred.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: MEG-3 establishes a posterior-rich concentration gradient that positions
      P granules correctly in the embryo. The Wang et al. 2014 study used lattice
      light sheet microscopy to show that GFP-tagged MEG-3 localizes to a dynamic
      domain that surrounds and penetrates each granule. The annotation accurately
      reflects MEG-3's role in controlling where P granules localize.

  review:
    summary: This is a core function annotation. MEG-3 is the primary driver of P
      granule assembly through liquid-liquid phase separation. The IGI evidence reflects
      genetic interactions with meg-4 (WBGene00016485) and other genes. MEG-3/MEG-4
      double mutants fail to assemble P granules in early embryos.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: P granule assembly is the defining core function of MEG-3. The Wang et
      al. 2014 study shows that MEG proteins are germ plasm components that are required
      redundantly for fertility and that they regulate RNA granule dynamics. The genetic
      interaction with meg-4 demonstrates functional redundancy in P granule assembly.

  evidence_type: IGI
  original_reference_id: PMID:25535836
  review:
    summary: This annotation reflects a downstream phenotype of MEG-3 function rather
      than a direct molecular function. MEG-3/MEG-4 double mutants show reduced fertility
      (~70% fertile), which correlates with germ cell proliferation defects. However,
      MEG-3's primary role is in P granule assembly, not direct regulation of germ
      cell proliferation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While meg-3 meg-4 double mutants show fertility defects, MEG-3's direct
      molecular function is P granule scaffold activity, not direct regulation of
      proliferation. The germ cell proliferation phenotype is a downstream consequence
      of defective P granule assembly and impaired germ plasm inheritance. This annotation
      is not incorrect but represents a non-core, secondary phenotype.

  review:
    summary: This annotation captures MEG-3's interactions with MBK-2 (UniProtKB:A9UJN4),
      PPTR-1 (UniProtKB:O18178), and PPTR-2 (UniProtKB:Q304E5). These are functionally
      important interactions for regulating MEG-3 phosphorylation status and P granule
      dynamics. However, 'protein binding' is too general; more specific terms should
      be used.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The protein binding annotation is too vague. MEG-3's interactions with
      MBK-2 kinase and PP2A phosphatase regulatory subunits PPTR-1/2 are functionally
      important for its regulation. A more informative annotation would be molecular
      condensate scaffold activity (GO:0140693), which captures MEG-3's true function
      in binding and bringing together macromolecules into a phase-separated condensate.

    summary: MEG-3 localizes to the cytoplasm, specifically in association with P
      granules. This annotation is correct but very general; the more specific P granule
      localization is also annotated.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a correct but general localization annotation. MEG-3 is cytoplasmic
      and specifically associates with P granules. The study used GFP-tagged MEG-3
      to show cytoplasmic localization. While the P granule annotation is more informative,
      this broader cytoplasm annotation is not incorrect and captures the general
      cellular compartment.

    reason: The Tsuboi et al. 2002 study was a methodological paper describing a novel
      screening approach, using GEX-3 as a model case to identify interacting molecules.
      While MEG-3/GEI-12 was identified as an interactor, the biological significance
      of this interaction is not established. The relevance to MEG-3's core P granule
      function is unclear. This appears to be a non-specific or weak interaction that
      may not reflect in vivo function.

  review:
    summary: This is a very broad biological process annotation. While MEG-3 mutants
      do show embryonic phenotypes (reduced fertility, P granule defects), this term
      is too general to be informative about MEG-3's specific function in P granule
      assembly.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The embryo development annotation is not incorrect but is too broad. MEG-3's
      primary function is in P granule assembly and germ plasm organization, which
      are specific aspects of early embryo development. The fertility defects in meg-3
      meg-4 double mutants (~70% fertility) demonstrate a role in embryonic development,
      but this annotation does not capture the specific molecular and cellular function.
      More specific terms like P granule assembly (GO:1903863) are already annotated.

  review:
    summary: MEG-3 is the primary scaffold protein for P granule assembly through
      liquid-liquid phase separation. It binds and brings together RNA and other P
      granule proteins (PGL-1, PGL-3) to organize the molecular condensate.
    action: NEW
    reason: MEG-3 is an excellent example of a molecular condensate scaffold. The
      term definition "Binding and bringing together two or more macromolecules in
      contact, permitting those molecules to organize as a molecular condensate" precisely
      describes MEG-3's function. The Wang et al. 2014 study shows MEG-3 localizes
      to a dynamic domain surrounding P granules and regulates their assembly through
      phosphorylation-dependent phase transitions.

  review:
    summary: MEG-3 is a component of the germ plasm. P granules are germ plasm components,
      and MEG-3 localizes to and drives the assembly of P granules, which are the
      defining structures of C. elegans germ plasm.
    action: NEW
    reason: The Wang et al. 2014 study explicitly states that the MEG proteins are
      germ plasm components. Germ plasm (GO:0060293) is defined as differentiated
      cytoplasm associated with a pole of an oocyte, egg or early embryo that will
      be inherited by the cells that will give rise to the germ line. MEG-3's localization
      to P granules, which are the cytoplasmic manifestation of germ plasm in C. elegans,
      supports this annotation.

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the precise mechanism by which MEG-3 IDR drives phase separation
    - does it involve specific amino acid motifs or is it a more general property
    of the disordered region?
- question: How does MEG-3 coordinate with MEG-4 in P granule assembly, and why are
    single mutants fertile while double mutants show significant fertility defects?
- question: What RNAs does MEG-3 bind, and does it show specificity for maternal germline
    mRNAs?
suggested_experiments:
- description: CLIP-seq or eCLIP to identify MEG-3 RNA targets. This would reveal
    which RNAs MEG-3 binds and whether it shows specificity for germline-enriched
    transcripts.
  hypothesis: MEG-3 preferentially binds maternal germline mRNAs to recruit them to
    P granules
- description: Structure-function analysis of MEG-3 IDR using systematic deletions.
    This would identify minimal sequences required for phase separation and P granule
    assembly.
  hypothesis: Specific sequence motifs within the IDR are required for phase separation
- description: Phospho-proteomic analysis of MEG-3 under different developmental conditions.
    This would map the phosphorylation sites regulated by MBK-2 and PP2A and correlate
    with granule dynamics.
  hypothesis: Specific phosphorylation sites control the sol-gel transition of MEG-3
