description: JMJD-3.1 is a JmjC domain-containing lysine-specific demethylase belonging
  to the UTX/KDM6 family that specifically demethylates H3K27me2/me3, marks associated
  with transcriptional repression. The enzyme requires Fe(II) as a cofactor for its
  dioxygenase activity. JMJD-3.1 functions in the nucleus where it removes repressive
  H3K27 methylation marks at specific loci to enable gene activation. Unlike the related
  UTX-1 which is the dominant global H3K27 demethylase during development, JMJD-3.1
  acts more locus-specifically and contributes primarily to stress response pathways
  including the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and heat shock response.
  It is required for the robust transdifferentiation of the Y rectal epithelial cell
  into the PDA motor neuron during larval development. Overexpression of jmjd-3.1
  extends lifespan in a manner dependent on UPRmt components (ATFS-1, UBL-5, CLPP-1).

  review:
    summary: JMJD-3.1 regulates gene expression by removing repressive H3K27me2/me3
      marks, thereby enabling transcriptional activation. This is well-supported by
      studies showing jmjd-3.1 is required for stress-induced gene expression programs
      (UPRmt, HSR) and for gene activation during transdifferentiation (PMID:25124442,
      PMID:27133168).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation accurately captures that jmjd-3.1 regulates gene expression.
      As an H3K27 demethylase, its core function is to remove repressive chromatin
      marks and enable transcriptional activation of specific gene sets. This is a
      parent term to more specific processes and is appropriate for the phylogenetic
      inference.

  review:
    summary: JMJD-3.1 is a member of the UTX/KDM6 family and contains the conserved
      JmjC catalytic domain. Experimental evidence from PMID:17713478 and PMID:25124442
      demonstrates H3K27me2/me3 demethylase activity. Mutations in catalytic residues
      abolish function in transdifferentiation assays (PMID:25124442).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the core molecular function of jmjd-3.1. The IBA annotation is
      consistent with direct experimental evidence from IDA annotations and the known
      domain architecture (JmjC domain with conserved Fe-binding residues). This represents
      the primary enzymatic activity of the protein.

  review:
    summary: The IBA annotation infers MLL3/4 complex membership based on orthology
      to mammalian JMJD3/KDM6B. However, in C. elegans, UTX-1 (not jmjd-3.1) has been
      shown to associate with SET-16/MLL-like complexes. The literature explicitly
      notes that jmjd-3.1 partners are not well established and it may act more locus-specifically
      rather than as part of large chromatin assemblies.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: While mammalian JMJD3/KDM6B is associated with MLL3/4 complexes, direct
      evidence for C. elegans jmjd-3.1 membership in an equivalent complex is lacking.
      The literature (Vandamme et al. 2012) specifically found UTX-1 in complex with
      SET-16 but did not identify jmjd-3.1 complex partners. The phylogenetic inference
      may not hold in this case given the functional divergence between UTX-1 and
      JMJD-3 paralogs in C. elegans. More biochemical evidence is needed to confirm
      or refute this annotation.

  review:
    summary: This annotation suggests jmjd-3.1 has sequence-specific DNA binding activity
      at Pol II regulatory regions. However, jmjd-3.1 is recruited to chromatin through
      protein-protein interactions (e.g., with transcription factors like UNC-3) rather
      than through intrinsic sequence-specific DNA binding. The protein lacks recognizable
      DNA-binding domains.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: JMJD-3.1 does not contain canonical sequence-specific DNA-binding domains.
      While it functions at regulatory regions to demethylate H3K27, it is recruited
      through interactions with transcription factors (e.g., UNC-3 as shown in PMID:25124442)
      rather than through direct sequence-specific DNA recognition. The chromatin

    summary: JMJD-3.1 functions at chromatin where it demethylates H3K27. The protein

      chromatin binding activity is consistent with its role as a histone demethylase.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: As a histone demethylase that acts on chromatin-bound histones, jmjd-3.1
      must bind to chromatin to carry out its function. The annotation is appropriate

      remodeling.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Chromatin remodeling in GO specifically refers to ATP-dependent nucleosome
      repositioning or eviction. JMJD-3.1 is not an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler
      but rather a covalent histone modifier. The more appropriate term is 'histone

    summary: JMJD-3.1 binds Fe(II) as a required cofactor for its dioxygenase activity.
      The JmjC domain contains conserved histidine and glutamate residues (H811, E813,
      H891) that coordinate Fe(II). Additionally, the C-terminal region contains a
      zinc-binding site (C998, C1001, C1025, C1028).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Metal ion binding is essential for jmjd-3.1 function. UniProt annotation
      confirms Fe(II) as cofactor and zinc binding at the C-terminus. While a more
      specific term like 'iron ion binding' could be used, this general annotation
      is appropriate for an IEA.

    demethylates H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 marks. This is supported by conserved JmjC
    domain with Fe(II)-binding catalytic residues and orthology to characterized mammalian
    JMJD3/KDM6B. Unlike UTX-1, jmjd-3.1 acts more at specific loci rather than globally.

- description: JMJD-3.1 is a key regulator of the mitochondrial UPR. Gain of function
    is sufficient to extend lifespan in a UPRmt-dependent manner. The lifespan-extending
    effects of jmjd-3.1 depend on UPRmt components ATFS-1, UBL-5, and CLPP-1.

suggested_questions:
- question: Does jmjd-3.1 function as part of a larger chromatin-modifying complex
    in C. elegans, similar to mammalian JMJD3 in MLL3/4 complexes? While UTX-1 associates
    with SET-16/MLL-like complexes, jmjd-3.1 protein partners remain poorly defined.
    Understanding whether it acts alone or in a complex would clarify its recruitment
    mechanism.
- question: What is the genomic targeting mechanism for jmjd-3.1 at stress-responsive
    loci? JMJD-3.1 appears to act at specific loci rather than globally. The interaction
    with UNC-3 provides one example, but genome-wide ChIP studies would reveal the
    full scope of its targets.
- question: How do the three JMJD3 paralogs (jmjd-3.1, jmjd-3.2, jmjd-3.3) partition
    their functions? Triple deletion shows no additional phenotypes beyond jmjd-3.1
    single mutants, suggesting potential redundancy, but individual paralogs may have
    distinct stress-specific or tissue-specific roles.
