## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8IG69
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homolog 2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:26876169};
- **Gene Information:** Name=cebp-2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:C48E7.11}; ORFNames=C48E7.11 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:C48E7.11};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the bZIP family. C/EBP subfamily. .
- **Key Domains:** bZIP. (IPR004827); bZIP_sf. (IPR046347); C/EBP. (IPR031106); bZIP_2 (PF07716)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "cebp-2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'cebp-2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **cebp-2** (gene ID: cebp-2, UniProt: Q8IG69) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Comprehensive research report
1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein identity and domain architecture: cebp-2 encodes a C/EBP-family basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor in C. elegans (WormBase locus C48E7.11; UniProt Q8IG69). CEBP-2 shows sequence homology to mammalian C/EBPγ, carries a bZIP DNA-binding/dimerization domain, and is therefore inferred to function as a nuclear transcription factor. Identity validation and family/domain assignment come from sequence analysis and high-throughput interaction data identifying CEBP-2 as a strong partner of ZIP-2. URL (UniProt): https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8IG69. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94, dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 94-99)
- Functional paradigm—surveillance immunity: C. elegans detects pathogen-elicited disruptions to host physiology—particularly translational inhibition and mitochondrial distress—triggering transcriptional responses via bZIP factors, including CEBP-2. Surveillance immunity complements pattern recognition and is a central theme for intestinal defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pukkila-Worley 2016 review: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005795 (Sept 2016). (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 57-59)
- Core partners and modules: CEBP-2 forms functional complexes with ZIP-2 and ZIP-11 to drive immune gene expression in the intestine. These modules can operate in parallel to, or in part independent of, PMK-1/p38 MAPK signaling. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 94-99, zheng2021thebziptranscription pages 8-9)

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Proteasome surveillance links to tissue-specific immune programs (2023 preprint; 2024 peer-reviewed): Work from Grover et al. shows that perturbing SKN-1A/NRF1-mediated proteasome surveillance triggers tissue-specific immune programs (ORR/IPR). In this framework, bZIP factors, including CEBP-2, are referenced as regulators of surveillance-activated immune genes, integrating proteostasis with innate immunity. Peer-reviewed article: PLoS Biology (Mar 2024), https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002543; preprint (Aug 2023), https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.22.554255. These studies reinforce the role of bZIP TFs such as CEBP-2 within broader surveillance networks beyond classic PMK-1 pathways. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94)
- Continued delineation of ZIP-11–CEBP-2 independent arm (2021 foundation for ongoing work): Zheng et al. demonstrated that ZIP-11 interacts with CEBP-2 to mediate transcriptional responses to P. aeruginosa independently of PMK-1/p38, a theme increasingly recognized as part of parallel/independent arms of immunity that may be engaged by distinct physiological insults. Frontiers in Immunology (Nov 2021), https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.744454. (zheng2021thebziptranscription pages 8-9)
- Translational inhibition to bZIP activation (foundational 2020–2022, extended by recent surveillance studies): P. aeruginosa can directly damage ribosomes (H69 rRNA cleavage), antagonized by host defenses including zip-2, coupling translational inhibition to the ZIP-2/CEBP-2 program; these data contextualize why cebp-2-partnered bZIP responses are rapidly induced by infection. PLoS Biology (Dec 2020), https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000969. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Reporter-based immune readouts: irg-1p::GFP is widely used to monitor activation of the ZIP-2/CEBP-2 axis during infection. Loss of cebp-2 diminishes reporter induction, enabling functional assays of immune surveillance in vivo. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 94-99)
- Genetic interaction and epistasis mapping: Combining cebp-2 perturbations with zip-2/zip-11 and pmk-1 manipulations helps assignment of pathway branches (PMK-1-dependent versus independent) and dissection of transcriptional specificity in intestinal immunity. (zheng2021thebziptranscription pages 8-9, dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 94-99)
- Surveillance networks as targets: The proteasome–immune axis and mitochondrial surveillance/ESRE provide practical entry points to modulate defense states, with CEBP-2 among the bZIPs implicated in integrating these cues. These insights are used to design tissue-specific immune activation paradigms. (tjahjono2017aconservedmitochondrial pages 8-11, dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Surveillance immunity as a unifying framework: The Pukkila-Worley review highlights surveillance of host physiology as an organizing principle for C. elegans immunity, with ZIP-2 and CEBP-2 forming a conserved module responding to translational stress. PLoS Pathogens (Sep 2016), https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005795. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 57-59)
- ESRE/mitochondrial surveillance: Studies by Tjahjono and Kirienko established the ESRE network as activated by mitochondrial damage, with contributions from bZIP factors including CEBP-2 and overlap with ZIP-2 activity, indicating crosstalk between metabolic state and immune transcription. PLoS Genetics (Jun 2017), https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006876. (tjahjono2017aconservedmitochondrial pages 8-11)
- ZIP-11–CEBP-2 independent branch: Zheng et al. provide mechanistic genetic evidence that the ZIP-11–CEBP-2 arm can drive immune responses in a manner independent of PMK-1/p38, complementing the canonical MAPK module. Frontiers in Immunology (Nov 2021), https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.744454. (zheng2021thebziptranscription pages 8-9)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Loss-of-function phenotypes: cebp-2 RNAi and the cebp-2(tm5421) deletion (lacking bZIP domain) result in marked reduction of infection-induced irg-1p::GFP and decreased irg-1/irg-2 mRNA induction; cebp-2 knockdown also reduces survival in P. aeruginosa killing assays. These phenotypes strongly support a role for CEBP-2 in activating protective intestinal transcriptional programs. (Dunbar 2013; methods include RNAi, qRT-PCR, reporter imaging, killing assays). (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 94-99)
- Dimerization and target specificity: High-throughput in vitro interaction screens (pre-2013) indicated CEBP-2 is a strong ZIP-2 interactor; subsequent functional analyses show CEBP-2–ZIP-2 and CEBP-2–ZIP-11 complexes regulate infection-response genes including irg-1 and irg-2, and additional targets such as F11D11.3 and oac-32. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94, malinow2022novelsignalingmechanismsa pages 27-32, malinow2022novelsignalingmechanismsb pages 27-32)
- Translational inhibition triggers: P. aeruginosa induces ribosome H69 cleavage, driving zip-2 pathway activation and immune gene induction in the intestine, providing a mechanistic link between bacterial virulence strategies and host bZIP responses. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94)
- Mitochondrial surveillance/ESRE: ESRE activation by mitochondrial damage is partially dependent on bZIPs (including CEBP-2), reinforcing a conserved mitochondrial surveillance role in immunity. (tjahjono2017aconservedmitochondrial pages 8-11)
- 2023–2024 surveillance integration: Perturbing proteasome surveillance programs (SKN-1A/NRF1 axis) engages tissue-specific immune responses with genes controlled by ZIP-2/CEBP-2-listed bZIP TFs, underscoring surveillance crosstalk and providing contemporary context for CEBP-2 function. PLoS Biology (Mar 2024), https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002543. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94)

Functional annotation of cebp-2
- Primary molecular function: bZIP DNA-binding transcription factor of the C/EBP family. Inferred nuclear localization based on bZIP domain and transcriptional activity; direct nuclear localization data for CEBP-2 are less frequently reported than for partners like ZIP-2/ZIP-1 but are strongly implied by function. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 94-99)
- Interaction partners and complexes: Heterodimerizes functionally with ZIP-2 to activate surveillance-immune targets; also interacts with ZIP-11 to regulate immune transcription independently of PMK-1/p38. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 94-99, zheng2021thebziptranscription pages 8-9, malinow2022novelsignalingmechanismsa pages 27-32)
- Target genes and transcriptional programs: Promotes induction of infection response genes including irg-1 and irg-2, with additional reported targets such as F11D11.3 and oac-32; these responses reduce intestinal bacterial burden. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 94-99, malinow2022novelsignalingmechanismsa pages 27-32)
- Pathways and context: Central to surveillance immunity triggered by translational inhibition (e.g., P. aeruginosa toxins or ribosome damage) and participates in mitochondrial surveillance/ESRE responses to mitochondrial stress; operates in pathways that are partially independent of PMK-1/p38. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 90-94, tjahjono2017aconservedmitochondrial pages 8-11, zheng2021thebziptranscription pages 8-9)
- Tissue and subcellular site of action: Acts in the intestine to promote resistance to P. aeruginosa; as a bZIP TF, activity is expected in intestinal nuclei during activation. (zheng2021thebziptranscription pages 8-9, dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 94-99)
- Phenotypes upon perturbation: cebp-2 loss blunts induction of immune reporters/targets (e.g., irg-1/irg-2) and increases susceptibility to P. aeruginosa killing. Neuronal overexpression of CEBP-2 (or related C/EBP pathway activity) can shorten lifespan via enhanced neural excitation, highlighting potential tissue-specific consequences beyond gut immunity. Science Advances (Apr 2022), https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abj8658. (dunbar2013analyzingtherole pages 94-99, zheng2021thebziptranscription pages 8-9)

Quality and caveats
- Much of the cebp-2 mechanistic work is anchored in 2013–2022 primary studies; 2023–2024 research integrates cebp-2 among broader surveillance programs (proteasome/ORR–IPR), but direct cebp-2-specific new mechanistic findings in those years are limited in the retrieved corpus. Where localization of CEBP-2 is inferred from domain/function rather than directly imaged, this is stated as inference.

Conclusion
CEBP-2 (Q8IG69) is a C/EBP-family bZIP transcription factor that executes a central role in C. elegans surveillance immunity. It functions primarily in the intestine as part of ZIP-2– and ZIP-11–containing complexes to drive transcription of infection-response genes (e.g., irg-1/irg-2) upon pathogen-induced translational inhibition and during mitochondrial surveillance/ESRE activation. These modules can act in parallel to, and in part independently of, PMK-1/p38 MAPK signaling. Loss of cebp-2 compromises induction of immune effectors and host survival in P. aeruginosa infection models. Recent work (2023–2024) places cebp-2-associated bZIP activity within broader proteasome and tissue-specific immune surveillance networks, integrating proteostasis and mitochondrial stress cues with innate immunity.
