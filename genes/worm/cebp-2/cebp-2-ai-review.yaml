description: CEBP-2 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian 
  CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein gamma (C/EBPgamma). It is a bZIP family 
  transcription factor that functions as a key player in surveillance immunity, 
  acting together with ZIP-2 in the protective response to translational block 
  by P. aeruginosa Exotoxin A and perturbations of other core cellular 
  processes. CEBP-2 also interacts with ZIP-11 to mediate innate immune 
  responses independently of the PMK-1/p38 MAPK pathway. Beyond immunity, CEBP-2
  regulates expression of genes involved in fat metabolism, controlling fatty 
  acid mitochondrial beta-oxidation and desaturation. The protein is expressed 
  broadly in somatic tissues including the intestine and localizes to the 
  nucleus.

    review:
      summary: CEBP-2 is a bZIP transcription factor that contains a basic 
        DNA-binding region and leucine-zipper domain. The IBA annotation is 
        based on phylogenetic inference from C/EBP family members that are 
        established sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. The UniProt entry 
        confirms the bZIP domain (residues 17-80) with a basic motif (residues 
        23-48) and leucine-zipper (residues 52-73).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation is well-supported by domain architecture. CEBP-2 
        has a canonical bZIP domain with basic region for DNA binding. The C/EBP
        family is well characterized for sequence-specific DNA binding to 
        CCAAT/enhancer elements. IBA annotations from PANTHER phylogenetic 
        analysis are reliable for core transcription factor functions conserved 
        across the family.

    description: CEBP-2 is a bZIP transcription factor that binds to 
      CCAAT/enhancer elements in target gene promoters and regulates their 
      transcription. It contains a canonical bZIP domain (residues 17-80) with 
      basic motif for DNA binding and leucine-zipper for dimerization. It 
      regulates transcription of target genes including irg-1, ech-1.1, and 
      fat-5.

      its leucine-zipper domain. The interaction with ZIP-2 and ZIP-11 is 
      functionally important for surveillance immunity against P. aeruginosa.

suggested_questions:
  - question: Does CEBP-2 directly bind to ESRE (Ethanol and Stress Response 
      Element) motifs, or does it regulate ESRE network genes through a 
      different mechanism?
  - question: What is the relationship between CEBP-2's role in lipid metabolism
      and its immune function? Are these independent functions or interconnected
      through metabolic reprogramming during infection?
suggested_experiments:
  - description: ChIP-seq to identify direct CEBP-2 binding sites genome-wide 
      and determine whether it binds CCAAT/enhancer elements and/or ESRE motifs.
  - description: Epistasis analysis between cebp-2, zip-2, zip-11, and other 
      bZIP factors during different types of stress (pathogen, mitochondrial, 
      translational) to map the regulatory hierarchy.
