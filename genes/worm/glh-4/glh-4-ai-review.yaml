description: GLH-4 (Germline Helicase 4) is a Vasa/DDX4-class ATP-dependent DEAD-box
  RNA helicase that localizes to perinuclear P granules in the C. elegans germline.
  It functions redundantly with GLH-1 to organize P granule architecture and maintain
  piRNA pathway fidelity. GLH-4 contains a conserved DEAD-box helicase domain, five
  CCHC-type zinc fingers, and N-terminal glycine-rich FG/FGG repeats that promote
  perinuclear localization by interacting with nuclear pore-like FG hydrogels. The
  protein acts as a scaffold that recruits Argonaute proteins (PRG-1, WAGO-4) and
  coordinates 22G-RNA amplification at piRNA targets. While single glh-4 mutants show
  minimal phenotypes, glh-1;glh-4 double mutants exhibit severe germline defects including
  sterility, under-proliferated germlines lacking oocytes, and dispersed P granule
  components, demonstrating the critical redundant role of these helicases in germline
  development and fertility.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from PANTHER. While GLH-4
      belongs to the DEAD-box helicase family (DDX4/VASA subfamily), there is no direct
      evidence that GLH-4 participates in SSU-rRNA maturation. The primary literature
      consistently describes GLH-4's role in P granule organization and piRNA pathway
      function rather than ribosome biogenesis (PMID:10851135, Chen et al. 2022).
      This may be an over-extension from more distant DEAD-box helicase family members.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: GLH-4 is a germline-specific P granule component with established functions
      in germline development and piRNA pathway fidelity. There is no literature evidence
      supporting a role in SSU-rRNA maturation. The IBA inference likely derives from
      distant DEAD-box helicase family members with different cellular functions.

suggested_questions:
- question: Does GLH-4 have direct RNA helicase activity in vitro, and what are its
    substrate preferences? While GLH-4 is classified as an RNA helicase based on domain
    architecture and family membership, direct biochemical demonstration of its helicase
    activity has not been reported.
- question: What is the specific division of labor between GLH-1 and GLH-4 in P granule
    function? While these proteins function redundantly, subtle differences in their
    expression patterns, protein interactions, or substrate preferences may exist.
- question: How does GLH-4 contribute to piRNA target discrimination and self/non-self
    recognition? Chen et al. 2022 showed GLH-1/GLH-4 are required for piRNA pathway
    fidelity, but the molecular mechanism is not fully understood.
suggested_experiments:
- description: In vitro RNA helicase assay with purified GLH-4 protein. Direct biochemical
    demonstration of RNA helicase activity would confirm the ISS/IEA annotations and
    characterize substrate specificity. GLH-4 should show ATP-dependent RNA unwinding
    activity typical of DEAD-box helicases.
- description: IP-MS of GLH-4 protein complexes in wild-type and ATPase-mutant backgrounds.
    Similar experiments on GLH-1 identified Argonaute and P granule scaffold interactions.
    GLH-4-specific interactors could reveal unique functions and should include PRG-1,
    WAGO proteins, and DEPS-1.
- description: smFISH analysis of piRNA target mRNA localization in glh-4 single mutants.
    Most studies use double mutants. Single mutant analysis could reveal GLH-4-specific
    contributions to mRNA surveillance that are masked by GLH-1 redundancy.
