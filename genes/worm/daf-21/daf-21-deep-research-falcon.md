## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q18688
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Heat shock protein 90; AltName: Full=Abnormal dauer formation protein 21;
- **Gene Information:** Name=hsp-90 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:CAA99793.1}; Synonyms=daf-21 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:CAA99793.1}; ORFNames=C47E8.5;
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the heat shock protein 90 family. .
- **Key Domains:** HATPase_C_sf. (IPR036890); HSP90_C. (IPR037196); Hsp90_fam. (IPR001404); Hsp90_N. (IPR020575); Ribosomal_Su5_D2-typ_SF. (IPR020568)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "hsp-90" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'hsp-90' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **hsp-90** (gene ID: daf-21, UniProt: Q18688) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: The target is Caenorhabditis elegans hsp-90 (synonym daf-21; ORF C47E8.5), encoding the single cytosolic Hsp90 isoform. Literature explicitly states C. elegans has one cytosolic HSP-90/DAF-21 and aligns with canonical Hsp90 domains and ATPase cycle, matching UniProt Q18688 (Hsp90_N, middle domain with catalytic glutamate, charged linker, C-terminal dimerization with MEEVD) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesofa pages 1-3, gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 14-14).

Comprehensive research report on C. elegans hsp-90/daf-21 (UniProt Q18688)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and family: DAF-21/HSP-90 is the sole cytosolic Hsp90 in C. elegans, a highly conserved ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that assists folding/activation of many signaling clients (kinases, transcription factors, steroid receptors) (Biomolecules review, Jan 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13020251) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesofa pages 1-3, oostenhawle2023organismalrolesof pages 5-7).
- ATPase cycle and conformational switching: HSP-90 operates as a dimer; ATP binding drives N-terminal dimerization and a closed conformation stabilized by p23/Sba1, hydrolysis promotes client release and reopening; cycle kinetics are tuned by cochaperones such as Aha1 (accelerates ATPase) and Cdc37 (kinase loading) (reviewed 2023; structural/mechanistic citations within the C. elegans studies) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesofa pages 1-3, gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 14-14).
- C. elegans biochemical properties: DAF-21 exhibits chaperone activity suppressing thermal aggregation of client reporters (citrate synthase) in vitro; YFP tagging reduces ATP hydrolysis but ATPase is stimulated by C. elegans Aha1 (CeAha1). Analytical ultracentrifugation shows DAF-21 at ~5.9 S, with cofactor-induced complex shifts, consistent with nucleotide- and partner-dependent conformational states (PLoS ONE, Sep 2011, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025485) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Organismal proteostasis signaling and longevity: In metazoans including C. elegans, HSP-90 regulates inter-tissue proteostasis programs. Overexpression or depletion can trigger transcellular chaperone signaling (TCS) between gut, neurons, and muscle via PQM-1 and tissue-specific secreted mediators; mild pharmacologic HSP90 inhibition (e.g., tanespimycin/monorden) can extend lifespan via HSF-1, whereas strong depletion causes developmental defects (Biomolecules review, Jan 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13020251) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesof pages 5-7).
- Transcriptomic arrest state mapping after hsp-90 RNAi: Genome-wide coexpression clique analysis (Scientific Reports, Jun 2021, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91690-6) showed that hsp-90/daf-21 RNAi arrests development near the L4 stage with characteristic induction of heat-shock response and alterations in innate immune and DAF-16 target gene cliques; L4 correspondence was supported by correlation coefficients R² ≈ 0.40–0.59 across datasets (schmauder2021hsp90andunc45 pages 1-2, schmauder2021hsp90andunc45 pages 9-10).
- Neuron/cilia-specific client control (new): A 2025 G3 study reported an hsp-90/daf-21 missense allele (S564F) that causes misaccumulation of endogenous GFP::DLK-1 and up-regulates CEBP-1 specifically in ciliated sensory neurons, linking HSP-90 to cilia/intraflagellar transport-regulated DLK-1 signaling (Advance Access Jan 24, 2025, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkaf004) (sun2025multipleregulatorsconstrain pages 1-2, sun2025multipleregulatorsconstrain pages 8-12).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Genetic perturbations: Tissue-specific RNAi and hypomorphic alleles are used to resolve daf-21 roles by stage and tissue, revealing spatiotemporal requirements in development, fertility, and longevity, including neuron-specific contributions to dauer induction (Scientific Reports, Aug 2018, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-30592-6) (somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 8-10).
- Pharmacology: Classical HSP90 inhibitors (e.g., geldanamycin, radicicol; also tanespimycin/monorden) are used in worms to modulate HSP90, with dose-dependent organismal effects on lifespan and stress responses (Biomolecules review, 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13020251) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesof pages 5-7).
- Biophysical interaction assays in vivo: YFP-DAF-21 localization and mobility, and interaction with muscle co-chaperone UNC-45, have been leveraged to map muscle assembly roles; fluorescence/AUC approaches quantify binding to TPR co-chaperones (UNC-45N, PPH-5, STI-1) (PLoS ONE, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025485) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Review perspective: HSP-90 integrates intracellular proteostasis with organismal stress signaling, impacting development, immunity, neuronal function, behavior, aging, and evolution; C. elegans provides a single cytosolic HSP-90/DAF-21 enabling clear genetic dissection (Biomolecules, 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13020251) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesofa pages 1-3, oostenhawle2023organismalrolesof pages 5-7).
- Systems-level transcriptomics: Coexpression clique analysis offers a rigorous map of hsp-90 RNAi developmental arrest and ties HSP-90 depletion to DAF-16-regulated deviations from normal developmental programs (Scientific Reports, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91690-6) (schmauder2021hsp90andunc45 pages 9-10, schmauder2021hsp90andunc45 pages 19-20).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Biophysical/enzymatic: DAF-21 suppresses citrate synthase aggregation at 0.1 mM (partial) and 0.5 mM (full) in vitro; sedimentation ~5.9 S for DAF-21, shifting to ~6.7 S with UNC-45N, and YFP-DAF-21 ~7.3 S shifting to ~6.0 S upon intramolecular fragment addition; ATPase stimulation by CeAha1 is demonstrable (PLoS ONE, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025485) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).
- Developmental mapping: hsp-90 RNAi-arrested state correlates best with L4 (R² ≈ 0.4046, 0.5913, 0.5915 across datasets); clique-level enrichments cover cuticle/collagen, dauer metabolism, and reproductive phenotypes (Scientific Reports, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91690-6) (schmauder2021hsp90andunc45 pages 9-10, schmauder2021hsp90andunc45 pages 14-15).
- Longevity modulation: daf-21 knockdown shortens wild-type and daf-2 mutant lifespan and selectively impairs DAF-16A-driven longevity programs, while leaving DAF-16D/F largely unaffected; DAF-21 promotes DAF-16A nuclear translocation and target gene induction under IIS reduction and heat shock (Scientific Reports, Aug 2018, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-30592-6) (somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 1-2, somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 8-10).

Functional annotation
- Molecular function and domains: DAF-21 is an ATP-dependent chaperone with canonical Hsp90 N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain, middle domain harboring catalytic Glu and client-contact surfaces, flexible charged linker, and C-terminal dimerization domain with MEEVD motif for TPR cochaperone binding. Its ATPase cycle undergoes nucleotide-dependent N-terminal dimerization and p23-stabilized closure, with cochaperones Aha1 (activates ATP hydrolysis) and Cdc37 (stabilizes kinase clients) modulating kinetics and client flow (Biomolecules 2023; PLoS ONE 2011) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesofa pages 1-3, gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 14-14, gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).
- Principal co-chaperones in C. elegans: Interactions have been observed with TPR co-chaperones UNC-45 (muscle myosin assembly), PPH-5, and STI-1/HOP via fluorescence-detection AUC; Aha1 stimulates DAF-21 ATPase; p23 stabilizes the closed ATP-bound state; Cdc37 (p50) mediates kinase client loading; PPIase FKB-6 stabilizes kinase–Hsp90 complexes in metazoa with worm-relevant implications (PLoS ONE 2011; review/thesis synthesis of C. elegans system) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13, schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 139-141, gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 14-14).
- Known clients/pathways in C. elegans:
  • DAF-16/FOXO pathway: DAF-21 promotes DAF-16A activation and nuclear translocation under reduced IIS and heat shock, enabling DAF-16A-specific transcription and lifespan extension; effects on DAF-16D/F are minimal (Scientific Reports 2018, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-30592-6) (somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 1-2, somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 8-10).
  • Muscle myosin assembly: DAF-21 cooperates with UNC-45; its depletion causes MYO-3 aggregation and motility defects, evidencing client roles in sarcomere proteostasis (PLoS ONE 2011, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025485) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).
  • DLK-1–CEBP-1 signaling in ciliated neurons: hsp-90(S564F) increases DLK-1 abundance at cilia and elevates CEBP-1, revealing a neuron/cilia-specific client relationship (G3 2025, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkaf004) (sun2025multipleregulatorsconstrain pages 1-2, sun2025multipleregulatorsconstrain pages 8-12).
  • Dauer formation and chemosensation: daf-21 influences dauer entry and chemosensory pathways linked to DAF-11 guanylyl cyclase and TGF-β/DAF-7 signaling network components, situating HSP-90 in developmental and sensory signaling (Biomolecules 2023) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesofa pages 10-11).
  • Potential steroid receptor axis: p23–Hsp90 complex impacts longevity in a temperature-dependent manner; DAF-12 has been noted as an Hsp90/p23-related client in nematodes, suggesting roles in nuclear receptor maturation (Biomolecules 2023) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesof pages 5-7).

Subcellular localization
- Muscle: YFP-DAF-21 localizes to I-band and M-line in live muscle but is transient and not stably attached to myofilaments, consistent with a diffusible chaperone role in sarcomere maintenance; UNC-45 shows broader and more stable myofilament association (PLoS ONE, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025485) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).
- Neurons/cilia: The hsp-90(S564F) allele shows a cilia-enriched effect on DLK-1 accumulation, indicating cilia-compartment regulation; HSP-90 is broadly expressed but can have compartment-specific impacts (G3, 2025, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkaf004) (sun2025multipleregulatorsconstrain pages 8-12).

Phenotypes of loss-of-function, RNAi, hypomorphs, and chemical inhibition
- Strong reduction (RNAi/hypomorph): Developmental arrest near L4 stage, reduced motility, heat-shock/innate immune transcriptome activation, and reproductive defects including impaired oocyte development; essential for vulva/gonad development and oocyte meiotic transitions (Scientific Reports 2021, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91690-6; Biomolecules 2023) (schmauder2021hsp90andunc45 pages 1-2, schmauder2021hsp90andunc45 pages 11-12, oostenhawle2023organismalrolesofa pages 10-11).
- Muscle-specific outcomes: MYO-3 aggregation, induction of muscle stress responses, and motility defects upon DAF-21 depletion or ATPase-compromised alleles (PLoS ONE, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025485) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).
- Longevity modulation: daf-21 knockdown shortens lifespan and suppresses DAF-16A-dependent longevity; neuronal daf-21 silencing contributes to dauer induction under specific contexts (Scientific Reports, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-30592-6) (somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 8-10).
- Pharmacologic modulation: Mild HSP90 inhibition extends lifespan via HSF-1; conversely, severe inhibition is detrimental to development and viability (Biomolecules, 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13020251) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesof pages 5-7).

Pathways and mechanistic context
- Insulin/IGF-1–DAF-2/DAF-16 axis: DAF-21 regulates DAF-16A activation and nuclear translocation downstream of insulin receptor signaling and heat shock, integrating proteostasis with stress and metabolic control of longevity (Scientific Reports 2018, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-30592-6) (somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 1-2, somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 8-10).
- TGF-β/DAF-7 and chemosensory networks: HSP-90 intersects with dauer and sensory signaling networks (e.g., DAF-11), consistent with broad client coverage of signaling components (Biomolecules, 2023) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesofa pages 10-11).
- Muscle proteostasis pathway: DAF-21 cooperates with UNC-45 and other TPR co-chaperones to maintain sarcomere integrity, aligning with localization and aggregation phenotypes (PLoS ONE, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025485) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).
- Neuronal/ciliary stress signaling: New evidence ties HSP-90 to DLK-1–CEBP-1 regulation in ciliated sensory neurons, integrating Hsp90 with axon/dendrite compartmental quality control and intraflagellar transport (G3, 2025, https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkaf004) (sun2025multipleregulatorsconstrain pages 1-2, sun2025multipleregulatorsconstrain pages 8-12).

Limitations and open questions
- Quantitative lifespan effects of graded daf-21 perturbations can vary by timing and tissue; many numerical values are context-dependent and not uniformly reported across studies. Client catalogs in C. elegans remain incomplete; recent work nominates neuron/cilia clients (DLK-1) and muscle clients (myosins), with broader signaling targets inferred from conserved Hsp90 biology (somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 1-2, oostenhawle2023organismalrolesof pages 5-7, sun2025multipleregulatorsconstrain pages 1-2).
