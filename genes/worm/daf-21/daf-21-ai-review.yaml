description: DAF-21 is the sole HSP90 ortholog in C. elegans, functioning as an 
  essential ATP-dependent molecular chaperone critical for protein folding, 
  signal transduction, and stress response. The protein is required for multiple
  developmental processes including dauer formation (hence the "daf" 
  nomenclature), chemosensory behaviors, oocyte maturation, and muscle 
  maintenance. DAF-21 stabilizes client proteins including guanylyl cyclase 
  DAF-11 in chemosensory neurons, WEE-1.3 kinase during oocyte development, and 
  myosin in muscle cells. The chaperone functions in complexes with 
  co-chaperones including UNC-45, STI-1, CDC-37, and AHA-1, and activates 
  protein phosphatase 5 (PPH-5). DAF-21 also participates in transcellular 
  chaperone signaling, where tissue-specific HSP-90 expression can 
  non-cell-autonomously induce chaperone expression in distal tissues to 
  maintain organismal proteostasis.

    review:
      summary: DAF-21/HSP90 is a well-established molecular chaperone that 
        promotes protein folding. This core function is supported by multiple 
        lines of evidence including the role in myosin folding in muscle cells 
        (PMID:21980476) and stabilization of client proteins such as DAF-11 
        guanylyl cyclase (PMID:10790386).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Protein folding is the central molecular function of HSP90 
        proteins. The phylogenetic inference from IBA is fully consistent with 
        experimental evidence showing DAF-21 participates in folding of myosin 
        and other client proteins.

suggested_questions:
  - question: What are the key client proteins for DAF-21 in dauer formation 
      signaling, beyond DAF-11?
  - question: Does DAF-21 have distinct functions in germline versus somatic 
      tissues given its differential expression?
suggested_experiments:
  - description: Identify native DAF-21 client proteins by AP-MS. While some 
      clients are known (DAF-11, WEE-1.3), a systematic identification of native
      DAF-21 clients in C. elegans would clarify its cellular roles.
    hypothesis: DAF-21 interacts with multiple signal transduction proteins 
      beyond DAF-11
  - description: Determine tissue-specific requirements for DAF-21 using 
      tissue-specific RNAi. Understanding which tissues require DAF-21 for 
      viability and specific phenotypes would clarify its developmental roles.

      development
