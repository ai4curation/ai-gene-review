## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** H2KZZ2
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Helix-loop-helix protein 30 {ECO:0000305};
- **Gene Information:** Name=hlh-30 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:W02C12.3c}; ORFNames=W02C12.3 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:W02C12.3c};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the MiT/TFE family. .
- **Key Domains:** bHLH_dom. (IPR011598); HLH_DNA-bd_sf. (IPR036638); HLH (PF00010)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "hlh-30" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'hlh-30' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **hlh-30** (gene ID: hlh-30, UniProt: H2KZZ2) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status: All objectives completed. Below is a comprehensive, source-based research report on Caenorhabditis elegans hlh-30 (UniProt H2KZZ2), with priority to 2023–2024 literature when available.

Gene/protein identity verification and definition
- Identity and orthology: hlh-30 (W02C12.3) in C. elegans encodes a basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factor of the MiT/TFE family and is the functional ortholog of mammalian TFEB, the master regulator of lysosome biogenesis and autophagy; HLH-30 regulates expression of numerous autophagy–lysosomal genes and modulates longevity (Nature Communications, 2013; https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms3267; published Aug 2013) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 1-2, lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 2-4).
- Domain/family consistency: Sequence and functional data align with a bHLH DNA-binding protein acting similarly to TFEB, controlling a CLEAR-like transcriptional program in worms (Lapierre 2013) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 2-4, lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 1-2).

Key concepts and current understanding
- Core function: HLH-30 is a nutrient/stress-regulated transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus to activate autophagy and lysosome biogenesis genes, thereby promoting autophagic flux, proteostasis, and lifespan in C. elegans (Lapierre 2013) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 14-17, lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 2-4, lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 5-7).
- Pathway node: HLH-30 integrates TOR/mTOR nutrient signaling, mitochondrial stress inputs, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and epigenetic nutrient sensing to coordinate a conserved autophagy–lysosome program (Lapierre 2013; Liu 2020; Silvestrini 2018; Lim 2023) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 2-4, j.2020mitochondrialtranslationand pages 13-13, silvestrini2018nuclearexportinhibition pages 1-3, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 4-6).

Molecular mechanism and pathway placement
- Downstream program (CLEAR-like): HLH-30 directly or indirectly upregulates orthologs of TFEB targets across autophagy steps, including lgg-1/2 (LC3/GABARAP), sqst-1 (p62), fusion machinery (e.g., rab-7), lysosomal genes (lmp-1/LAMP-1; v-ATPase subunits vha-15/16/17; cathepsins) and sulfatases; promoters contain E-box/CLEAR-like motifs (Lapierre 2013) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 2-4, lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 5-7).
- Upstream regulation: (1) TOR/mTOR. Reduced TOR activity (tor RNAi) or long-lived states elevate nuclear HLH-30; hlh-30 is required for longevity from TOR inhibition (Lapierre 2013; https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms3267; Aug 2013) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 2-4, lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 14-17). (2) Nuclear export. The exportin XPO-1/XPO1 controls HLH-30 localization; xpo-1 knockdown or SINE compounds (e.g., KPT-330) increase nuclear HLH-30, autophagy, stress resistance, and lifespan independent of mTOR (Cell Reports, 2018; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.063; May 2018) (silvestrini2018nuclearexportinhibition pages 1-3, silvestrini2018nuclearexportinhibition pages 9-15). (3) HSP90/CDK5 arm. HSP90AA1 phosphorylation by CDK5 regulates TFEB binding and nuclear entry in cells; the study validates a role for HSP-90 in HLH-30-dependent starvation longevity in C. elegans (Autophagy, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2105561; Aug 2023) (yang2023regulationoftfeb pages 13-14). (4) Epigenetic nutrient sensing. Dietary restriction (DR) lowers SAMS-1 activity and SET-2–mediated H3K4me3, co-activating HLH-30 and PHA-4 at promoters of shared autophagy genes; SAM supplementation reverses HLH-30 nuclear translocation and target induction (Autophagy, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2068267; May 2023) (lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 2-4, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 4-6, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 13-14, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 11-13, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 6-7, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 14-15, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 1-2).
- Cross-talk: Mitochondrial translation/dynamics perturbations require HLH-30 to extend lifespan, linking mitochondrial stress to HLH-30 activation and lysosome biogenesis (J Cell Biol, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201907067; Dec 2020) (j.2020mitochondrialtranslationand pages 13-13).

Cellular localization and dynamics
- Canonical dynamics: In fed conditions, HLH-30 is predominantly cytosolic; starvation or longevity states induce nuclear accumulation in intestinal and hypodermal cells, correlating with autophagy gene activation (Lapierre 2013) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 2-4).
- mTOR-independent nuclearization: XPO-1 inhibition drives nuclear HLH-30 and autophagy without altering mTOR signaling, indicating a parallel control axis (Silvestrini 2018) (silvestrini2018nuclearexportinhibition pages 1-3, silvestrini2018nuclearexportinhibition pages 9-15).
- Neuronal physiology: In neurons, basal HLH-30 activity can expand lysosomal capacity without overt nuclear enrichment; HLH-30 loss impairs lysosomal function, slows synaptic vesicle protein turnover, and compromises dendrite maintenance during aging (bioRxiv preprint, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.29.625995; Nov 2024) (zhong2024tfebhlh30mediatedexpansionof pages 1-4).

Tissue/cell-type contexts of action
- Intestine and epidermis: HLH-30 acts in intestine and hypodermal seam cells to regulate autophagy and lysosomal programs; intestinal nuclear localization is prominent under TOR inhibition and in longevity mutants (Lapierre 2013) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 2-4, lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 14-17).
- Neurons: HLH-30 acts cell-intrinsically in early adult neurons to expand lysosomal capacity and maintain dendrites (Zhong & Richardson 2024) (zhong2024tfebhlh30mediatedexpansionof pages 1-4).

Biological processes and phenotypes (selected precise evidence)
- Autophagy and lysosome biogenesis: HLH-30 is required for autophagosome formation and autophagic flux in longevity models; hlh-30 loss reduces GFP::LGG-1 puncta and increases SQST-1 foci; overexpression increases puncta and extends lifespan (Lapierre 2013) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 2-4, lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 5-7).
- Proteostasis and neurotoxic protein clearance: In Aβ transgenic worms, Aβ activates mTOR, reduces HLH-30 nuclear entry, and impairs autophagy; HLH-30 elevates v-ATPase and cathepsins, increases autophagic flux, reduces Aβ, and improves paralysis; small molecules (saikosaponin B2, hypericin) act as HLH-30 activators (Frontiers in Pharmacology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2024.1433030; Aug 2024) (lin2024hlh30tfebmodulatesautophagy pages 4-9).
- Innate immunity and toxin tolerance: HLH-30 mediates cell-autonomous epithelial defense against bacterial pore-forming toxins via xenophagic degradation and membrane repair; activation is HLH-30-dependent (Autophagy, 2017; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2016.1256933; Dec 2016) (lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 13-14). HLH-30 contributes to tolerance to enterohemorrhagic E. coli, with genetic evidence placing hlh-30 downstream of tolerance-conferring mutations (Genetics, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyaa052; Jan 2021) (lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 11-13). Host–commensal interactions can extend lifespan via HLH-30-dependent autophagy (Aging, 2021; https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202885; Mar 2021) (lin2024hlh30tfebmodulatesautophagy pages 4-9).
- Starvation survival and quiescence: HLH-30 is necessary for transcriptional reprogramming and chromatin reorganization during starvation-induced quiescence; it collaborates with DAF-16/FOXO to ensure survival and to prevent inappropriate developmental progression (bioRxiv preprint, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.31.685810; Nov 2025) (munozbarrera2025hlh30tfebisnecessary pages 1-5).
- Longevity: hlh-30 is required for lifespan extension in at least six longevity paradigms (germline loss, TOR inhibition, DR/eat-2, insulin/IGF-1 signaling reduction, reduced mitochondrial respiration, reduced translation), and HLH-30 overexpression extends lifespan by ~15–20% (Lapierre 2013) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 5-7, lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 14-17). Lifespan extension by inhibiting nuclear export (xpo-1 RNAi or SINEs) requires hlh-30 (Silvestrini 2018) (silvestrini2018nuclearexportinhibition pages 1-3, silvestrini2018nuclearexportinhibition pages 9-15). Mitochondrial translation/dynamics synergy to extend lifespan is also HLH-30-dependent (Liu 2020) (j.2020mitochondrialtranslationand pages 13-13).

Interactions with other transcriptional regulators and pathways
- DAF-16/FOXO: HLH-30 and DAF-16 cooperate in starvation survival and, in late-life tubular lysosome induction models, form a regulatory axis for lysosomal morphology and proteostasis; genetic epistasis indicates cooperation for pro-health effects (Research Square preprint, 2024; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4049366/v1; Mar 2024) and in quiescence (Muñoz-Barrera 2025 preprint) (munozbarrera2025hlh30tfebisnecessary pages 1-5, yang2023regulationoftfeb pages 13-14).
- PHA-4/FOXA: Under DR, SAMS-1/SET-2–mediated H3K4me3 reduction co-activates HLH-30 and PHA-4 at common target promoters; both are required for DR-induced autophagy and longevity (Lim 2023) (lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 4-6, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 11-13, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 2-4).
- Mitochondrial stress: HLH-30 is the key transcriptional effector connecting mitochondrial translation/dynamics perturbations to enhanced lysosome biogenesis and lifespan (Liu 2020) (j.2020mitochondrialtranslationand pages 13-13).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 focus)
- HSP90/CDK5 control of TFEB/HLH-30: HSP90AA1 phosphorylation by CDK5 modulates TFEB binding and nuclear localization; in worms, HSP-90 participates in starvation longevity via HLH-30, highlighting conserved chaperone–TFEB regulation (Autophagy, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2105561; Aug 2023) (yang2023regulationoftfeb pages 13-14).
- Epigenetic DR axis: SAMS-1/SET-2 H3K4me3 module coordinates HLH-30 and PHA-4 to drive autophagy and longevity; SAM rescues HLH-30 nuclear translocation and gene induction, providing a nutrient–epigenome–TF axis (Autophagy, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2068267; May 2023) (lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 2-4, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 4-6).
- Neuronal lysosomal capacity and aging: HLH-30 acts cell-autonomously in neurons to expand lysosomal capacity in early adulthood, maintaining dendrites with age, and can act basally without robust nuclear enrichment (bioRxiv preprint, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.29.625995; Nov 2024) (zhong2024tfebhlh30mediatedexpansionof pages 1-4).
- Neurodegeneration model application: In Aβ transgenic worms, HLH-30 restores autophagic flux and reduces proteotoxicity; candidate activators identified (Frontiers in Pharmacology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2024.1433030; Aug 2024) (lin2024hlh30tfebmodulatesautophagy pages 4-9).

Current applications and translational/real-world implementations
- Nuclear export inhibitors (SINEs): Pharmacological XPO1 inhibitors (e.g., KPT-330) increase TFEB/HLH-30 nuclear localization, enhance autophagy/lysosomal biogenesis in worms and human cells, extend worm lifespan, and ameliorate neurodegeneration in an ALS fly model, indicating cross-species therapeutic potential for autophagy enhancement (Silvestrini 2018; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.063; May 2018) (silvestrini2018nuclearexportinhibition pages 9-15).
- Dietary/epigenetic modulation: Dietary SAM manipulations modulate HLH-30 localization and autophagy gene induction in sams-1 mutants, pointing to nutritional/epigenetic levers to engage HLH-30 (Lim 2023) (lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 2-4, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 4-6).
- Microbiota interventions: Heat-inactivated Lactobacillus fermentum BGHV110 extends lifespan via HLH-30-dependent autophagy, suggesting probiotic components can engage HLH-30-mediated healthspan pathways (Aging, 2021; https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202885; Mar 2021) (lin2024hlh30tfebmodulatesautophagy pages 4-9).
- Neurodegenerative disease models: HLH-30 activation improves proteostasis in Aβ worms, nominating TFEB/HLH-30 as a target for amyloid clearance strategies (Lin 2024) (lin2024hlh30tfebmodulatesautophagy pages 4-9).

Quantitative statistics and key data points
- Lifespan: HLH-30 overexpression extends mean lifespan by ~15–20% in worms; hlh-30 is required for lifespan extension in six distinct longevity paradigms (Lapierre 2013) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 5-7). xpo-1 knockdown or SINE treatment extends lifespan in a manner dependent on hlh-30 (Silvestrini 2018) (silvestrini2018nuclearexportinhibition pages 1-3, silvestrini2018nuclearexportinhibition pages 9-15).
- Autophagy readouts: hlh-30 loss reduces GFP::LGG-1 puncta and increases SQST-1 foci; HLH-30 overexpression increases puncta; sams-1 and set-2 mutants increase autophagic flux measured by GFP::LGG-1::mCherry dual reporter; SAM rescues (Lapierre 2013; Lim 2023) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 5-7, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 2-4, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 4-6).
- Neuronal maintenance: HLH-30 loss delays synaptic vesicle protein turnover and accelerates dendrite degeneration with age, supporting a basal neuronal role in lysosomal capacity (Zhong & Richardson 2024 preprint) (zhong2024tfebhlh30mediatedexpansionof pages 1-4).
- Aβ proteostasis: HLH-30 activation elevates lysosomal genes (v-ATPase, cathepsins), increases autophagic flux, reduces ROS, and decreases paralysis rates in Aβ worms (Lin 2024) (lin2024hlh30tfebmodulatesautophagy pages 4-9).

Expert perspectives and analysis
- HLH-30 is a central, conserved node that converts nutrient, stress, and organelle-status inputs into a coordinated autophagy–lysosome transcriptional program, with demonstrable organismal benefits on stress resistance and longevity; multiple upstream levers (TOR, exportin-1, chaperone phosphorylation, epigenetic SAM/H3K4) provide orthogonal intervention points (Lapierre 2013; Silvestrini 2018; Lim 2023; Yang 2023) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 14-17, silvestrini2018nuclearexportinhibition pages 1-3, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 4-6, yang2023regulationoftfeb pages 13-14). The 2023–2024 advances particularly underscore epigenetic coordination with PHA-4/FOXA and neuronal homeostatic roles that may not rely on dramatic nuclear translocation, implying tissue-specific regimes of HLH-30 control and dosage-sensitive basal activity (Lim 2023; Zhong & Richardson 2024) (lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 4-6, zhong2024tfebhlh30mediatedexpansionof pages 1-4).

Notes on gene symbol ambiguity
- The symbol hlh-30 is sometimes used generically for bHLH factors across species; here all functional statements and evidence refer specifically to C. elegans hlh-30 (W02C12.3), consistent with UniProt H2KZZ2 and the MiT/TFE bHLH family identity (Lapierre 2013) (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 1-2, lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 2-4).

Conclusion
- The C. elegans transcription factor HLH-30 (H2KZZ2) is the TFEB ortholog that orchestrates a CLEAR-like autophagy–lysosome program downstream of nutrient, stress, chaperone, nucleocytoplasmic transport, mitochondrial, and epigenetic inputs. It acts prominently in the intestine and epidermis and has a physiologically important basal role in neurons. HLH-30 is central to starvation survival, proteostasis, innate immunity/tolerance, and longevity, and multiple recent studies reveal actionable levers—exportin inhibition, dietary SAM modulation, and small-molecule activation—that demonstrate translational potential for enhancing autophagy and cellular clearance pathways (lapierre2013thetfeborthologue pages 14-17, silvestrini2018nuclearexportinhibition pages 1-3, lim2023sams1coordinateshlh30tfeb pages 4-6, lin2024hlh30tfebmodulatesautophagy pages 4-9, zhong2024tfebhlh30mediatedexpansionof pages 1-4).
