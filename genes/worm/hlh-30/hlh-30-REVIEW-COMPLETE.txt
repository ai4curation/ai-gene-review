HLH-30 GO ANNOTATION REVIEW - COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY
Gene: hlh-30 (Helix-loop-helix protein 30)
UniProt: H2KZZ2
Organism: Caenorhabditis elegans (worm, CAEEL)
Review Date: 2025-12-29
================================================================================

REVIEW STATUS: COMPLETE

All 42 GO annotations from genes/worm/hlh-30/hlh-30-goa.tsv have been
systematically reviewed with evidence-based curation actions assigned.

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

HLH-30 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian TFEB (Transcription Factor EB),
a master transcriptional regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. The
existing GO annotation set is comprehensive, well-supported by literature
evidence, and appropriately specific.

The review identifies a coherent functional model:
- HLH-30 is a bHLH transcription factor that forms homodimers
- It dynamically shuttles between cytoplasm (fed state) and nucleus (stress/starvation)
- In the nucleus, it activates CLEAR-like promoter elements in target genes
- Core targets: autophagy genes (lgg-1/2, atg-18, sqst-1), lysosomal genes
  (lmp-1, v-ATPase subunits, cathepsins), lipase genes, and immune genes
- Through these targets, HLH-30 coordinates:
  * Autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis
  * Lipolysis during nutrient limitation
  * Defense against bacterial pathogens (especially S. aureus)
  * Lifespan extension across multiple paradigms

================================================================================
DETAILED ACTIONS BY CATEGORY
================================================================================

1. ACCEPT - ALL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ACTIVITY ANNOTATIONS (6 annotations)
   ✓ GO:0000981 - DNA-binding TF activity, RNA Pol II-specific (IBA, ISS, IEA)
   ✓ GO:0000978 - RNA Pol II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific binding (IBA)
   ✓ GO:0003677 - DNA binding (IEA)
   ✓ GO:0006357 - Regulation of transcription by RNA Pol II (IBA, IDA)
   ✓ GO:0045944 - Positive regulation of transcription by RNA Pol II (IMP)
   ✓ GO:0046983 - Protein dimerization activity (IEA)

   Rationale: Core molecular function. bHLH domain architecture supports
   homodimerization. Multiple evidence types converge on transcription factor
   activity. TFEB orthology well-established.

2. ACCEPT - ALL CELLULAR LOCALIZATION ANNOTATIONS (11 annotations)
   ✓ GO:0005634 - nucleus (6 distinct annotations: IBA, IEA, IDA×4)
   ✓ GO:0005737 - cytoplasm (5 distinct annotations: IEA, IDA×4)

   Rationale: HLH-30 exhibits dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling behavior.
   Fed conditions = cytoplasmic (basal state). Stress/starvation/longevity =
   nuclear accumulation. Multiple independent IDA studies confirm localization
   changes across tissues (intestine, epidermis, neurons). Direct observation
   via GFP fusion proteins.

3. ACCEPT - AUTOPHAGY REGULATION ANNOTATIONS (1 annotation)
   ✓ GO:0016239 - Positive regulation of macroautophagy (IMP)

   Rationale: Core function with definitive evidence from Lapierre et al. 2013.
   hlh-30 loss reduces GFP::LGG-1 punctae; overexpression increases them.
   HLH-30 required for autophagy induction across multiple stress contexts
   (heat stress, starvation, longevity).

   NOTE: See MODIFY section for related GO:0010506

4. ACCEPT - LONGEVITY/LIFESPAN ANNOTATIONS (3 annotations)
   ✓ GO:0008340 - Determination of adult lifespan (IMP×2, IGI×1)

   Rationale: Seminal Lapierre et al. 2013 (Nature Communications) demonstrates
   hlh-30 is essential for lifespan extension in 6 mechanistically distinct
   paradigms:
     1. Germline loss (glp-1)
     2. TOR inhibition (let-363/tor)
     3. Dietary restriction (eat-2)
     4. Reduced insulin/IGF signaling (daf-2)
     5. Mitochondrial stress (clk-1)
     6. Reduced protein synthesis (rsks-1)

   HLH-30 overexpression extends lifespan by 15-20%. This is among the strongest
   and most reproducible longevity functions in C. elegans. Core function.

5. ACCEPT - INNATE IMMUNITY/DEFENSE ANNOTATIONS (10 annotations)
   ✓ GO:0050830 - Defense response to Gram-positive bacterium (8 distinct)
   ✓ GO:0097237 - Cellular response to toxic substance (1)
   ✓ GO:1904417 - Positive regulation of xenophagy (1)
   ✓ GO:1905686 - Positive regulation of plasma membrane repair (1)

   Rationale:

   GO:0050830 (Gram-positive defense): Extensively validated. HLH-30 is
   activated within hours of Staphylococcus aureus infection (Visvikis et al.
   2014) and drives ~80% of host defense genes. Multiple evidence types
   (IMP, IEP, IGI) across different bacterial challenges (S. aureus,
   pore-forming toxins). Core function.

   GO:0097237 (Toxin response): Chen et al. 2017 demonstrated HLH-30-dependent
   autophagy activation in response to bacterial pore-forming toxins
   (Cry5B, Cry21A from Bt). Specific, well-characterized mechanism.

   GO:1904417 (Xenophagy): Chen et al. 2017 showed HLH-30-dependent xenophagic
   degradation of internalized bacterial toxins. Colocalization of toxin with
   LGG-1 punctae confirmed. Specific selective autophagy mechanism.

   GO:1905686 (Membrane repair): Chen et al. 2017 demonstrated HLH-30-dependent
   autophagy contributes to membrane pore repair after toxin-induced damage.
   Distinct but mechanistically linked to xenophagy.

6. ACCEPT - GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION ANNOTATIONS (2 annotations)
   ✓ GO:0006351 - DNA-templated transcription (IEA)
   ✓ GO:0006357 - Regulation of transcription by RNA Pol II (IDA)

   Rationale: General but accurate annotations for transcription factor.
   Complementary to more specific regulation-of-transcription terms.

7. KEEP_AS_NON_CORE (2 annotations)
   ↺ GO:0050829 - Defense response to Gram-negative bacterium (2 IMP from PMID:24882217)

   Rationale: While present in PMID:24882217 (Visvikis et al. 2014), the
   study's primary focus was S. aureus (Gram-positive), a true pathogen causing
   active infection. Gram-negative bacteria (like E. coli) are normal C. elegans
   microbiota. HLH-30's primary role is defense against pathogens breaching
   epithelial barrier. Gram-negative function appears secondary/indirect.
   Later evidence (Tsai et al. 2021) shows HLH-30 role in tolerance to
   EHEC (a commensal interaction), not active defense.

   Action: Keep annotation but flag as NON-CORE to distinguish primary
   (Gram-positive/pathogenic) from secondary (Gram-negative/commensal) roles.
   Do NOT remove - evidence is valid, just appropriately classified.

8. MODIFY (1 annotation)
   ✗ GO:0010506 - Regulation of autophagy (IMP from PMID:23925298)
   → GO:0016239 - Positive regulation of macroautophagy

   Rationale: GO:0010506 is bidirectional ("regulation" could mean positive
   or negative). Evidence is unambiguous for POSITIVE regulation:
   - hlh-30 loss → reduced GFP::LGG-1 punctae (decreased autophagy)
   - HLH-30 overexpression → increased punctae (enhanced autophagy)

   GO:0016239 is more specific, informative, and accurately captures HLH-30's
   directionality. GO:0016239 already exists in the annotation set, making
   GO:0010506 redundant.

   Action: Replace GO:0010506 with GO:0016239
   Note: Already documented in ai-review.yaml (lines 593-603)

================================================================================
NEW ANNOTATIONS (3)
================================================================================

These three annotations are well-supported by literature but missing from the
original GOA file. Should be added to complete the annotation set.

1. NEW: GO:0007040 - Lysosome organization (IMP from PMID:23925298)

   Evidence:
   - Lapierre et al. 2013 identified HLH-30-regulated lysosomal genes:
     * lmp-1/LAMP-1 (lysosomal membrane protein)
     * vha-15, vha-16, vha-17 (v-ATPase subunits for acidification)
     * Cathepsins (lysosomal hydrolases)
   - Deep research confirms HLH-30 coordinates lysosomal biogenesis with autophagy

   Rationale:
   - Lysosome biogenesis is a DEFINING function of TFEB orthologs
   - Direct evidence for HLH-30 regulation of lysosomal genes
   - Missing from original GOA despite clear literature support
   - GO:0007040 appropriately specific (parent GO:0006996 too broad)

   Status: ACCEPT as NEW

2. NEW: GO:0019217 - Regulation of fatty acid metabolic process (IMP from PMID:23604316)

   Evidence:
   - O'Rourke & Ruvkun 2013: "MXL-3 and HLH-30 transcriptionally link
     lipolysis and autophagy to nutrient availability"
   - HLH-30 directly activates lipase genes: lipl-1, lipl-2, lipl-3, lipl-5
   - Nuclear translocation during fasting coordinates lipolysis with autophagy

   Rationale:
   - Lipid mobilization is coordinated with autophagy during nutrient limitation
   - Direct transcriptional activation of lipase genes demonstrated
   - Essential for energy provision during starvation (β-oxidation fuels autophagy)
   - Missing from original GOA despite mechanistic characterization
   - GO:0019217 appropriately specific (parent GO:0006629 too general)

   Status: ACCEPT as NEW

3. NEW: GO:0009267 - Cellular response to starvation (IMP from PMID:23604316, PMID:23925298)

   Evidence:
   - Lapierre et al. 2013: HLH-30 translocates to nucleus during starvation
   - O'Rourke & Ruvkun 2013: HLH-30 activates coordinated autophagy-lipolysis
     response to nutrient limitation
   - Lim et al. 2023 (deep research): SAMS-1/SET-2 epigenetic pathway
     co-activates HLH-30 and PHA-4/FOXA during dietary restriction
   - Muñoz-Barrera 2025 (deep research): HLH-30 required for transcriptional
     reprogramming and chromatin reorganization during starvation-induced quiescence

   Rationale:
   - HLH-30 is a nutrient sensor essential for starvation response
   - Coordinates autophagy, lipolysis, and lysosomal biogenesis during nutrient
     limitation
   - Required for survival through starvation (essential for quiescence maintenance)
   - TFEB similarly responds to nutrient depletion in mammals (conserved)
   - Missing from original GOA despite extensive literature support
   - GO:0009267 appropriately specific for starvation-specific response

   Status: ACCEPT as NEW

   Confidence: Medium
   Evidence: IMP (but indirect, commensal vs. pathogen)
   Status: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

================================================================================
TISSUE-SPECIFIC CONTEXTS
================================================================================

INTESTINE:
- Primary site of autophagy-lysosomal regulation
- Nuclear translocation prominent under TOR inhibition
- Coordinates host defense during bacterial infection
- Integrates nutrient sensing (TOR, amino acids)

EPIDERMIS (seam cells):
- Contributes to autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis
- Participates in defense responses
- Shared regulation with intestine

NEURONS:
- Basal HLH-30 activity expands lysosomal capacity
- Maintains dendrite integrity with age
- Protects synaptic protein turnover
- May operate without dramatic nuclear translocation
  (different from intestine/epidermis)

================================================================================
UPSTREAM REGULATION PATHWAYS
================================================================================

HLH-30 nuclear localization is controlled by multiple converging pathways:

1. TOR/mTOR Nutrient Sensing
   - Reduced TOR activity → increased nuclear HLH-30
   - Essential for longevity from TOR inhibition

2. Nuclear Export (XPO-1/Exportin-1)
   - XPO-1 mediates HLH-30 cytoplasmic retention
   - XPO-1 inhibitors (SINEs) increase nuclear HLH-30
   - Independent of TOR signaling (parallel axis)

3. HSP90/CDK5 Chaperone Pathway
   - HSP90AA1 phosphorylation by CDK5 regulates TFEB
   - Involved in starvation longevity response

4. PLC-PKD Signaling (Infection Response)
   - Bacterial infection activates PLC → PKD (dkf-1)
   - dkf-1 required for HLH-30 nuclear translocation
   - Conserved between C. elegans and mammals

5. Epigenetic SAMS-1/SET-2 Nutrient Sensing
   - Dietary restriction lowers SAMS-1 activity
   - Reduced H3K4me3 co-activates HLH-30 and PHA-4/FOXA
   - SAM supplementation reverses HLH-30 translocation
   - Nutrient-epigenome-transcription factor axis

This regulatory complexity provides multiple intervention points for
therapeutic targeting of autophagy/lysosomal pathways.
