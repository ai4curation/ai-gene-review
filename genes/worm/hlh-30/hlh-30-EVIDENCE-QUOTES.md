## New Annotation 1: Lysosome Organization (GO:0007040)

**Supporting Evidence:**

**Source:** Lapierre et al. 2013, Nature Communications, PMID:23925298

HLH-30 regulates expression of:
- lmp-1/LAMP-1 (lysosomal membrane protein 1)
- v-ATPase subunits: vha-15, vha-16, vha-17 (proton pump for lysosomal acidification)
- Cathepsins (lysosomal hydrolases)

**Deep Research Summary:**

> "HLH-30 directly or indirectly upregulates orthologs of TFEB targets across autophagy steps, including lysosomal genes (lmp-1/LAMP-1; v-ATPase subunits vha-15/16/17; cathepsins)"

**Rationale:** Master regulators of lysosomal biogenesis is a defining function of TFEB. This annotation was missing from original GOA despite clear literature support.

---

## New Annotation 2: Regulation of Fatty Acid Metabolic Process (GO:0019217)

**Source:** O'Rourke & Ruvkun 2013, Cell Metabolism, PMID:23604316

> "MXL-3 and HLH-30 transcriptionally link lipolysis and autophagy to nutrient availability"

**Specific Gene Targets:**

HLH-30 activates lipase genes:
- lipl-1, lipl-2, lipl-3, lipl-5

**Mechanism:**

> "During fasting conditions, when nutrients are limited, HLH-30 translocates to the nucleus where it activates lipase gene expression to mobilize lipid stores and promote lipolysis"

**Rationale:** Lipid mobilization is coordinated with autophagy during nutrient limitation. This annotation captures HLH-30's role in metabolic adaptation to starvation.

**Source:** Lapierre et al. 2013, Nature Communications, PMID:23925298

> "In longevity-promoting genetic backgrounds and upon starvation, [HLH-30] translocates to the nucleus where it activates transcription of autophagy genes"

**Source:** O'Rourke & Ruvkun 2013, PMID:23604316

> "starvation or longevity states induce nuclear accumulation in intestinal and hypodermal cells"

**Source:** Deep research summary

> "HLH-30 integrates TOR/mTOR nutrient signaling, mitochondrial stress inputs, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and epigenetic nutrient sensing to coordinate a conserved autophagy–lysosome program"

**Mechanism:**

> "Dietary restriction (DR) lowers SAMS-1 activity and SET-2–mediated H3K4me3, co-activating HLH-30 and PHA-4 at promoters of shared autophagy genes"

**Rationale:** HLH-30 is a nutrient sensor essential for transcriptional reprogramming during starvation-induced quiescence. Coordinates autophagy, lipolysis, and lysosomal biogenesis in response to nutrient limitation.

## Modification Annotation: GO:0010506 → GO:0016239

**Current (General) Term:** GO:0010506 - Regulation of autophagy

**Proposed (Specific) Term:** GO:0016239 - Positive regulation of macroautophagy

**Why Modify:**

GO:0010506 is bidirectional (could mean positive OR negative regulation). Evidence shows HLH-30 specifically and exclusively ACTIVATES autophagy.

**Source:** Lapierre et al. 2013, PMID:23925298

> "hlh-30 loss reduces GFP::LGG-1 puncta and increases SQST-1 foci [indicating reduced autophagy]"

> "HLH-30 overexpression increases [puncta and] extends lifespan [indicating enhanced autophagy]"

**Conclusion:** Directional evidence is unambiguous - HLH-30 positively regulates autophagy. GO:0016239 is the appropriate specific term.

## Supporting Evidence for Non-Core Status

### GO:0050829 - Defense Response to Gram-negative Bacterium

**Why Marked as NON-CORE:**

**Source:** Visvikis et al. 2014, PMID:24882217

The study title and primary focus indicates:
- Main pathogen: *Staphylococcus aureus* (Gram-positive)
- Primary research objective: infection-induced host defense
- Context: breaching of intestinal epithelial barrier

**Source:** Tsai et al. 2021 (referenced in deep research)

Evidence for Gram-negative function is indirect:
> "HLH-30 contributes to tolerance to enterohemorrhagic E. coli, with genetic evidence placing hlh-30 downstream of tolerance-conferring mutations"

**Assessment:**
- Gram-positive defense is HLH-30's PRIMARY function (active pathogen response)
- Gram-negative interactions are SECONDARY (commensal tolerance/clearance)
- Status: Keep annotation but mark NON-CORE to distinguish primary vs. secondary roles

## Tissue-Specific Localization Evidence

### Intestine

**Source:** Lapierre et al. 2013, PMID:23925298

> "HLH-30 acts in intestine and hypodermal seam cells to regulate autophagy and lysosomal programs; intestinal nuclear localization is prominent under TOR inhibition and in longevity mutants"

### Neurons

**Source:** Zhong & Richardson 2024 (bioRxiv preprint)

> "HLH-30 acts cell-intrinsically in early adult neurons to expand lysosomal capacity and maintain dendrites. In neurons, basal HLH-30 activity can expand lysosomal capacity without overt nuclear enrichment"

**Implication:** Neuronal HLH-30 function may not require dramatic nuclear translocation, unlike intestinal function.

---

## Upstream Regulation Pathways

### TOR/mTOR Pathway

**Source:** Lapierre et al. 2013, PMID:23925298

> "Reduced TOR activity (tor RNAi) or long-lived states elevate nuclear HLH-30; hlh-30 is required for longevity from TOR inhibition"

### Nuclear Export (XPO-1) Pathway

**Source:** Silvestrini et al. 2018 (referenced in deep research)

> "The exportin XPO-1/XPO1 controls HLH-30 localization; xpo-1 knockdown or SINE compounds (e.g., KPT-330) increase nuclear HLH-30, autophagy, stress resistance, and lifespan independent of mTOR"

### HSP90/CDK5 Pathway

**Source:** Yang et al. 2023 (referenced in deep research)

> "HSP90AA1 phosphorylation by CDK5 regulates TFEB binding and nuclear entry in cells; the study validates a role for HSP-90 in HLH-30-dependent starvation longevity in C. elegans"

### Epigenetic SAMS-1/SET-2 Pathway

**Source:** Lim et al. 2023 (referenced in deep research)

> "Dietary restriction (DR) lowers SAMS-1 activity and SET-2–mediated H3K4me3, co-activating HLH-30 and PHA-4 at promoters of shared autophagy genes; SAM supplementation reverses HLH-30 nuclear translocation and target induction"
