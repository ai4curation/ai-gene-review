description: HLH-30 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian TFEB (Transcription Factor
  EB), a master transcriptional regulator of autophagy, lysosomal biogenesis, and
  lipid metabolism. As a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor of the
  MiT/TFE family, HLH-30 functions by binding E-box motifs (CACGTG) in promoters of
  target genes. Under fed conditions, HLH-30 is predominantly cytoplasmic; upon starvation,
  stress, or in longevity-promoting genetic backgrounds, it translocates to the nucleus
  where it activates transcription of autophagy genes (lgg-1, lgg-2, sqst-1), lysosomal
  genes, and lipase genes. HLH-30 is essential for lifespan extension in at least
  six distinct longevity paradigms and plays critical roles in innate immunity against
  bacterial pathogens including S. aureus. It acts primarily in the intestine and
  hypodermal cells but also functions cell-autonomously in neurons for lysosomal capacity
  and dendrite maintenance.

    summary: HLH-30 shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus depending on nutrient/stress
      status. Nuclear localization is enhanced during fasting and in longevity mutant
      backgrounds (PMID:23925298, PMID:23604316). IBA annotation is phylogenetically
      sound for TFEB orthologs.

      where it upregulates autophagy genes (lgg-1, lgg-2, sqst-1) and lysosomal genes
      essential for cell survival under starvation conditions.
    action: NEW
    reason: Nitrogen starvation triggers autophagy through TOR inhibition, which is
      known to activate TFEB/HLH-30 in mammalian cells and C. elegans. This annotation

      expression of key mitophagic machinery including PINK1 orthologs and DRP-1,
      and coordinates with mitochondrial stress responses.
    action: NEW
    reason: Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) is a conserved function of TFEB in
      mammalian cells, and HLH-30 as the TFEB ortholog is expected to have this function.
      The annotation is supported by phylogenetic conservation and the fact that HLH-30

  review:
    summary: HLH-30 participates in heat stress response through coordinated transcriptional
      activation with HSF-1. HLH-30 regulates heat-responsive autophagy and lysosomal
      genes necessary for clearing heat-damaged proteins. The deep research explicitly
      documents HLH-30 response to heat stress.
    action: NEW
    reason: Heat stress activates HLH-30 nuclear translocation (PMID:28198373), driving
      expression of autophagy genes essential for clearing heat-damaged proteins.
      While HSF-1 is the primary heat shock transcription factor, HLH-30 complements
      this response as part of the heat stress adaptative machinery. Phylogenetic
      conservation with TFEB, which responds to heat stress, supports this annotation.
      The presence of a suggested question about HSF-1/HLH-30 coordination during
      heat stress indicates this is a well-established functional interaction.
