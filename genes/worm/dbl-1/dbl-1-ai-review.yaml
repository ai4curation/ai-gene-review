description: DBL-1 (Dpp and BMP-Like 1) is the C. elegans homolog of Drosophila 
  decapentaplegic (dpp) and vertebrate BMP2/4 proteins. It is a secreted 
  TGF-beta superfamily ligand that acts as a dose-dependent regulator of body 
  size and male tail patterning. DBL-1 is expressed primarily in neurons 
  (including ventral cord neurons, CAN cells, and M lineage pharyngeal neurons) 
  and signals in a paracrine manner to the hypodermis through the SMA-6 type I 
  receptor and DAF-4 type II receptor, activating downstream SMAD proteins 
  (SMA-2, SMA-3, SMA-4). Beyond its core growth-regulatory functions, DBL-1 
  plays roles in innate immunity (regulating antimicrobial peptide expression in
  response to fungal and bacterial infection), lipid metabolism (via crosstalk 
  with insulin/IGF-1 signaling), aversive olfactory learning, and gland cell 
  morphology.

    review:
      summary: DBL-1 functions as a secreted signaling molecule similar to 
        cytokines, activating receptor-mediated signaling cascades. As a 
        TGF-beta/BMP superfamily member, it acts as a paracrine signal from 
        neurons to hypodermal cells. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically 
        sound given DBL-1's membership in the TGF-beta superfamily.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: DBL-1 is a secreted signaling ligand that activates 
        receptor-mediated pathways, consistent with cytokine activity. The IBA 
        annotation correctly captures this molecular function based on 
        phylogenetic inference from BMP family members.

      summary: DBL-1 is a secreted protein that signals from neurons to

        it is processed and secreted to act on target cells expressing cognate

      action: ACCEPT
      reason: DBL-1 is established as a secreted ligand that acts 
        non-cell-autonomously. UniProt annotation indicates "Secreted"

    review:
      summary: PMID:12051826 demonstrates lon-1 is a downstream target of DBL-1 
        signaling that regulates body size. Genetic analysis shows lon-1 acts 
        downstream of dbl-1 in the Sma/Mab pathway.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Genetic interactions between dbl-1 and lon-1 confirm DBL-1's role 
        in body size regulation. lon-1 mRNA is up-regulated when dbl-1 signaling
        is reduced, showing negative regulation by the pathway.

      metabolism?
  - question: What is the mechanism by which DBL-1 signals through both 
      Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways?
  - question: How is DBL-1 activity regulated at the level of ligand processing 
      and secretion?
