### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** G5EEL5
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Protein dbl-1 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=Dpp and BMP-like protein 1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9847238}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=dbl-1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:T25F10.2}; Synonyms=cet-1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:10021351}; ORFNames=T25F10.2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:T25F10.2};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the TGF-beta family.
- **Key Domains:** Cystine-knot_cytokine. (IPR029034); TGF-b_C. (IPR001839); TGF-beta-rel. (IPR015615); TGFb_CS. (IPR017948); TGF_beta (PF00019)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "dbl-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'dbl-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **dbl-1** (gene ID: dbl-1, UniProt: G5EEL5) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: dbl-1 (DBL-1) in Caenorhabditis elegans (UniProt G5EEL5)

Executive verification of identity
- Gene/protein match: dbl-1 encodes DBL-1, a Dpp/BMP2/4-like ligand of the TGF-β superfamily in C. elegans. Canonical signaling proceeds through the type II receptor DAF-4 and type I receptor SMA-6, activating R-Smads SMA-2/SMA-3 and the Co-Smad SMA-4, consistent with a cystine-knot BMP family ligand. The organism and pathway membership align with the UniProt context and WormBook/Frontiers reviews (https://doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.22.2, Jul 2013; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2023.1220068, Sep 2023) (gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 3-5, gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 8-10, gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 7-8, yamamoto2023tgfβpathwaysin pages 3-4).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Core pathway: DBL-1 is a secreted BMP-like ligand that binds a heterotetramer of DAF-4 (type II) and SMA-6 (type I) serine/threonine kinase receptors. Type II phosphorylates the type I GS domain, which in turn phosphorylates R-Smads (SMA-2, SMA-3). R-Smad/Co-Smad (SMA-4) complexes accumulate in nuclei to regulate transcription. Schnurri SMA-9 is a nuclear partner that imparts specificity to Sma/Mab outputs (https://doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.22.2, Jul 2013) (gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 3-5, gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 8-10, gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 7-8).
- Expression and localization: dbl-1 is expressed in cholinergic neurons in head and ventral/dorsal nerve cords; the signal is secreted to act in peripheral tissues. Receptors and Smads are expressed prominently in the hypodermis (epidermis), pharynx, and intestine, consistent with hypodermal control of body morphology and roles in immunity and metabolism (https://doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.22.2; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2023.1220068) (gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 8-10, gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 7-8, yamamoto2023tgfβpathwaysin pages 3-4).
- Biological scope: The Sma/Mab (small body size/male tail abnormal) pathway is nonessential for viability, facilitating genetic analysis; it regulates body size, cuticle/ECM organization, male tail morphogenesis, innate immunity, aspects of reproductive aging and metabolism (https://doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.22.2; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2023.1220068) (gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 3-5, gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 7-8).

2) Recent developments (2023–2024 prioritized)
- SMOC-1 mechanistic dual regulation: The sole C. elegans SMOC (SMOC-1) physically binds both LON-2/glypican and the mature DBL-1 ligand, and can bind them simultaneously. The EC domain mediates LON-2 binding, while full-length SMOC-1 is required for binding to DBL-1. Functionally, SMOC-1 acts negatively via LON-2 and positively via DBL-1, providing a mechanistic basis for context-dependent BMP modulation (PLOS Biology, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002272) (degroot2023smoc1interactswith pages 1-2).
- Cross-subfamily ligand interactions in immunity: C. elegans possesses five TGF-β ligands. The BMP-like DBL-1 and TIG-2 function independently in innate immune survival against pathogens, while BMP-like TIG-2 and Activin-like TIG-3 function together; structural modeling supports TIG-2/TIG-3 heterodimers. Canonical DBL-1/BMP receptors and Smads are required for bacterial pathogen responses, distinguishing BMP from DAF-7/Activin roles (PLOS Genetics, Jun 2024, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011324) (degroot2023smoc1interactswith pages 1-2, yamamoto2023tgfβpathwaysin pages 3-4).
- Updated synthesis for aging/immunity: A 2023 review summarizes DBL-1’s roles in aging and immunity, reiterating secretion from neurons, action in hypodermis, and expanded functions in host defense (Frontiers in Genetics, Sep 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2023.1220068) (yamamoto2023tgfβpathwaysin pages 3-4).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- ECM barrier and anesthetic sensitivity assays: Altering DBL-1 dosage modulates cuticle barrier function, drug permeability, and aggregation behavior in liquid. Loss of DBL-1 increases sensitivity to anesthetics; increased DBL-1 reduces sensitivity. These phenotypes are used as readouts for ECM organization and barrier integrity in vivo (PLoS ONE, Jul 2014, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101929) (schultz2014regulationofextracellular pages 1-2).
- Genetic reporters and trans-tissue signaling: The field uses RAD-SMAD reporters and hypodermal expression manipulations to dissect DBL-1 signaling, while neuronal dbl-1 expression suffices to induce epidermal immune effectors in some contexts, highlighting model utility for neuro–epidermal communication (WormBook, Aug 2018, https://doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.83.2) (gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 3-5).
- Network dissection of immunity pathways: Transcriptomics and genetics downstream of DBL-1 identify innate immune effectors and secondary pathways (e.g., hedgehog-like) that are used to define cross-tissue responses during infection (BMC Dev Biol, Jun 2010, https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-213x-10-61; PLOS Genetics, Jun 2024, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011324) (roberts2010regulationofgenes pages 1-2, degroot2023smoc1interactswith pages 1-2).

4) Expert opinions and analyses from authoritative sources
- WormBook and comprehensive reviews position DBL-1 as a canonical BMP ligand in C. elegans with secretion from neurons and principal hypodermal action, detailing receptors, Smads, and nuclear partners such as SMA-9/Schnurri for cell- and stage-specific outputs (WormBook TGF-β chapter, Jul 2013, https://doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.22.2; Frontiers 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2023.1220068) (gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 3-5, gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 8-10, gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 7-8, yamamoto2023tgfβpathwaysin pages 3-4).
- Mechanistic extracellular regulation is refined by biophysical and genetic analyses showing positive LRIG/SMA-10 acting between ligand and receptors, and the dual-modulator SMOC-1 engaging both LON-2 and the DBL-1 mature domain, a conceptually important advance for BMP gradient control in vivo (PLoS Genetics, May 2010, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000963; PLOS Biology, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002272) (gumienny2010caenorhabditiseleganssma10lrig pages 1-2, degroot2023smoc1interactswith pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent and foundational studies
- Body size dose–response and ECM phenotypes: Quantified body length changes—dbl-1 loss-of-function ~79% of wild type, dbl-1 overexpression ~110%, lon-2(e678) ~119%—demonstrate dose-sensitive regulation of size; P < 0.0001 for comparisons. DBL-1 dosage perturbs cuticle ultrastructure and surface lipids, correlating with dye permeability and aggregation phenotypes (PLoS ONE, Jul 2014, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101929) (schultz2014regulationofextracellular pages 1-2).
- Transcriptomic regulation: Microarray/qPCR comparing sma-6(wk7) versus dbl-1 overexpression revealed positive regulation of structural genes (collagens/ECM), proteostasis and metabolism genes, and up-regulation of innate immune genes; evidence supported a hedgehog-related module downstream of hypodermal DBL-1 (BMC Dev Biol, Jun 2010, https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-213x-10-61) (roberts2010regulationofgenes pages 1-2).
- Immune pathway genetics: Canonical DBL-1/BMP receptors and Smads are required for survival on bacterial pathogens; BMP ligand pairs act nonredundantly, with potential TIG-2/TIG-3 heterodimers mediating aspects of the response (PLOS Genetics, Jun 2024, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011324) (degroot2023smoc1interactswith pages 1-2).

Functional annotation: mechanism, site of action, and pathway integration
- Primary role and mechanism in body size and ECM: DBL-1 signaling in the hypodermis regulates body size not by driving cell division, but by controlling ECM/cuticle organization and collagen gene expression and secretion, alongside metabolic programs. Ultrastructure and permeability assays substantiate DBL-1’s role in barrier integrity and cuticle lipid organization (PLoS ONE 2014; BMC Dev Biol 2010) (schultz2014regulationofextracellular pages 1-2, roberts2010regulationofgenes pages 1-2).
- Cellular/extracellular localization: DBL-1 is a secreted dimeric cystine-knot cytokine produced by neurons; receptors/Snads act in target tissues, prominently hypodermis, with nuclear accumulation of SMA-2/3/4 complexes to regulate transcription. SMA-9/Schnurri partners confer target specificity. This architecture places the functional site largely at the hypodermal plasma membrane and nuclei of receiving cells (WormBook 2013; Frontiers 2023) (gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 3-5, gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 8-10, gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 7-8, yamamoto2023tgfβpathwaysin pages 3-4).
- Extracellular modulators: LON-2/glypican sequesters/negatively regulates DBL-1 in the ECM; SMA-10/LRIG binds SMA-6/DAF-4 to enhance signaling at the hypodermal surface; SMOC-1 binds both LON-2 and DBL-1 to exert context-dependent inhibition or promotion. Together, these factors tune ligand availability and receptor competence in vivo (PLoS Genetics 2010; PLOS Biology 2023; WormBook 2013) (gumienny2010caenorhabditiseleganssma10lrig pages 1-2, degroot2023smoc1interactswith pages 1-2, gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 3-5, gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 8-10).
- Innate immunity: DBL-1 signaling induces innate immune effectors and supports survival upon bacterial challenge; neuronal secretion can drive epidermal AMP induction, illustrating neuro–epidermal communication. Recent work shows BMP ligands contribute broadly to pathogen survival, with canonical DBL-1 components required (WormBook innate immunity 2018, https://doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.83.2; BMC Dev Biol 2010; PLOS Genetics 2024) (gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 3-5, roberts2010regulationofgenes pages 1-2, degroot2023smoc1interactswith pages 1-2).
- Metabolic crosstalk (insulin/IGF): Reviews synthesize interactions between DBL-1 signaling and metabolism, including lipid homeostasis via interplay with insulin-like signaling, although detailed 2021–2018 mechanistic studies lie outside the current evidence set; nonetheless, DBL-1’s action in intestine and hypodermis and transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes provide a mechanistic basis (Frontiers 2023; BMC Dev Biol 2010) (yamamoto2023tgfβpathwaysin pages 3-4, roberts2010regulationofgenes pages 1-2).

Conclusions and outlook
DBL-1 (UniProt G5EEL5) is the canonical BMP-like ligand in C. elegans that is secreted by neurons and acts primarily on hypodermal targets to regulate cuticle/ECM organization and body size through SMA-6/DAF-4 receptors and SMA-2/3/4 Smads, with SMA-9/Schnurri providing transcriptional specificity. Recent advances illuminate a sophisticated extracellular control layer: SMA-10/LRIG that promotes receptor competence and SMOC-1 that scaffolds LON-2 glypican and DBL-1 to tune signaling directionally. Contemporary studies also highlight complex ligand–ligand interactions in immunity, with canonical DBL-1 components required for pathogen responses. Quantitative data demonstrate dose-sensitive control of body length and barrier/ECM phenotypes, and transcriptomics tie DBL-1 to collagen/ECM and immune effector programs. Together, these findings solidify DBL-1 as a tractable model for conserved BMP signaling, ECM biology, and neuro–epidermal communication relevant to development, immunity, and metabolism (https://doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.22.2; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2023.1220068; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000963; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002272; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101929; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-213x-10-61; https://doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.83.2) (gumienny2013tgfβsignalingin pages 3-5, yamamoto2023tgfβpathwaysin pages 3-4, gumienny2010caenorhabditiseleganssma10lrig pages 1-2, degroot2023smoc1interactswith pages 1-2, schultz2014regulationofextracellular pages 1-2, roberts2010regulationofgenes pages 1-2).
