description: 'SKN-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian Nrf1/Nrf2 (CNC/bZIP) transcription
  factors, functioning as the master regulator of oxidative stress responses and xenobiotic
  detoxification. SKN-1 has three major isoforms with distinct functions: SKN-1A is
  ER-associated and mediates proteasome stress responses; SKN-1B localizes to ASI
  chemosensory neurons and mediates dietary restriction effects on longevity; SKN-1C
  is the primary intestinal isoform regulating Phase II detoxification genes. SKN-1
  binds DNA as a monomer using a unique mechanism combining a bZIP-like basic region
  with an N-terminal arm for minor groove contacts. Key target genes include glutathione
  S-transferases (gst-4, gst-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase (gcs-1), and proteasome
  subunits. SKN-1 is regulated by p38/PMK-1 phosphorylation (activation), WDR-23/CUL4/DDB1
  ubiquitin ligase complex (degradation), and insulin/IGF-1 signaling via AKT kinases
  (inhibition). Beyond stress responses, SKN-1 plays an essential developmental role
  in mesendoderm specification during embryogenesis, specifying the fate of ventral
  blastomeres that give rise to the pharynx and intestine.'
