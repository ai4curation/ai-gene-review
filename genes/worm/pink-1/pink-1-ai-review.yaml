description: PINK-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase
  1), a mitochondrial serine/threonine kinase that functions as a key sensor of mitochondrial
  damage and initiator of mitophagy. The protein contains an N-terminal mitochondrial
  targeting sequence (residues 1-74), a transmembrane domain, and a cytosol-facing
  protein kinase catalytic domain (residues 137-483). Under normal conditions with
  healthy mitochondria, PINK-1 is imported into mitochondria and cleaved by proteases.
  Upon mitochondrial depolarization or damage, full-length PINK-1 accumulates on the
  outer mitochondrial membrane where it autophosphorylates and becomes active. Activated
  PINK-1 phosphorylates ubiquitin at Ser65 and also phosphorylates PDR-1 (the C. elegans
  Parkin homolog) at Ser65, promoting PDR-1 activation and recruitment. This initiates
  a feed-forward ubiquitination cascade that labels damaged mitochondria for autophagic
  clearance (mitophagy). In C. elegans, PINK-1 is required for mitophagy, mitochondrial
  quality control during aging, and stress responses including oxidative stress. pink-1
  mutants show reduced mitochondrial cristae length, increased paraquat sensitivity,
  and defects in axon guidance. PINK-1 acts antagonistically to LRK-1 (LRRK2 homolog)
  in stress response and neurite outgrowth.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from orthologs. This annotation
      accurately reflects the core function of PINK-1 in initiating mitophagy. The
      PINK-1/PDR-1 pathway is the canonical mitophagy pathway in C. elegans, and multiple
      studies demonstrate PINK-1's essential role in this process [PMID:25896323,
      file:worm/pink-1/pink-1-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PINK-1 is a central regulator of mitophagy. Upon mitochondrial depolarization,
      PINK-1 stabilizes on the outer mitochondrial membrane where it phosphorylates
      ubiquitin and PDR-1/Parkin to initiate the mitophagic cascade. This is well-established
      across species and supported by direct experimental evidence in C. elegans.
      The IBA annotation is phylogenetically sound and consistent with experimental
      data.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for the core molecular function of PINK-1 as a serine/threonine
      kinase. PINK-1 contains a conserved protein kinase domain (residues 137-483)
      and is classified in the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. The kinase catalyzes
      phosphorylation of serine residues on ubiquitin (Ser65) and Parkin/PDR-1 (Ser65
      in the Ubl domain).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the fundamental molecular function of PINK-1. The protein contains
      a conserved kinase domain with canonical N- and C-lobes and PINK1-specific insert
      regions. UniProt records the catalytic activity (EC 2.7.11.1) and the active
      site at position 338. The annotation is appropriately specific and reflects
      the core enzymatic activity.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation suggesting PINK-1 involvement in regulation of apoptosis.
      While mammalian PINK1 has been implicated in apoptosis regulation, direct experimental
      evidence for this role in C. elegans is limited. The primary role of PINK-1
      in worms appears to be in mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control rather
      than direct apoptosis regulation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: PINK1 involvement in apoptosis regulation is primarily characterized in
      mammalian systems. While mitochondrial dysfunction (which PINK-1 regulates)
      can influence apoptotic pathways, direct evidence for PINK-1 regulation of apoptosis
      in C. elegans is not well established. The annotation may be valid based on
      phylogenetic inference but represents a secondary rather than core function
      in worms.
