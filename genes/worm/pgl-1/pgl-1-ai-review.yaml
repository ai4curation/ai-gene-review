description: 'PGL-1 is a constitutive P granule scaffold protein present throughout all developmental stages with guanyl-specific endoribonuclease activity (EC 4.6.1.24). It contains RGG repeats for RNA binding and self-association domains that enable homodimerization and P granule assembly. Essential for fertility in C. elegans, PGL-1 is required for germ cell proliferation, gamete generation (both oogenesis and spermatogenesis), and protection from excessive apoptosis. The protein cleaves single-stranded RNA specifically after guanosine residues, generating 2,3-cyclic phosphate intermediates. It localizes exclusively to cytoplasmic P granules in germ cells throughout development and exhibits temperature-sensitive phenotypes, with redundancy provided by paralog PGL-3 but not PGL-2.'

  review:
    summary: 'This IBA annotation is incorrect for PGL-1. PGL-1 is not a helicase but rather a guanyl-specific endoribonuclease and P granule scaffold protein. The deep research clearly states PGL-1 has ribonuclease activity, not helicase activity. UniProt confirms PGL-1 is a guanyl-specific ribonuclease (EC 4.6.1.24).'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'PGL-1 lacks helicase domains and has no demonstrated helicase activity. The protein functions as an endoribonuclease that cleaves RNA after guanosine residues, not as a helicase that unwinds RNA. This appears to be a misannotation through phylogenetic inference.'
