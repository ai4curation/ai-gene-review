description: PGL-1 is a constitutive P granule scaffold protein present throughout
  all developmental stages with guanyl-specific endoribonuclease activity (EC 4.6.1.24).
  It contains RGG repeats for RNA binding and self-association domains that enable
  homodimerization and P granule assembly. Essential for fertility in C. elegans,
  PGL-1 is required for germ cell proliferation, gamete generation (both oogenesis
  and spermatogenesis), and protection from excessive apoptosis. The protein cleaves
  single-stranded RNA specifically after guanosine residues, generating 2,3-cyclic
  phosphate intermediates. It localizes exclusively to cytoplasmic P granules in germ
  cells throughout development and exhibits temperature-sensitive phenotypes, with
  redundancy provided by paralog PGL-3 but not PGL-2.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This IBA annotation is incorrect for PGL-1. PGL-1 is not a helicase but
      rather a guanyl-specific endoribonuclease and P granule scaffold protein. The
      deep research clearly states PGL-1 has ribonuclease activity, not helicase activity.
      UniProt confirms PGL-1 is a guanyl-specific ribonuclease (EC 4.6.1.24).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: PGL-1 lacks helicase domains and has no demonstrated helicase activity.
      The protein functions as an endoribonuclease that cleaves RNA after guanosine
      residues, not as a helicase that unwinds RNA. This appears to be a misannotation
      through phylogenetic inference.

    label: mRNA binding
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: While PGL-1 does bind RNA through its RGG repeats, the evidence suggests
      it binds RNA generally rather than specifically mRNA. The protein recruits various
      RNA-binding proteins and RNAs into P granules but mRNA-specific binding has
      not been demonstrated directly.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: PGL-1 contains RGG repeats that mediate RNA binding, but there is no specific
      evidence for mRNA selectivity over other RNA types. The broader term RNA binding
      (GO:0003723) is more appropriate and is already annotated.

    summary: No evidence supports PGL-1 involvement in splicing. PGL-1 is a P granule
      component that functions in the cytoplasm, not in nuclear splicing. Its known
      functions are P granule assembly, RNA cleavage, and germ cell development.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: PGL-1 localizes to cytoplasmic P granules, not to nuclear speckles where
      splicing occurs. There is no experimental evidence linking PGL-1 to spliceosome
      function or mRNA splicing. This appears to be an incorrect phylogenetic inference.

  review:
    summary: PGL-1 is not involved in mRNA export. It is a cytoplasmic P granule protein
      that functions outside the nucleus. While P granules are perinuclear, they are
      on the cytoplasmic side and PGL-1 has no demonstrated role in nuclear-cytoplasmic
      transport.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: PGL-1 is exclusively cytoplasmic and functions in P granule assembly in

      cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PGL-1 functions as a lyase when it cleaves RNA, producing 2,3-cyclic phosphate

    summary: Excellent annotation for a core function. PGL-1 is essential for P granule
      assembly and organization, acting as a scaffold protein that nucleates granule
      formation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PGL-1 is a fundamental P granule scaffold protein. Loss of PGL-1 results
      in defective or absent P granules. The protein self-associates and recruits
      other components to form organized P granules. This is a defining biological
      function.
