description: Lysozyme-like protein 7 (LYS-7) is a protist-type (Entamoeba-type) 
  lysozyme that functions as a key antimicrobial effector in C. elegans innate 
  immunity. Despite belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase family 25 and containing
  a Ch-type lysozyme domain, the protein lacks conserved catalytic residues and 
  may not have enzymatic activity. LYS-7 is expressed in the intestine, rectal 
  gland cells, and head neurons, and is strongly induced by various bacterial 
  pathogens including S. marcescens, M. nematophilum, and S. typhimurium. 
  Functional studies demonstrate that LYS-7 provides resistance against the 
  Gram-positive bacterium B. thuringiensis and M. nematophilum, and the fungal 
  pathogen C. neoformans. Intriguingly, lys-7 knockout animals show increased 
  tolerance to S. typhimurium infection, revealing a complex immunological 
  trade-off. LYS-7 expression is regulated by the p38 MAPK pathway and the 
  DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin-like signaling pathway, with P. aeruginosa actively 
  suppressing lys-7 expression as a virulence strategy.

    review:
      summary: This annotation from phylogenetic analysis (PANTHER) is 
        questionable for lys-7. LYS-7 is a lysozyme-like protein that functions 
        as an antimicrobial effector molecule. While lys-7 expression is 
        regulated by signal transduction pathways (p38 MAPK, DAF-2/DAF-16 
        insulin signaling), the protein itself is not directly involved in 
        signal transduction. LYS-7 is a downstream effector of these signaling 
        pathways, not a component of the signaling cascade.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: LYS-7 is an antimicrobial effector molecule whose expression is 
        regulated by signaling pathways, but it does not itself participate in 
        signal transduction. The annotation likely results from phylogenetic 
        inference that does not distinguish between regulators and effectors of 
        signaling pathways.

    review:
      summary: Proposed new annotation based on structural inference. LYS-7 
        contains a Ch-type lysozyme domain (amino acids 53-273) which is a 
        carbohydrate-binding domain. While catalytic activity may be absent due 
        to missing active site residues, the domain structure suggests retention
        of carbohydrate binding capability. This may explain the antimicrobial 
        function through non-enzymatic binding to bacterial or fungal cell wall 
        components.
      action: NEW
      reason: LYS-7 has a Ch-type lysozyme domain that typically binds 
        carbohydrates. Even without catalytic activity, binding to peptidoglycan
        or chitin components could provide antimicrobial function. This 
        annotation captures the likely molecular function when enzymatic 
        activity is uncertain.

core_functions:
  - description: LYS-7 functions as an antimicrobial effector in innate 
      immunity. Knockout mutants show increased susceptibility to B. 
      thuringiensis (PMID:21931778), M. nematophilum (PMID:16809667), and C. 
      neoformans (PMID:21399680). Overexpression increases resistance to 
      pathogens (PMID:21931778). Despite having a lysozyme domain, LYS-7 lacks 
      conserved catalytic residues, suggesting it may function through 
      carbohydrate binding rather than enzymatic activity.
