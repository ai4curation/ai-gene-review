## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O16202
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Lysozyme-like protein 7 {ECO:0000305}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=lys-7 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:C02A12.4}; ORFNames=C02A12.4 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:C02A12.4};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 25 family.
- **Key Domains:** GH25_Enzymes. (IPR051595); Glyco_hydro_25. (IPR002053); Glycoside_hydrolase_SF. (IPR017853)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "lys-7" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'lys-7' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **lys-7** (gene ID: lys-7, UniProt: O16202) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional annotation of C. elegans lys-7 (UniProt O16202): a GH25/protist-type lysozyme in epithelial innate immunity

Verification of identity and domains
The target corresponds to lys-7 (gene: C02A12.4) from Caenorhabditis elegans, encoding a lysozyme-like secreted precursor that belongs to the protist/Entamoeba-type lysozyme family within glycosyl hydrolase family 25 (GH25; Chalaropsis-type fold). Early infection-transcriptomics in C. elegans identified lys-7 (clone yk361g12) as an intestine-expressed, infection-inducible lysozyme, consistent with UniProt O16202 annotations and the GH25/protist-type assignment (Mallo et al., Current Biology, 2002; published Jul 22, 2002; https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(02)00928-4) (mallo2002inducibleantibacterialdefense pages 2-3). A systematic analysis of protist-type lysozymes confirmed lys-7 as a member of the C. elegans lysozyme repertoire contributing to pathogen resistance (Boehnisch et al., PLoS ONE, Sep 7, 2011; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024619) (boehnisch2011protisttypelysozymesof pages 1-2).

Catalytic function, substrates, and atypical features
Lysozymes hydrolyze β-1,4 linkages in peptidoglycan (PG), classically acting as muramidases. Homology modeling places LYS-7 in the Chalaropsis/GH25 transglycosidase superfamily with predicted 1,4-β-N-acetylmuraminidase activity and a Ch-type α/β fold. Notably, LYS-7 appears to lack the canonical DXE motif used by GH25 lysozymes for the two-step hydrolysis, implying an atypical catalytic mechanism; one conserved Asp (D59) may support a single-step reaction or act on cyclic PG fragments such as tracheal cytotoxin (TCT). Functionally, LYS-7 activity against Salmonella is inferred to be bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal, potentially modulating bacterial stress regulons (PhoP/Q, RpoS) rather than reducing burden (Marsh, thesis/monograph, 2010; sections on GH25 modeling and tolerance; context URL not available) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsin pages 147-151, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 147-151, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 101-108, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsin pages 101-108, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 130-134). These data support GH25 membership and suggest nuanced substrate handling distinct from canonical DXE-dependent lysozymes.

Expression pattern and subcellular localization
Expression is prominent in the intestinal epithelium and the pharyngeal/valve region, and lys-7 is secretion-competent (precursor with signal peptide). Mallo et al. mapped lys-7 expression to intestine and intestinal valve/terminal bulb and showed robust induction during bacterial infection (Serratia marcescens), with Northern and array measurements rising markedly by 48 h post-exposure (Current Biology, 2002; https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(02)00928-4) (mallo2002inducibleantibacterialdefense pages 2-3). Broad profiling indicates digestive tract expression (intestine and/or pharynx) for lysozymes including lys-7 (Alper et al., MCB, Aug 2007; https://doi.org/10.1128/MCB.02070-06) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 130-134). Proteomics during infection also detected induction of lysozymes and showed that RNAi knockdown of lys-7 increased susceptibility, consistent with secreted effector function in the intestine (Simonsen et al., Virulence, Mar 2011; https://doi.org/10.4161/viru.2.2.15270) ( in tool context; see summary) (boehnisch2011protisttypelysozymesof pages 1-2).

Regulation and signaling pathways
Transcriptional induction of lys-7 integrates conserved epithelial immune signaling:
- p38 MAPK pathway (TIR-1 → NSY-1 → SEK-1 → PMK-1) and ATF-7: Small-molecule immune stimulation upregulates lys-7 via a pathway partially dependent on PMK-1 and ATF-7 (Pukkila-Worley et al., PLoS Genetics, Jun 2012; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002733) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 130-134). Multiple infection and probiotic studies show lys-7 induction requires functional NSY-1/SEK-1/PMK-1 signaling (e.g., ETEC/Salmonella models) (Zhou et al., Frontiers in Immunology, Sep 2018; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01745) and (Zhou et al., Frontiers in Immunology, Mar 2021; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.653205) (sun2015intracellularinfectiologycell pages 3-4, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 147-151).
- Insulin/IGF-1-DAF-16: DAF-16 influences lys-7 expression; long-lived daf-2 mutants upregulate lys-7, and genetic interactions (lys-7;daf-16 double mutants) abolish Salmonella tolerance phenotypes (Marsh, 2010) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 101-108, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsin pages 101-108, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsin pages 147-151, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 147-151).

Roles in immunity and pathogen-specific phenotypes
- Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium: Paradoxically, lys-7 deletion enhances survival without lowering pathogen load (tolerance). The effect depends on bacterial stress regulators (RpoS) and host pathways (DAF-16), consistent with a bacteriostatic/immune-modulatory role (Marsh, 2010) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 101-108, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsin pages 101-108, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsin pages 147-151, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 147-151).
- Cryptococcus neoformans (fungus): lys-7 mutants are hypersusceptible (reduced survival), indicating antifungal protective function, possibly via chitin-related activity (Marsh, 2010) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 101-108, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsin pages 101-108).
- Bacillus thuringiensis: lys-7 knockout decreases resistance; overexpression increases resistance, demonstrating a direct contribution to defense against Gram-positive Bt (Boehnisch et al., PLoS ONE, 2011; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024619) (boehnisch2011protisttypelysozymesof pages 1-2).
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa and pathogenic E. coli: lys-7 is part of the inducible antibacterial effector repertoire; immune-stimulatory compound RPW-24 induces lys-7 expression and protects against P. aeruginosa via PMK-1/ATF-7 (Pukkila-Worley et al., 2012; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002733) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 130-134). Reviews and genetic studies have implicated lys-7 in responses to P. aeruginosa and E. coli LF82 (Boehnisch et al., 2011) (boehnisch2011protisttypelysozymesof pages 1-2).
- Klebsiella pneumoniae: Infection models modulating immune and barrier function track lys-7 among effectors; lys-7 is included in panels altered by Klebsiella infection (Yang et al., Current Research in Microbial Sciences, Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmicr.2023.100181) (context tool summary) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 101-108).

Recent developments (2023–2024) and quantitative data
- Microbiota/diet modulation: A glucose-altered microbiota suppressed lys-7 expression by RT-qPCR (n ≈ 400/group; significant by unpaired t-test), while increasing pathogen susceptibility and epithelial dysfunction (Kingsley et al., Scientific Reports, Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-63514-w) (kingsley2024glucosefedmicrobiotaalters pages 6-7).
- Probiotic immunity: Feeding the probiotic Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus IDCC 3201 induced >2-fold upregulation of innate immune genes, including lysozymes such as lys-7, and enhanced longevity and resistance to pathogens (Lee et al., Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2402.02025) (lee2024metabolicregulationof pages 6-8). Earlier studies showed that protective microbes (e.g., Enterococcus faecalis) can exploit lys-7-mediated immunity; lys-7 knockout alters protective microbe–pathogen competition (Ford et al., Heredity, Nov 2022; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41437-022-00569-3) (context summary) (kingsley2024glucosefedmicrobiotaalters pages 6-7).
- Stress crosstalk: HSF-1 deficiency induced innate immunity genes including lys-7 in young adults, consistent with compensatory activation of immunity and UPR pathways (Kovács et al., Aging Cell, Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.14246) (kingsley2024glucosefedmicrobiotaalters pages 6-7).

Applications and real-world implementations
- Reporters: lys-7::GFP transgenics are widely used to visualize immune activation in vivo and to screen immunomodulatory small molecules and microbial metabolites; induction by protective Streptomyces extracts or RPW-24 has been demonstrated in infection rescue assays (Fatin et al., Frontiers in Microbiology, Nov 2017; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02267; Pukkila-Worley et al., 2012; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002733) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 130-134).
- Probiotics/biocontrol: Lactobacillus/Lacticaseibacillus strains upregulate lys-7 and require p38 MAPK and DAF-16 pathways for protection against enteric pathogens, supporting host-directed anti-infective strategies (Zhou et al., 2018 and 2021 Frontiers in Immunology; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01745; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.653205) (sun2015intracellularinfectiologycell pages 3-4, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 147-151). 2024 probiotic study independently confirms lys-7 upregulation (Lee et al., 2024) (lee2024metabolicregulationof pages 6-8).

Expert opinions and synthesis
Authoritative reviews emphasize that C. elegans lysozymes, including protist-type members such as lys-7, are core epithelial effectors under p38 MAPK control, with pathogen- and context-specific roles that can extend beyond direct bacteriolysis to tolerance and immunomodulation (Dierking et al., Philos Trans R Soc B, May 2016; https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2015.0299; Alper et al., MCB, 2007; https://doi.org/10.1128/MCB.02070-06) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 130-134, boehnisch2011protisttypelysozymesof pages 1-2). The Salmonella-tolerance tradeoff and the missing DXE motif in LYS-7 suggest a non-canonical enzymology and/or targets (e.g., cyclic PG fragments), aligning with expert views that C. elegans antimicrobials can shape pathogen physiology rather than simply kill (Marsh, 2010) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsin pages 147-151, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 147-151, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 101-108).

Key statistics and data points
- Infection induction: lys-7 expression rises substantially by 48 h after Serratia exposure (array/northern increases in Mallo et al., 2002) (mallo2002inducibleantibacterialdefense pages 2-3).
- Bt defense: lys-7 overexpression increases, and knockout decreases survival to pathogenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Boehnisch et al., 2011) (boehnisch2011protisttypelysozymesof pages 1-2).
- Salmonella tolerance: loss of lys-7 more than doubles median survival during S. Typhimurium infection without consistent pathogen load reduction (Marsh, 2010) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 101-108, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsin pages 101-108).
- 2024 microbiota: lys-7 significantly downregulated under glucose-fed microbiota (n ≈ 400 per group, p < 0.05) (Kingsley et al., 2024) (kingsley2024glucosefedmicrobiotaalters pages 6-7).
- 2024 probiotic: >2-fold upregulation of lysozyme genes including lys-7 by L. rhamnosus IDCC 3201 with improved pathogen resistance and longevity (Lee et al., 2024) (lee2024metabolicregulationof pages 6-8).

Conclusions (with verification notes)
- Identity and organism: lys-7 in C. elegans encodes a secreted protist-type GH25 lysozyme-like protein consistent with UniProt O16202, with expression in intestine/pharynx and robust infection inducibility (Mallo 2002; Boehnisch 2011) (mallo2002inducibleantibacterialdefense pages 2-3, boehnisch2011protisttypelysozymesof pages 1-2).
- Function: Predicted muramidase activity with atypical catalytic motif; evidence supports roles in epithelial defense, including antifungal action and complex bacteriostatic effects shaping pathogen tolerance (Marsh 2010) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsin pages 147-151, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 147-151, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 101-108, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsin pages 101-108).
- Regulation: Controlled by p38 MAPK (NSY-1/SEK-1/PMK-1) and ATF-7, and influenced by insulin/IGF-1-DAF-16 signaling; induced by infections and host-directed small molecules/probiotics (Pukkila-Worley 2012; Zhou 2018/2021) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 130-134, sun2015intracellularinfectiologycell pages 3-4).
- Recent advances: 2024 studies link diet-altered microbiota to lys-7 suppression and probiotics to lys-7 upregulation with improved host outcomes, underscoring lys-7 as a sensitive readout and effector of epithelial immunity (Kingsley 2024; Lee 2024) (kingsley2024glucosefedmicrobiotaalters pages 6-7, lee2024metabolicregulationof pages 6-8).

Limitations and open questions
Direct biochemical demonstration of LYS-7 catalytic activity and substrate specificity in vitro remains limited in the literature; structural and enzymatic validation of the proposed atypical mechanism (lack of DXE) would refine functional inference (Marsh, 2010) (marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsin pages 147-151, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 147-151, marsh2010hostpathogeninteractionsina pages 130-134). Furthermore, while lys-7 reporters and transcript assays are widely used, disentangling direct antimicrobial versus immunomodulatory roles requires additional mechanistic dissection.
