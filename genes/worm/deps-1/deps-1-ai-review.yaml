description: 'DEPS-1 (DEfective P granules and Sterile) is a scaffold protein essential
  for P granule assembly and integrity in C. elegans germ cells. It functions as a
  key component of the P-granule assembly pathway, required for proper localization
  of PGL-1 and accumulation of GLH-1. DEPS-1 is also essential for RNA interference
  (RNAi) in the germline, particularly for piRNA-mediated gene silencing, where it
  directly interacts with the Argonaute protein PRG-1 and promotes formation of secondary
  22G-RNAs (endo-siRNAs). The protein plays roles in germ cell proliferation, fertility,
  and small RNA-directed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.

    review:
      summary: 'DEPS-1 is involved in multiple ncRNA-mediated gene silencing pathways.
        It is required for RNAi of germline-expressed genes and specifically for piRNA
        gene silencing (PMID:18234720, PMID:32843637). DEPS-1 promotes accumulation
        of RDE-4 (a dsRNA-binding protein required for RNAi) and positively regulates
        formation of secondary 22G-RNAs, which are endo-siRNAs.

        '
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: 'This annotation correctly captures a core function of DEPS-1. The gene
        is required for RNA interference in the germline, promoting accumulation of
        RDE-4 and regulating endo-siRNA production (PMID:18234720). Additionally,
        DEPS-1 is essential for piRNA-mediated silencing through its interaction with
        PRG-1 (PMID:32843637). While GO:0031047 is a broad term, it accurately encompasses
        DEPS-1''s role in both RNAi and piRNA pathways.

      summary: 'DEPS-1 localizes to the perinuclear region of cytoplasm where P granules
        are found. It co-localizes with PRG-1 at peri-nuclear P-granules in the proliferative

        provides more specific localization information. This IEA annotation can be
