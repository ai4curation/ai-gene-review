description: 'OCR-2 (OSM-9 and Capsaicin Receptor-related 2) is a TRPV (Transient
  Receptor Potential Vanilloid) family cation channel subunit that functions as part
  of a heteromeric complex with OSM-9 in C. elegans sensory neurons. The OCR-2/OSM-9
  heteromeric channel is essential for multiple sensory modalities including thermosensation,
  chemosensation, osmosensation, and nociception. The channel localizes to the sensory
  cilia of amphid neurons (including ADL, ASH, AWA, ADF) where it mediates sensory
  transduction. OCR-2/OSM-9 is directly activated by warming stimuli and functions
  as an accessorial warm receptor contributing to temperature acclimatization. The
  channel also regulates serotonin biosynthesis in ADF neurons. Neither OCR-2 nor
  OSM-9 alone is sufficient for heat-evoked currents; functional channels require
  co-expression of both subunits. The channel displays outward-rectifying current-voltage
  characteristics typical of TRPV channels.

    supporting_text: OSM-9 and OCR-2 cooperatively responded to warming; however,
      neither TRPV subunit alone was responsive to warming
- description: 'Core molecular function as a calcium-permeable channel. As a TRPV
    family channel, OCR-2/OSM-9 conducts calcium and other cations. The channel activity
    underlies sensory transduction across multiple modalities including chemosensation.

      transduction, including olfaction, osmosensation, mechanosensation, and chemosensation

    supporting_text: OCR-2 (OSM-9 and capsaicin receptor-related) is a TRPV (vanilloid
      subfamily of transient receptor potential channel) protein that regulates serotonin
      (5-HT) biosynthesis in chemosensory neurons

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the precise ionic selectivity of the OCR-2/OSM-9 heteromeric channel?
- question: How does OCR-2 contribute to the non-cell autonomous UPR signaling in
    sensory neurons?
- question: What is the stoichiometry of the OCR-2/OSM-9 heteromeric channel?
- question: Are there other OCR family members that can substitute for OCR-2 in different
    neurons?
- question: How does the N-terminal domain of OCR-2 specifically regulate osmosensation
    vs olfaction?
