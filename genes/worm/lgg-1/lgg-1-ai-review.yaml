description: 'LGG-1 is the C. elegans GABARAP/ATG8 family ortholog and a central ubiquitin-like
  modifier in macroautophagy. The protein is proteolytically cleaved at Gly-116 by
  ATG-4.1/ATG-4.2, then conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) via the ATG7-ATG3-ATG12/5/16
  conjugation system, anchoring it to autophagosomal membranes. LGG-1 functions primarily
  in autophagosome biogenesis and acts upstream of LGG-2 (the LC3-like paralog), recruiting
  LGG-2 to maturing autophagosomes. LGG-1 directly binds LIR motif-containing cargo
  receptors including SEPA-1 (for P granule degradation), SQST-1/p62, ALLO-1 (for
  paternal mitochondrial elimination), and the autophagy machinery components UNC-51,
  ATG-13, and EPG-7. GFP::LGG-1 puncta are the gold-standard autophagy reporter in
  C. elegans. LGG-1 is essential for dauer development, longevity, selective autophagy
  pathways (aggrephagy, mitophagy, xenophagy, allophagy), and stress resistance. Recent
  work (2023) shows that while C-terminal cleavage is essential for autophagosome
  initiation, PE lipidation is not strictly required for autophagy and development
  but enhances cargo recognition efficiency and LGG-2 autophagosome formation.
