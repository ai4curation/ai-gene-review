description: 'irg-1 (infection response gene 1) is a key marker gene of the C. elegans
  innate immune response that is strongly and specifically induced upon infection
  with virulent Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14. The gene is expressed in the intestine
  and is regulated by the bZIP transcription factor zip-2, which is activated in response
  to pathogen-induced translational inhibition (particularly via P. aeruginosa exotoxin
  A). irg-1 is induced independently of several classical immunity pathways including
  pmk-1/p38 MAPK, dbl-1/TGF-beta, kgb-1/JNK, and bar-1/beta-catenin. The protein contains
  a NADAR (NAD- and ADP-ribose-associated) domain, suggesting potential enzymatic
  activity related to ADP-ribose metabolism, though direct antimicrobial function
  has not been experimentally demonstrated. irg-1::GFP reporters are widely used as
  readouts for immune activation in C. elegans studies.
