description: 'ATFS-1 (Activating Transcription Factor associated with Stress-1) is
  a bZIP transcription factor that serves as the master regulator of the mitochondrial
  unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in C. elegans. The protein contains dual targeting
  signals: an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS, residues 1-23) and
  a nuclear localization signal (NLS, residues 436-441). Under normal conditions,
  ATFS-1 is efficiently imported into mitochondria and degraded by the Lon protease
  (LONP-1) in the matrix. During mitochondrial stress, when protein import efficiency
  is reduced, ATFS-1 accumulates in the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus where
  it activates transcription of UPRmt target genes including mitochondrial chaperones
  (hsp-6, hsp-60), proteases, import machinery components, innate immune effectors
  (abf-2, lys-2), and metabolic enzymes. This import-efficiency sensing mechanism
  allows cells to monitor mitochondrial health and mount protective responses. ATFS-1
  also regulates mitochondrial transcription by binding mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS gene
  promoters. The UPRmt provides protection against pathogen infection (particularly
  P. aeruginosa), anoxia-reperfusion injury, and oxidative stress. ATFS-1 activity
  is modulated by SUMOylation at K342, with desumoylation by ULP-4 enhancing transcriptional
  activity.'

  review:
    summary: ATFS-1 is a bZIP transcription factor that binds DNA to regulate transcription.
      The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from related ATF family
      members. ATFS-1 has been shown by ChIP-seq to bind directly to OXPHOS gene promoters
      in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (PMID:25773600).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The bZIP domain (residues 420-483) in ATFS-1 mediates sequence-specific
      DNA binding. ChIP-seq studies demonstrated direct binding to target gene promoters.
      This is a core molecular function annotation.
