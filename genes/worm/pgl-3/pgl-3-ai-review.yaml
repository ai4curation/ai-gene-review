description: PGL-3 is a constitutive P granule scaffold protein present throughout
  all developmental stages with guanyl-specific ribonuclease activity (EC 4.6.1.24)
  that functions redundantly with PGL-1. It cleaves single-stranded RNA specifically
  after guanosine residues, forms homodimers and heterodimers with other PGL proteins,
  and is essential for germline development when PGL-1 is absent. The protein contains
  an N-terminal dimerization domain critical for P granule assembly and a C-terminal
  RGG box for RNA binding. PGL-3 is exclusively localized to germline P granules where
  it protects germ cells from apoptosis, maintains germline identity, and can be regulated
  by autophagy through SEPA-1-mediated degradation.

  review:
    summary: RNA binding is supported by experimental evidence showing the RGG box
      domain binds RNA, though this IEA annotation is too generic compared to the
      specific ribonuclease function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PGL-3 does bind RNA through its C-terminal RGG box domain (confirmed experimentally).
      While generic, this is a core molecular function that enables both its ribonuclease
      activity and P granule assembly roles.

    reason: While technically correct as PGL-3 is indeed a nuclease, this annotation
