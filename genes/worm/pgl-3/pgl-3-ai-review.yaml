description: 'PGL-3 is a constitutive P granule scaffold protein present throughout all developmental stages with guanyl-specific ribonuclease activity (EC 4.6.1.24) that functions redundantly with PGL-1. It cleaves single-stranded RNA specifically after guanosine residues, forms homodimers and heterodimers with other PGL proteins, and is essential for germline development when PGL-1 is absent. The protein contains an N-terminal dimerization domain critical for P granule assembly and a C-terminal RGG box for RNA binding. PGL-3 is exclusively localized to germline P granules where it protects germ cells from apoptosis, maintains germline identity, and can be regulated by autophagy through SEPA-1-mediated degradation.'
