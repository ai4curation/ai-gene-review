P-granule component involved in germline development (PubMed:15238518, PubMed:19372764, PubMed:24746798). Together with the P-granule component pgl-1, is involved in the formation of P-granules (PubMed:21402787, PubMed:24746798, PubMed:27594427). Together with pgl- 1, probably recruits other granule components such as pos-1, mex-3 and glh-1, and RNA to P-granules (PubMed:21402787, PubMed:27594427). In vitro, binds mRNA; this interaction is required for the formation of liquid-like droplets that resemble P-granules (PubMed:27594427). Most likely recruits pgl-1 into P-granules during autophagy (PubMed:19167332). Associates with adapters such as sepa-1 and is required for the accumulation and degradation of P-granules by autophagy in somatic cells (PubMed:19167332, PubMed:24140420, PubMed:28806108). This ensures exclusive localization of the P-granules in germ cells (PubMed:19167332, PubMed:28806108). In addition, may act redundantly with pgl-1 to protect germ cells from excessive germline apoptosis during normal oogenesis and development of the two gonadal arms (PubMed:26598553). This may in part be through regulating the localization of sir-2.1 which is involved in germ cell apoptosis (PubMed:26598553). May protect somatic cells from excessive apoptosis during normal development (PubMed:27650246).\nSubcellular Location: Cytoplasmic granule\nSubunit: May form a homodimer (PubMed:21402787, PubMed:26787882). Interacts with pgl-1 and pgl-2; this association is not required for P- granule localization of either pgl-1 or pgl-2 (PubMed:15238518). Interacts with sepa-1; the interaction is enhanced in the presence of RNA (PubMed:19167332, PubMed:24140420). Interacts with prmt-1; the interaction is direct (PubMed:24140420).\n======================\n\nProvide a comprehensive report covering function, localization, processes, domains, disease associations, expression, conservation, and relevant GO terms.\n\nIMPORTANT: Focus specifically on the gene identified by the metadata above, particularly the UniProt ID, locus tag, and protein description if provided.\n\nSometimes different genes in the same organism have the same name.
