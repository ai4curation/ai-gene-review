description: UNC-1 is a stomatin-like protein belonging to the band 7/SPFH 
  domain family that functions as a critical positive regulator of gap junction 
  channels. It physically associates with UNC-9 innexin hemichannels at 
  intercellular junctions, maintaining them in an open state to enable 
  electrical coupling between neurons and muscle cells. This regulation is 
  essential for coordinated locomotion and neuronal communication in C. elegans.

      label: ion channel inhibitor activity
    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: This annotation is incorrect. UNC-1 functions as a positive 
        regulator of gap junction channels, maintaining them in an open state, 
        not as an inhibitor.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: UNC-1 positively regulates UNC-9 gap junction channels by 
        stabilizing them in an open conformation, enabling electrical coupling. 
        The experimental evidence demonstrates that loss of UNC-1 reduces 
        electrical coupling, indicating it promotes rather than inhibits channel
        activity. This IBA annotation appears to be a mis-inference.

    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: UNC-1 does localize to the plasma membrane as a multi-pass 
        membrane protein, but this is too broad given that the more specific 
        localization is to gap junctions.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While accurate, this annotation is overly general. UNC-1 
        specifically localizes to gap junctions at intercellular junctions, 
        which is a more informative and specific subcellular location. The 
        plasma membrane annotation should be retained as non-core context.

        overly general compared to gap junction localization.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: This IEA annotation correctly identifies membrane localization but
        lacks the specificity of experimental annotations showing gap junction 
        localization. Keep as non-core since gap junction is the functionally 
        relevant location.

      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Gap junction is the functionally relevant subcellular location 
        where UNC-1 carries out its primary role as a regulator of UNC-9 innexin
        channels. This annotation accurately reflects the core function and 
        localization of UNC-1.

      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: This IEA annotation based on InterPro domain prediction is 
        accurate but extremely general. UNC-1 is a multi-pass membrane protein, 
        but the more informative localizations are plasma membrane and gap 
        junction. Keep as non-core background annotation.

    review:
      summary: Computationally inferred annotation that UNC-1 localizes to 
        neuron projections. This is likely correct given UNC-1 functions 
        predominantly in neurons.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: UNC-1 is expressed in neurons and localizes to intercellular 
        junctions including at neuron projections where gap junctions form. This
        IEA annotation from ARBA machine learning is consistent with 
        experimental evidence showing neuronal expression.

      reason: While this IDA annotation is supported by immunohistochemistry 
        evidence, it is less specific than the gap junction annotation. 
        Cell-cell junction is a parent term of gap junction, so this provides 
        valid but less informative localization data. Keep as non-core context.
