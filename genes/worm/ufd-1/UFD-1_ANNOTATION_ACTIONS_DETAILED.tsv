8	GO:0005515	protein binding	IPI	PMID:11731503	MODIFY	Too generic; interaction with NPL-4.2 should be annotated as complex membership	NO	GO:0034098
9	GO:0005515	protein binding	IPI	PMID:14704431	MODIFY	Too generic; Y2H-based interaction should be annotated as complex membership	NO	GO:0034098
10	GO:0005515	protein binding	IPI	PMID:20977550	MODIFY	Too generic; CDC-48/UBXN-3 interactions should be annotated as complex membership	NO	GO:0034098
11	GO:0034098	VCP-NPL4-UFD1 AAA ATPase complex	IDA	PMID:20977550	ACCEPT	Direct experimental evidence from co-IP; demonstrates UFD-1/CDC-48/UBXN-3 complex formation	YES	N/A
12	GO:0044877	protein-containing complex binding	IDA	PMID:20977550	KEEP_AS_NON_CORE	Valid but overly general; redundant with GO:0034098 complex membership annotation	NO	N/A
