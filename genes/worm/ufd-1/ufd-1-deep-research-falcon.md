## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q19584
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Ubiquitin fusion degradation protein 1 homolog; Short=UB fusion protein 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ufd-1; ORFNames=F19B6.2;
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the UFD1 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Ufd1-like. (IPR004854); Ufd1-like_Nn. (IPR042299); UFD1_N1. (IPR055417); UFD1_N2. (IPR055418); UFD1_N1 (PF03152)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ufd-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ufd-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ufd-1** (gene ID: ufd-1, UniProt: Q19584) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status update
- Verified identity and context: ufd-1 (C. elegans, UniProt Q19584) encodes a UFD1-family protein that forms a constitutive heterodimer with NPL-4 and partners with the AAA+ ATPase CDC-48/p97. This identity and organismal context are consistent with worm primary literature cited below and align with the UFD1 family/domain assignment provided by UniProt (no conflicting “ufd-1” symbols were found in other worm contexts in the sources used) (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 2-4).

Research report: ufd-1 (C. elegans; UniProt Q19584)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Core role: UFD-1 is the canonical cofactor of the AAA+ ATPase CDC-48/p97, forming a 1:1 heterodimer with NPL-4 that docks on CDC-48 to recognize polyubiquitinated clients and drive their extraction/unfolding from membranes or macromolecular assemblies (“segregase” activity) (review/mechanistic overviews) (dressler2016theaaaatpasep97 pages 31-34, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19).
- Complex composition and recognition: UFD-1–NPL-4 binds the CDC-48 hexamer via bipartite interactions and provides the primary ubiquitin-binding interface, enabling recognition of K48/K63-linked chains and client processing; this is the dominant p97 adaptor module across pathways including ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and chromatin-associated degradation (CAD) (dressler2016theaaaatpasep97 pages 31-34, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19).
- Worm ortholog and naming: In C. elegans, ufd-1 (gene) encodes UFD-1 that functions with NPL-4 and CDC-48 in ERAD and DNA replication pathways, establishing conserved roles in metazoans (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 2-4).

2) Molecular function, complexes, pathways, and clients in C. elegans
- Validated molecular function: UFD-1 acts as a ubiquitin-selective cofactor of CDC-48 to extract ubiquitylated substrates; in worms, this is required for ERAD and for DNA replication-associated client turnover on chromatin (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 10-11, dressler2016theaaaatpasep97 pages 31-34).
- Principal complex partners: CDC-48 (p97/VCP ortholog) and NPL-4 (heterodimeric partner). UBXN-3/FAF1 functions as an accessory substrate selector for chromatin clients, recruiting CDC-48–UFD-1–NPL-4 to ubiquitylated replication factors (franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 10-11, franz2016ringofchange pages 4-5).
- ERAD pathway: CDC-48–UFD-1–NPL-4 mediates retrotranslocation/extraction of ubiquitylated ER proteins for proteasomal degradation; UFD-1/NPL-4 depletion in C. elegans disrupts ERAD (functional evidence and mechanistic reviews) (PNAS 2008, Jul 2008; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805944105) (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, dressler2016theaaaatpasep97 pages 31-34).
- DNA replication and chromatin-associated degradation (CAD): In early embryos, the CDC-48–UFD-1–NPL-4 complex is essential for efficient S-phase, preventing replication stress; on chromatin it promotes turnover of licensing factor CDT-1 and the removal/disassembly of CDC-45/GINS/CMG components, coordinated with UBXN-3/FAF1 (Nat Commun 2016, Feb 2016; https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10612) (franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 10-11, mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, franz2016ringofchange pages 4-5).
- Specific clients/steps supported in worm: CDT-1, CDC-45, and GINS are stabilized on chromatin upon perturbation of CDC-48–UFD-1–NPL-4 or UBXN-3; genetic and biochemical data indicate this axis targets licensing and replisome factors for extraction/turnover to safeguard fork progression (franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 10-11, franz2016ringofchange pages 4-5).

3) Cellular localization
- Endogenous localization: YFP-tagged UFD-1 and NPL-4 accumulate in nuclei after mitosis, and CDC-48 is required for their nuclear localization in embryos—consistent with roles in chromatin-associated client processing during S-phase (PNAS 2008, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805944105) (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2).

4) Phenotypes upon depletion or inhibition (worm)
- Embryogenesis and cell cycle: RNAi depletion of cdc-48, ufd-1, or npl-4 causes embryonic lethality, S-phase delay, replication checkpoint activation (RAD-51 foci), chromatin/segregation abnormalities (bridges), hydroxyurea hypersensitivity, and germline mitotic arrest with RAD-51-positive nuclei (PNAS 2008, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805944105) (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 2-4).
- Replication fork protection and CAD axis: Loss of UBXN-3/FAF1 stabilizes CDT-1 and CDC-45/GINS on chromatin, producing replication stress and genome instability in worms; these phenotypes reflect impaired CDC-48–UFD-1–NPL-4-dependent CAD at replication forks (Nat Commun 2016, Feb 2016; https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10612) (franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 10-11, franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 1-2).
- Innate immune state: Inhibition of UFD-1–NPL-4 triggers an aberrant immune-like transcriptional response mediated by ELT-2 and alters survival on Pseudomonas aeruginosa (preprint, initial posting Dec 12, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.12.571255) (rao2025inhibitionofthe pages 1-4).

5) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- UFD1–NPL4 as principal ubiquitin receptor for p97: Updated structural/mechanistic syntheses highlight UFD-1–NPL-4 as the primary ubiquitin-recognizing adaptor pair that recruits p97/CDC-48 to clients and explain how chain type/architecture influence engagement and unfolding; these reinforce the centrality of UFD-1–NPL-4 in both ERAD and chromatin functions (preprint, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202409.1194.v1) (mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19, dressler2016theaaaatpasep97 pages 31-34).
- Chromatin-associated client selection: Consolidation of the CAD concept in replication—where UBXN-3/FAF1 recruits CDC-48–UFD-1–NPL-4 to ubiquitylated replisome components—continues to be cited as a conserved metazoan mechanism ensuring timely replisome disassembly and fork progression (Nat Commun 2016, Feb 2016; https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10612) (franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 10-11, franz2016ringofchange pages 4-5).
- Immunity link in worms: Preprint evidence indicates that reducing UFD-1–NPL-4 function elicits an immune-like program in C. elegans with complex effects on pathogen survival dynamics, connecting proteostasis/ERAD and innate immunity (bioRxiv posting Dec 12, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.12.571255) (rao2025inhibitionofthe pages 1-4).

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Conceptual applications: The CDC-48/p97–UFD-1–NPL-4 axis is a widely leveraged model for studying ubiquitin-dependent extraction in ERAD and chromatin contexts. In worms, genetic and imaging assays (nuclear localization, chromatin fractionation, RAD-51 foci, HU sensitivity) provide functional readouts for client processing and replication stress that are used to dissect CAD mechanisms and cofactor dependencies (PNAS 2008; Nat Commun 2016) (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 10-11).
- Translational lens: While the sources here are mechanistic/organismal, they establish conserved principles (ubiquitin-directed segregase activity and client selection) that inform translational efforts targeting p97-cofactor axes in disease; in particular, the CAD paradigm and UFD-1–NPL-4’s receptor role are used to rationalize p97-directed therapeutic strategies in oncology and proteostasis disorders (mechanistic/review context) (mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19, dressler2016theaaaatpasep97 pages 31-34).

7) Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Reviews emphasize CDC-48/p97 as a chromatin segregase with UFD-1–NPL-4 as the major ubiquitin receptor, coordinating CAD of replication factors and safeguarding genome stability; UBXN-3/FAF1 provides substrate selection at forks (Front Genet 2016, May 2016; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2016.00073; mechanistic review 2016) (franz2016ringofchange pages 4-5, dressler2016theaaaatpasep97 pages 31-34).
- Mechanistic syntheses in 2024 underscore the central and conserved nature of UFD-1–NPL-4 in client recognition and p97 engagement across pathways, integrating structural and biochemical data (preprint, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202409.1194.v1) (mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19).

8) Relevant statistics and data from recent and foundational studies
- Embryogenesis and replication stress in worms: Depletion of cdc-48/ufd-1/npl-4 produces embryonic lethality and S-phase defects accompanied by RAD-51 foci in germline and embryonic nuclei, with hypersensitivity to replication blockade by hydroxyurea (PNAS 2008, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805944105) (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 2-4).
- Chromatin client stabilization: Loss of UBXN-3/FAF1 or depletion of UFD-1–NPL-4/CDC-48 stabilizes CDT-1 and CDC-45/GINS on chromatin and perturbs fork dynamics; these phenotypes quantify CAD failure and are suppressible by co-manipulating client levels (Nat Commun 2016, Feb 2016; https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10612) (franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 10-11, franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 1-2).
- Immune response reprogramming: Inhibition of UFD-1–NPL-4 activates an ELT-2–dependent immune signature and alters survival on Pseudomonas aeruginosa despite reduced colonization (bioRxiv posting Dec 12, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.12.571255) (rao2025inhibitionofthe pages 1-4).

9) Substrate specificity and biochemical role
- Substrates/clients: Although UFD-1 is not an enzyme, the cofactor complex selects ubiquitylated substrates. In worms, clients implicated include CDT-1 and CDC-45/GINS/CMG helicase components during replication, and ERAD substrates at the ER (franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 10-11, mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2). UFD-1–NPL-4 provides the ubiquitin-binding and client-recruitment activity; CDC-48 provides ATPase-driven unfolding/extraction (dressler2016theaaaatpasep97 pages 31-34, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19).

10) Localization and site of action
- UFD-1–NPL-4 concentrates in nuclei post-mitosis where it collaborates with CDC-48 in chromatin-associated client extraction; it also acts at the ER membrane in ERAD; both are consistent with the dual roles in proteostasis and replication (PNAS 2008, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805944105) (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2).

Verification recap (per the user’s mandatory steps)
- Symbol and organism: ufd-1 in C. elegans encodes UFD-1, matching the UniProt Q19584 context; key worm literature uses ufd-1 and establishes its role with CDC-48/NPL-4 (PNAS 2008) (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 2-4).
- Family/domains: Literature consistently treats UFD-1 as the conserved UFD1-family cofactor partnering with NPL-4 for CDC-48/p97; mechanistic reviews corroborate UFD1–NPL4 as the principal ubiquitin receptor module for p97 (dressler2016theaaaatpasep97 pages 31-34, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19).
- Ambiguity check: No conflicting “ufd-1” gene usage in other worm contexts was identified in the reviewed sources.

Summary
C. elegans ufd-1 encodes a conserved UFD1-family cofactor that heterodimerizes with NPL-4 to form the principal ubiquitin receptor module for the CDC-48/p97 segregase. In worms, this complex executes ERAD and, crucially, chromatin-associated degradation during DNA replication, ensuring turnover of licensing factors (e.g., CDT-1) and promoting removal/disassembly of CDC-45/GINS/CMG to preserve fork progression and genome stability. Nuclear accumulation of UFD-1/NPL-4 post-mitosis aligns with S-phase functions. Depletion produces embryonic lethality, replication stress, RAD-51 foci, and germline defects; recent preprint work links UFD-1–NPL-4 inhibition to an ELT-2–mediated immune-like state. These functions are mechanistically underpinned by UFD-1–NPL-4’s ubiquitin-binding and client recruitment to CDC-48, a paradigm consolidated by 2016 worm studies and 2024 mechanistic syntheses (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 10-11, dressler2016theaaaatpasep97 pages 31-34, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19, rao2025inhibitionofthe pages 1-4, franz2016ringofchange pages 4-5).
