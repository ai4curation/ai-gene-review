# ANNOTATION 1
- term:
    id: GO:0036503
    label: ERAD pathway
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: UFD-1 functions as part of the CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 complex in ER-associated
      protein degradation (ERAD). This annotation is strongly supported by direct
      experimental evidence in C. elegans showing that ufd-1 RNAi induces ER stress
      and causes accumulation of misfolded proteins (PMID:16647269). The IBA annotation
      is consistent with the conserved function across eukaryotes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core function of UFD-1. The CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 complex is required
      for the cytoplasmic elimination of misfolded proteins exported from the ER,
      preventing activation of the unfolded protein response. Direct experimental
      evidence in C. elegans confirms this conserved role.

      supporting_text: In Caenorhabditis elegans two homologs of p97, designated CDC-48.1
        and CDC-48.2, exist. Our results indicate that both p97 homologs interact
        with UFD-1/NPL-4 in a similar CDC-48(UFD-1/NPL-4) complex. RNAi mediated depletion
        of the corresponding genes induces ER stress resulting in hypersensitivity
        to conditions which induce increased levels of unfolded proteins in the ER
        lumen.

# ANNOTATION 2
- term:
    id: GO:0031593
    label: polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: UFD-1 contains domains that recognize ubiquitinated substrates as part
      of the CDC-48 segregase complex. This molecular function is conserved across
      eukaryotes and enables substrate recruitment to the CDC-48 machinery for extraction
      and degradation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core molecular function of UFD-1. The ability to bind polyubiquitinated
      proteins is essential for UFD-1's role in directing CDC-48 to its substrates
      in both ERAD and chromatin-associated degradation pathways. The IBA annotation
      reflects the conserved biochemical function of the UFD1 family.

      supporting_text: It has been reported that the AAA ATPase p97/VCP/CDC48 is required
        in this pathway for protein dislocation across the ER membrane and subsequent
        ubiquitin dependent degradation by the 26S proteasome in the cytosol. Throughout
        ER-associated protein degradation, p97 cooperates with a binary Ufd1/Npl4-complex.

# ANNOTATION 3
- term:
    id: GO:0034098
    label: VCP-NPL4-UFD1 AAA ATPase complex
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: UFD-1 is a core component of the CDC-48/NPL-4/UFD-1 complex (the C. elegans
      equivalent of the mammalian VCP-NPL4-UFD1 complex). This is extensively documented
      with direct experimental evidence showing physical interaction between UFD-1,
      CDC-48.1, CDC-48.2, and NPL-4 in C. elegans.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a fundamental aspect of UFD-1 function. Multiple studies demonstrate
      that UFD-1 forms a stable complex with CDC-48 and NPL-4 in C. elegans, with
      co-immunoprecipitation and functional studies confirming this complex.

# ANNOTATION 4
- term:
    id: GO:0005634
    label: nucleus
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: UFD-1 localizes to both nucleus and cytoplasm in a cell-cycle dependent
      manner. Nuclear localization is supported by experimental evidence showing UFD-1
      is present in purified nuclei and functions in chromatin-associated degradation
      during DNA replication.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IEA annotation based on UniProt subcellular location is consistent
      with direct experimental evidence. UFD-1 enters the nucleus upon nuclear membrane
      re-assembly in a CDC-48-dependent manner and functions there during S phase.

# ANNOTATION 5
- term:
    id: GO:0005737
    label: cytoplasm
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: UFD-1 localizes to the cytoplasm during mitosis, where it also functions
      in ERAD by extracting misfolded proteins from the ER for proteasomal degradation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IEA annotation is consistent with the known functions of UFD-1 in
      ERAD, which occurs in the cytoplasm. UFD-1 shows dynamic localization between
      cytoplasm and nucleus depending on cell cycle stage.

# ANNOTATION 6
- term:
    id: GO:0006511
    label: ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: UFD-1 functions in the ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway, facilitating
      the targeting of ubiquitinated substrates for proteasomal degradation. This
      is consistent with the InterPro domain annotation and the well-characterized
      function of UFD1 family proteins.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately reflects UFD-1's role in promoting proteasomal
      degradation of ubiquitinated substrates. The CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 complex extracts
      ubiquitinated proteins and delivers them to the proteasome.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: UFD-1 promotes proteasomal degradation as part of the CDC-48 complex,
      which extracts ubiquitinated substrates and delivers them to the 26S proteasome.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is consistent with the known function of the CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4
      complex in promoting proteasomal degradation of extracted substrates. The ARBA
      machine learning inference is supported by experimental evidence.

# ANNOTATION 8
- term:
    id: GO:0005515
    label: protein binding
  evidence_type: IPI
  original_reference_id: PMID:11731503
  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on interolog prediction from conserved protein-protein
      interactions. The interaction partner is NPL-4.2 (Q95QZ9). While the interaction
      is valid, the term 'protein binding' is too general and should be replaced with
      more informative terms.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The generic 'protein binding' annotation should be replaced with more
      specific terms that describe the functional nature of the interaction. UFD-1
      interacts with NPL-4 as part of a functional heterodimeric cofactor for CDC-48,
      which is better captured by the VCP-NPL4-UFD1 complex annotation.

# ANNOTATION 9
- term:
    id: GO:0005515
    label: protein binding
  evidence_type: IPI
  original_reference_id: PMID:14704431
  review:
    summary: This annotation derives from the C. elegans interactome mapping project.
      The interaction with NPL-4.2 was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening.
      While valid, 'protein binding' is too general.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The Y2H-based interaction data should be annotated with more specific
      terms. The UFD-1/NPL-4 interaction forms a functional heterodimer that serves
      as the CDC-48 cofactor.

    label: protein binding
  evidence_type: IPI
  original_reference_id: PMID:20977550
  review:
    summary: This annotation documents UFD-1 interactions with CDC-48.1 (P54811) and
      UBX domain-containing proteins (H2KYU6, H2L056). The study demonstrates that
      UBXN proteins, UFD-1, and NPL-4 can simultaneously associate with CDC-48 hexamers.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The generic 'protein binding' should be replaced with the more informative
      complex membership annotation, as these interactions occur in the context of
      the functional CDC-48 segregase complex.

  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:20977550
  review:
    summary: This annotation documents direct experimental evidence showing UFD-1
      is part of a complex with CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 in C. elegans. The study demonstrated
      these proteins form stable complexes that regulate spermatogenesis.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Direct experimental evidence from co-IP and functional studies confirms
      UFD-1 as a component of the CDC-48 complex in C. elegans. This is a core aspect
      of UFD-1 function.
    supported_by:

# ANNOTATION 12
- term:
    id: GO:0044877
    label: protein-containing complex binding
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:20977550
  review:
    summary: This annotation indicates UFD-1 can bind protein complexes. While technically
      accurate, this is a very general term. UFD-1 binds to the CDC-48 hexamer and
      may also interact with substrate complexes during extraction.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While not incorrect, this is a very general annotation. The more specific
      complex membership (VCP-NPL4-UFD1 AAA ATPase complex) better captures the functional
      relevance. This annotation can be retained as non-core.

# ANNOTATION 13
- term:
    id: GO:1900182
    label: positive regulation of protein localization to nucleus
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:26842564
  review:
    summary: PMID:26842564 demonstrates that proper nuclear localization of UBXN-3
      during S phase depends on a functional CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 complex. RNAi depletion
      of CDC-48 or UFD-1/NPL-4 results in formation of UBXN-3-positive punctae in
      the nucleoplasm rather than normal diffuse nuclear localization. Thus, UFD-1
      positively regulates UBXN-3 nuclear localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately reflects a specific regulatory function of
      UFD-1 documented in the cited publication. The CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 complex is
      required for proper UBXN-3 nuclear localization during S phase, which is important
      for chromatin-associated degradation.

  review:
    summary: 'IMPORTANT: This annotation appears to cite the wrong publication. PMID:18723220
      is a study about pesticide toxicity in C. elegans and earthworms, not about
      ufd-1 localization. The correct reference for ufd-1 nuclear localization is
      likely PMID:18728180, which demonstrates UFD-1 nuclear localization during cell
      cycle progression.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The nuclear localization of UFD-1 is well-supported by PMID:18728180,
      which shows that the CDC-48(UFD-1/NPL-4) complex functions in S phase progression
      and is essential for embryonic cell division. The IEA annotation for nucleus
      (GO:0005634) also supports this localization. The cited PMID:18723220 appears
      to be a curation error but the annotation itself is valid.

    label: embryo development ending in birth or egg hatching
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:16647269
  review:
    summary: RNAi-mediated knockdown of ufd-1 causes embryonic lethality in C. elegans,
      demonstrating that UFD-1 is required for embryonic development. However, this
      is a phenotypic annotation rather than describing a specific molecular function
      in development.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While UFD-1 is essential for embryonic development, this represents a
      phenotypic consequence of UFD-1 loss rather than a specific developmental function.
      The lethality results from failure of core cellular processes (ERAD, DNA replication)
      rather than a developmental regulatory role. This should be kept as a non-core
      annotation.

    summary: Direct experimental evidence from RNAi studies demonstrates UFD-1 is
      required for ERAD in C. elegans. Depletion of ufd-1 induces ER stress and causes
      accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core function of UFD-1 with strong experimental support. The
      CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 complex is essential for extracting misfolded proteins from
      the ER for degradation.
