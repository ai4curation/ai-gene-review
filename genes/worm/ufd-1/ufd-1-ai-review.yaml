description: 'UFD-1 (Ubiquitin Fusion Degradation protein 1) is an essential cofactor
  of the CDC-48/p97 AAA ATPase segregase complex in C. elegans. Together with NPL-4,
  UFD-1 forms a heterodimeric cofactor that directs CDC-48 activity toward polyubiquitinated
  substrates. The CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 complex plays critical roles in two major cellular
  processes: (1) ER-associated degradation (ERAD), where it extracts misfolded ubiquitinated
  proteins from the ER membrane for proteasomal degradation, and (2) DNA replication
  regulation, where it coordinates the degradation of replication licensing factors
  and the disassembly of replisome components. UFD-1 is essential for embryonic development,
  with RNAi knockdown causing embryonic lethality due to S-phase progression defects
  and activation of the DNA replication checkpoint. In adults, UFD-1 depletion causes
  germline developmental defects and accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER.'

  review:
    summary: UFD-1 functions as part of the CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 complex in ER-associated
      protein degradation (ERAD). This annotation is strongly supported by direct
      experimental evidence in C. elegans showing that ufd-1 RNAi induces ER stress
      and causes accumulation of misfolded proteins (PMID:16647269). The IBA annotation
      is consistent with the conserved function across eukaryotes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core function of UFD-1. The CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 complex is required
      for the cytoplasmic elimination of misfolded proteins exported from the ER,
      preventing activation of the unfolded protein response. Direct experimental
      evidence in C. elegans confirms this conserved role.

        with UFD-1/NPL-4 in a similar CDC-48(UFD-1/NPL-4) complex. RNAi mediated depletion
        of the corresponding genes induces ER stress resulting in hypersensitivity
        to conditions which induce increased levels of unfolded proteins in the ER
        lumen.

    label: polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: UFD-1 contains domains that recognize ubiquitinated substrates as part
      of the CDC-48 segregase complex. This molecular function is conserved across
      eukaryotes and enables substrate recruitment to the CDC-48 machinery for extraction
      and degradation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core molecular function of UFD-1. The ability to bind polyubiquitinated
      proteins is essential for UFD-1's role in directing CDC-48 to its substrates
      in both ERAD and chromatin-associated degradation pathways. The IBA annotation
      reflects the conserved biochemical function of the UFD1 family.

  review:
    summary: UFD-1 is a core component of the CDC-48/NPL-4/UFD-1 complex (the C. elegans
      equivalent of the mammalian VCP-NPL4-UFD1 complex). This is extensively documented
      with direct experimental evidence showing physical interaction between UFD-1,
      CDC-48.1, CDC-48.2, and NPL-4 in C. elegans.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a fundamental aspect of UFD-1 function. Multiple studies demonstrate

  review:
    summary: PMID:26842564 demonstrates that proper nuclear localization of UBXN-3
      during S phase depends on a functional CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 complex. RNAi depletion
      of CDC-48 or UFD-1/NPL-4 results in formation of UBXN-3-positive punctae in
      the nucleoplasm rather than normal diffuse nuclear localization. Thus, UFD-1
      positively regulates UBXN-3 nuclear localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately reflects a specific regulatory function of
      UFD-1 documented in the cited publication. The CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 complex is
      required for proper UBXN-3 nuclear localization during S phase, which is important

      of CDT-1 and disassembly of CDC-45/GINS at the chromatin
core_functions:
- description: UFD-1 is a core component of the CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 segregase complex.
    This heterohexameric complex, with CDC-48 providing ATPase activity and UFD-1/NPL-4
    providing substrate recognition and cofactor function, is essential for multiple
    protein quality control and cell cycle regulatory processes.

suggested_questions:
- question: Does C. elegans UFD-1 have specific roles in chromatin-associated degradation
    beyond UBXN-3/CDT-1 regulation? While studies have focused on UBXN-3-dependent
    functions, the mammalian VCP/p97 complex has many chromatin substrates. Systematic
    identification of UFD-1-dependent chromatin substrates in C. elegans would be
    valuable.
- question: Are there tissue-specific functions of UFD-1 beyond germline and embryonic
    development? Most studies focus on early development. Understanding UFD-1 function
    in differentiated adult tissues could reveal additional roles.
suggested_experiments:
- description: Proximity labeling (BioID or TurboID) to identify UFD-1-proximal proteins
    in different subcellular compartments and cell cycle stages. This would provide
    a comprehensive view of UFD-1 interaction partners and potential substrates beyond
    those currently characterized.
- description: Structure-function analysis of UFD-1 domains to determine requirements
    for ERAD vs. chromatin-associated degradation functions. Understanding whether
    these functions are separable could provide insights into pathway-specific regulation.
