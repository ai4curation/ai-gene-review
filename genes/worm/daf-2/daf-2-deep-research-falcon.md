## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q968Y9
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Insulin-like receptor {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P06213}; Short=IR {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P06213}; EC=2.7.10.1; AltName: Full=Abnormal dauer formation protein 2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9252323}; Contains: RecName: Full=Insulin-like receptor subunit alpha {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P06213}; Contains: RecName: Full=Insulin-like receptor subunit beta {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P06213}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=daf-2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y55D5A.5a}; ORFNames=Y55D5A.5 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y55D5A.5a};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. Tyr protein
- **Key Domains:** FN3_dom. (IPR003961); FN3_sf. (IPR036116); Furin-like_Cys-rich_dom. (IPR006211); Growth_fac_rcpt_cys_sf. (IPR009030); Ig-like_fold. (IPR013783)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "daf-2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'daf-2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **daf-2** (gene ID: daf-2, UniProt: Q968Y9) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: daf-2 (UniProt Q968Y9) encodes the sole Caenorhabditis elegans insulin/IGF-1 receptor-like tyrosine kinase. It is a single-pass plasma membrane receptor with extracellular ligand-binding domains and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, homologous to mammalian insulin/IGF-1 receptors (Kimura et al. 1997, Science; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.277.5328.942). Ubiquitous expression with plasma membrane localization was confirmed by endogenous DAF-2 knock-in reporters (Zhang et al. 2022, Nat Commun; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33850-4). The organism is C. elegans, consistent with the request. Domain/family assignment as a receptor tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor family aligns with literature (Kimura 1997; Henderson et al. 2005). No conflicting gene symbol usage was identified in other organisms within the cited set. (zhang2022intestinespecificremovalof pages 1-2, henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 3-6, henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 6-8)

Comprehensive research report
1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Definition: daf-2 encodes the insulin/IGF-1 receptor ortholog in C. elegans, a receptor tyrosine kinase that initiates insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS). Activation by insulin-like peptides (ILPs) promotes growth, reproduction, and prevents dauer; reduced signaling promotes dauer formation and extends lifespan. (Kimura 1997, Science; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.277.5328.942) ()
- Canonical IIS cascade: DAF-2 → AGE-1/PI3K → PIP3 → PDK-1 → AKT-1/AKT-2 and SGK-1 → inhibition (cytoplasmic retention) of DAF-16/FOXO. The lipid phosphatase DAF-18/PTEN antagonizes AGE-1 (reduces PIP3) and thereby activates DAF-16 nuclear translocation when IIS is low. This pathway controls diapause (dauer), metabolism, stress resistance, and longevity. URLs: Paradis & Ruvkun 1998, Genes Dev (https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.12.16.2488); Paradis et al. 1999, Genes Dev (https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.13.11.1438); Ogg & Ruvkun 1998, Mol Cell (https://doi.org/10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80303-2); Hertweck et al. 2004, Dev Cell (https://doi.org/10.1016/S1534-5807(04)00095-4). (laskovs2024investigatingthemetabolic pages 18-21, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 11-15, fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 7-8)
- Transcriptional effector: DAF-16/FOXO is necessary for daf-2 longevity and dauer phenotypes; IIS-dependent AKT/SGK phosphorylation excludes DAF-16 from the nucleus; reduced IIS permits nuclear DAF-16 to activate stress response and longevity genes (e.g., sod-3, sHSPs). URLs: Ogg et al. 1997, Nature (https://doi.org/10.1038/40194); Lee et al. 2003, Science (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1083614). (artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 11-15)
- Ligands: C. elegans expresses a large family of insulin-like peptides (ILPs). Examples include neuronal agonists INS-4 and INS-6; overall, ILPs may act as agonists or antagonists at DAF-2 and are produced by multiple tissues (neurons, intestine, hypodermis). Review perspective: Selvarasu et al. 2025, J Biosci (https://doi.org/10.1007/s12038-025-00517-3). (selvarasu2025themanyroads pages 6-7)
- Subcellular localization and tissue expression: Endogenous tagging shows broad expression (neurons, XXX cells, vulval cells, germ cells and oocytes) with plasma membrane localization; intestine plays a dominant role for lifespan regulation via intracellular DAF-2→DAF-16 signaling. URL: Zhang et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33850-4). (zhang2022intestinespecificremovalof pages 1-2)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Tissue- and time-specific DAF-2 roles in aging and mobility: A 2024 synthesis emphasizes that neuronal and intestinal DAF-2 activities primarily set lifespan, whereas muscle DAF-2 can affect mid-life mobility in a DAF-16–independent manner via UNC-120/SRF; neuronal and muscle DAF-2 promote age-associated muscle mitochondrial fragmentation. This review also discusses best practices and pitfalls for tissue/time-specific AID degradation tools. URL: Fabrizio et al. 2024, Cells (https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13030288). (fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 5-7, fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 7-8)
- Non-autonomous regulation of memory by hypodermal DAF-2: Degrading DAF-2 specifically in hypodermis improves short-term associative memory via secretion of the Notch ligand OSM-11 and neuronal Notch/CREB activation, revealing a body-to-brain IIS–Notch–CREB axis. Preprint 2023; the 2025 journal version elaborates similar biology. URL: Zhou et al. 2023, bioRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.16.528821). (henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 6-8)
- Non-autonomous control of germline mitotic progression: daf-2 mutations delay germline stem/progenitor cell mitosis in vivo; delays require canonical DAF-2→DAF-16 signaling but act cell non-autonomously from soma. The spindle assembly checkpoint is engaged without increased mitotic errors; caloric restriction delays mitosis via AMPK independently of IIS. URL: Cheng et al. 2024, PLOS Genet (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011351). (artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 11-15)
- Non-cell-autonomous control of germline proteostasis and fecundity through intestinal peptide uptake: High IIS upregulates intestinal PEPT-1 via DAF-16 repression, increasing dietary peptide uptake that fuels germline translation; reduced IIS confers resilience to proteostatic stress by lowering ribosome biogenesis and translation. URL: Muhammad et al. 2024, EMBO J (https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00234-x). ()
- Late-life daf-2 degradation rejuvenates proteostasis and stress resilience: Even in advanced ages, auxin-induced degradation of DAF-2 in neurons or intestine markedly extends lifespan, restores proteostasis capacity (aggregate clearance), and increases stress resistance—indicating partial reversibility of frailty via IIS reduction. URL: Molière et al. 2024, GeroScience (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01232-x). (fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 5-7)
- Transgenerational metabolic programming by somatic IIS/DAF-16: Starvation alters somatic DAF-16 activity to program metabolism and behavior across generations; tissue-specific depletion shows somatic, not germline, DAF-16 initiates and manifests programming. URL: Vogt & Hobert 2023, Sci Adv (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ade1817). (henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 6-8)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Tissue-specific AID (auxin-inducible degradation) of endogenously tagged DAF-2 is now widely used to probe tissue/time-resolved IIS effects on lifespan, mobility, memory, proteostasis, and germline biology. Implementation details and cautions (e.g., auxin dose effects; multicopy reporter artifacts) are described in recent work. URLs: Zhang et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33850-4); Fabrizio et al. 2024 (https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13030288); Zhou et al. 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.16.528821); Molière et al. 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01232-x). (zhang2022intestinespecificremovalof pages 1-2, fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 5-7, fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 7-8, henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 6-8)
- IIS modulation to enhance proteostasis and stress tolerance in aged animals: Late-life DAF-2 degradation reverses proteostasis decline and boosts stress resistance, suggesting translational strategies targeting IIS in aging. URL: Molière et al. 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01232-x). (fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 5-7)
- Mapping non-autonomous endocrine axes: Hypodermis-to-neuron Notch signaling and intestine-to-germline nutrient signaling illustrate systemic IIS control over cognition and reproduction, informing organism-level interventions. URLs: Zhou et al. 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.16.528821); Muhammad et al. 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00234-x). (henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 6-8)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Fabrizio et al. 2024 review synthesizes tissue/temporal dissection of DAF-2/IIS, highlighting that ubiquitous IIS reduction yields greater lifespan extension than combined neuronal+gut inactivation, and that healthspan metrics (mobility) can uncouple from lifespan depending on tissue and timing. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13030288. (fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 5-7, fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 7-8)
- Henderson et al. 2005 review outlines the canonical IIS module and its centrality to aging and dauer control, with quantitative ranges of lifespan effects and tissue integrity preservation by reduced IIS. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-012088387-5/50016-9. (henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 8-10, henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 3-6, henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 6-8)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies and foundational work
- Lifespan extension magnitudes:
  • daf-2 mutation or RNAi can more than double mean lifespan; classic daf-2(e1370) approximately doubles lifespan, requiring daf-16/FOXO. URLs: Kimura 1997 (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.277.5328.942); Henderson 2005 (https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-012088387-5/50016-9). (henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 3-6, henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 6-8)
  • Intestine-specific DAF-2 removal extends lifespan by ~94% with minimal reproduction/development costs; DAF-16 activated in and beyond intestine, with partial requirement for non-intestinal DAF-16. URL: Zhang 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33850-4). (zhang2022intestinespecificremovalof pages 1-2)
  • Late-life DAF-2 degradation in single tissues markedly increases lifespan and restores proteostasis and stress resistance (quantitative survival increases vary by age/tissue in that study). URL: Molière 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01232-x). (fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 5-7)
- Dauer and development:
  • Active IIS promotes continuous development; loss of IIS triggers dauer arrest. ILPs act as agonists/antagonists at DAF-2, with neuronal ILPs (INS-4/INS-6) exemplifying agonists that activate DAF-2 in intestinal/hypodermal targets. URL: Selvarasu 2025 (https://doi.org/10.1007/s12038-025-00517-3). (selvarasu2025themanyroads pages 6-7)
- Non-autonomous effects:
  • Hypodermal DAF-2 degradation improves short-term memory via OSM-11 Notch ligand, neuronal Notch/CREB, and suppresses ins-19; mid-life OSM-11 overexpression improves memory and slows cognitive decline (quantitative improvements in memory retention time reported in the study’s assays). URL: Zhou 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.16.528821). (henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 6-8)
  • daf-2 reduction delays germline mitosis via canonical IIS→DAF-16 and soma-to-germline non-autonomous signaling, engaging the spindle assembly checkpoint without fidelity loss; caloric restriction acts instead through AMPK. URL: Cheng 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011351). (artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 11-15)
  • IIS controls germline proteostasis and fecundity by regulating intestinal PEPT-1 and dietary peptide uptake; reduced IIS confers proteostasis resilience by lowering translation. URL: Muhammad 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00234-x). ()

Biochemical function and substrate specificity
- Receptor class and catalytic function: DAF-2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase; ligand binding induces autophosphorylation and recruitment/activation of downstream insulin signaling components (IRS-like, AGE-1/PI3K). The Tyr-XX-Met motif (e.g., Tyr1626) mediates interaction with AGE-1/PI3K. URL: Kimura 1997 (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.277.5328.942). ()
- Downstream kinases and targets: AGE-1 generates PIP3 to recruit PDK-1, which phosphorylates/activates AKT-1/AKT-2 and SGK-1; these kinases phosphorylate DAF-16 to inhibit its nuclear localization. URLs: Paradis & Ruvkun 1998 (https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.12.16.2488); Paradis et al. 1999 (https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.13.11.1438); Hertweck et al. 2004 (https://doi.org/10.1016/S1534-5807(04)00095-4). (laskovs2024investigatingthemetabolic pages 18-21, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 11-15, fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 7-8)
- Negative regulation: DAF-18/PTEN dephosphorylates PIP3, opposing IIS and enabling DAF-16 nuclear entry upon IIS reduction. URL: Ogg & Ruvkun 1998 (https://doi.org/10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80303-2). (fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 7-8)

Localization and tissues where DAF-2 acts
- Subcellular localization: plasma membrane receptor; broadly expressed (neurons, XXX cells, vulval cells, germline) with strong functional action in intestine for lifespan control, and in hypodermis/neurons for memory and mobility. URL: Zhang 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33850-4); Zhou 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.16.528821); Fabrizio 2024 (https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13030288). (zhang2022intestinespecificremovalof pages 1-2, henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 6-8, fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 5-7)

Pathway context and crosstalk
- IIS integrates with dauer and metabolic programs, and cross-talks with stress pathways; tissue- and age-specific modulation yields distinct phenotypes (lifespan vs. mobility vs. cognition). Reviews and recent work emphasize careful dissection of tissue autonomy and non-autonomy in IIS biology. URLs: Fabrizio 2024 (https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13030288); Vogt 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ade1817). (fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 5-7, fabrizio2024consideringcaenorhabditiselegans pages 7-8, henderson2005dissectingtheprocesses pages 6-8)

Notes on gene/protein identification and ambiguity
- The symbol daf-2 in C. elegans unambiguously refers to the insulin/IGF-1 receptor ortholog described above. No conflicting gene with identical symbol in a different organism was used to source claims here. Domain/family identity as an insulin receptor-class receptor tyrosine kinase aligns with the UniProt description. (zhang2022intestinespecificremovalof pages 1-2)
