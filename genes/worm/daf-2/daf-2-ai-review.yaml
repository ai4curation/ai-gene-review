description: DAF-2 is the C. elegans insulin/IGF-1 receptor ortholog that 
  functions as a receptor tyrosine kinase to regulate metabolism, longevity, 
  dauer diapause formation, and stress resistance. DAF-2 signals through a 
  conserved PI3K/AKT pathway (via AGE-1/AKT-1/AKT-2) to negatively regulate the 
  FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 and the Nrf transcription factor SKN-1. 
  Reduced DAF-2 signaling leads to DAF-16 nuclear localization, activation of 
  longevity genes, enhanced stress resistance, increased fat storage, and entry 
  into the dauer diapause stage. DAF-2 is expressed in neurons, intestine, and 
  other tissues, and functions cell-nonautonomously to coordinate organismal 
  growth, metabolism, and aging through secondary signaling cascades.

  review:
    summary: DAF-2 is the C. elegans insulin/IGF-1 receptor ortholog. The 
      seminal discovery paper (PMID:9252323) identified daf-2 as encoding "an 
      insulin receptor family member" regulating longevity and dauer diapause. 
      The protein contains characteristic receptor tyrosine kinase domains and 
      functions analogously to mammalian insulin receptors.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a well-established core function of DAF-2. The original 
      cloning paper demonstrated sequence homology to insulin receptor family 
      members, and extensive genetic and biochemical studies have confirmed 
      DAF-2 acts as an insulin/IGF-1-like receptor controlling metabolism, 
      development, and lifespan. The IBA annotation reflects conserved 
      phylogenetic function.

  review:
    summary: As a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, DAF-2 localizes to the
      plasma membrane. This is consistent with its function as a cell surface 
      receptor and has been directly confirmed by IDA evidence (PMID:24120884).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Plasma membrane localization is expected for a transmembrane 
      receptor and is supported by direct experimental evidence showing 
      DAF-2::GFP at the plasma membrane in oocytes and neurons. The IBA 
      annotation is phylogenetically consistent with characterized orthologs.

  review:
    summary: DAF-2 is the core receptor initiating insulin/IGF-1-like signaling 
      in C. elegans. The pathway involves AGE-1 (PI3K), PDK-1, AKT-1/2, and 
      culminates in regulation of the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the central biological pathway through which DAF-2 
      functions. Extensive genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate DAF-2 
      signals through a conserved PI3K/AKT cascade to regulate DAF-16, 
      controlling longevity, metabolism, and dauer formation.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Direct evidence from PMID:24120884 demonstrates DAF-2 activates

    reason: While DAF-2 does contain fibronectin type III domains, there is no
