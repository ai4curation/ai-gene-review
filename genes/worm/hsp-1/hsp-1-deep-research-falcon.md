- **Gene Information:** Name=hsp-1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:F26D10.3}; Synonyms=hsp70a {ECO:0000303|PubMed:2841196}; ORFNames=F26D10.3 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:F26D10.3};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family. .
- **Key Domains:** ATPase_NBD. (IPR043129); Heat_shock_70_CS. (IPR018181); HSP70_C_sf. (IPR029048); HSP70_peptide-bd_sf. (IPR029047); Hsp_70_fam. (IPR013126)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "hsp-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'hsp-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **hsp-1** (gene ID: hsp-1, UniProt: P09446) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: hsp-1 (C. elegans Hsp70/Hsc70; UniProt P09446)

Executive summary
hsp-1 encodes the major cytosolic Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperone of Caenorhabditis elegans (gene F26D10.3), a constitutively expressed, essential component of the proteostasis network. HSP-1 uses an ATP-driven cycle to bind and release unfolded/misfolded substrates, regulated by J-domain co-chaperones (DNAJ) and nucleotide-exchange factors (NEFs) including Hsp110 and BAG-family proteins. In C. elegans, HSP-1 cooperates with specific J-proteins and Hsp110 to power metazoan protein disaggregation in vivo, sustaining thermotolerance, fecundity, and survival after heat stress. Recent studies extend HSP-system roles to neuronal/glial integrity and tissue biomechanics, and introduce genetic and nanobody tools that modulate HSP-1 activity in vivo (preprint). (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12686, Oct 2017; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202202149, Sep 2022; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46827-2, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.25.672099, Aug 2025) (kirstein2017invivoproperties pages 1-1, urban2025hsp1specificnanobodiesalter pages 21-25)

1) Key concepts and definitions; identity verification
- Identity and organism: hsp-1 (ORF F26D10.3) is the C. elegans cytosolic Hsp70/Hsc70 ortholog, commonly referred to as HSP-1 in the worm literature, and is constitutively expressed. Multiple in vivo studies on C. elegans disaggregation and proteostasis explicitly identify HSP-1 as the Hsc70 used for substrate disaggregation and stress recovery (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12686, Oct 2017) (kirstein2017invivoproperties pages 1-1).
- Family/domains: HSP-1 belongs to the Hsp70 family and exhibits the canonical architecture with an N-terminal ATPase nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD) with a lid subdomain, consistent with UniProt P09446 domain annotations. Mechanistic and structural reviews and C. elegans-focused work outline J-domain–stimulated ATP hydrolysis for client capture and NEF-facilitated ADP release for client release/hand-off (e.g., Bag-family and Hsp110-type NEFs) (selected references summarized in thesis excerpts) (https://refhub.elsevier.com/S2211-1247(18)30979-1/sref, Jun 2018; see also mechanistic summaries cited in 2022 thesis) (schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 139-141, schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 78-129). Together, these data confirm alignment of the gene symbol, organism, and Hsp70 family/domain architecture.

2) Molecular mechanism and primary biochemical function
- ATP-driven chaperone cycle: J-domain co-chaperones (DNAJ/J-proteins) stimulate HSP-1 ATPase activity, stabilizing client binding; nucleotide-exchange factors (Hsp110 and BAG family) promote ADP release to reset HSP-1 for another cycle, enabling folding, refolding, or client hand-off to other systems (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12686, Oct 2017; mechanistic citations compiled in 2022 analysis) (kirstein2017invivoproperties pages 1-1, schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 139-141, schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 78-129).
- Disaggregation activity in metazoa: In C. elegans, an Hsp70–J-protein–Hsp110 triad functions as a metazoan disaggregase. Class A and class B J-proteins form a flexible network that relocalizes to aggregates, preferentially recruiting HSP-1 to dissolve heat-induced and age-dependent polyQ aggregates in vivo (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12686, Oct 2017) (kirstein2017invivoproperties pages 1-1).

3) Localization and essentiality in C. elegans
- Cytosolic Hsc70: HSP-1 is the major cytosolic Hsc70 in C. elegans, recruited to protein aggregates upon heat shock via J-proteins in vivo (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12686, Oct 2017) (kirstein2017invivoproperties pages 1-1).
- Essential organismal functions: HSP-1 activity is required for thermotolerance, maintenance of fecundity, and extended viability following heat stress; RNAi knockdown in the disaggregation study impaired these organismal health metrics (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12686, Oct 2017) (kirstein2017invivoproperties pages 1-1).

4) Pathways and biological processes
- Proteostasis and heat shock response: HSP-1 participates in the heat shock response (HSR) orchestrated by HSF-1. Selected HSR targets include hsp-1 alongside hsp-16 family genes; genome-wide coexpression/clique analyses reveal that only a subset of HSE-bearing genes are strongly induced under heat shock, including hsp-1 and specific J-proteins (DNJ-12, DNJ-13) (2022 thesis data) (https://nbn-resolving.org/document/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-2-1w4i2c6r2ywd5, 2022) (schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 78-129).
- Transcellular chaperone signaling (TCS): Organismal proteostasis in C. elegans is regulated by TCS; signaling modules (e.g., PQM-1 and HSP-90 perturbation) lead to tissue-nonautonomous upregulation of Hsp70/HSP-1 and small HSPs, enhancing systemic stress resilience (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.015, Jun 2013; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.05.093, Jun 2018) (schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 78-129). These studies position hsp-1 as a key target and effector in organismal proteostasis networks.

5) Experimentally supported interaction partners and in vivo functions in C. elegans
- BAG-family co-chaperone UNC-23 (BAG-2 ortholog): Genetic suppressor and interaction evidence links HSP-1 to UNC-23. Missense mutations in the HSP-1 ATPase domain suppress the unc-23(e25) muscle detachment phenotype; UNC-23 and HSP-1 interact in yeast two-hybrid assays. GFP::UNC-23 localizes to adhesion complexes in body wall muscle and hypodermis, implicating HSP-1 in muscle attachment and hypodermal integrity (https://doi.org/10.1080/21624054.2015.1023496, Mar 2015) (rahmani2015thec.elegans pages 1-2).
- J-protein partners and Hsp110 NEF in disaggregation: Class A and B J-proteins cooperate to recruit HSP-1 to aggregates; Hsp110 acts as the NEF to power disaggregation in vivo. Depletion of these co-chaperones compromises thermotolerance, fecundity, and survival after heat shock (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12686, Oct 2017) (kirstein2017invivoproperties pages 1-1).
- DNJ-13/CDC-37 and HSC-70 interplay; selective roles of J-proteins: Biochemical analysis shows many HSC-70 variants have reduced DNJ-13 binding; RNAi depletion of dnj-13 (but not dnj-12) improves locomotion in unc-23 mutants, highlighting specific J-protein roles with HSP-1. DNJ-13 also forms a complex with CDC-37 and strengthens HSP-90•CDC-37 interactions, indicating crosstalk between HSP-1/J proteins and the HSP-90 system (2022 thesis; includes analytical ultracentrifugation and crosslinking data with KD ~3 µM for CDC-37•DNJ-13) (https://nbn-resolving.org/document/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-2-1w4i2c6r2ywd5, 2022) (schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 34-78, schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 78-129).
- Small heat shock proteins and HSP-1 capacity buffering: Genetic interactions indicate sHsp-mediated sequestration buffers limited Hsp70 capacity in vivo; sequestrase-positive C. elegans sHsps exhibit sequence features enabling sequestration, and genetic links to Hsp-1 support functional interplay within the proteostasis network (https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202202149, Sep 2022) ().

6) Recent developments (2023–2024) and systems-level roles
- Glial architecture and proteostasis–biomechanics–ECM junctions: A 2024 Nature Communications study shows that disruption of epithelial Hsp70/Hsc70 co-chaperone BAG2 (UNC-23 family) causes ECM defects, altered tissue biomechanics, and temperature/mechanical hypersensitivity of CEPsh glia; modulating glial junctions or ECM mechanics rescues integrity. The work implicates HSP-1/Hsp70 cochaperone pathways in maintaining astroglial architecture across aging (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46827-2, Apr 2024; preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.28.564505, Oct 2023) (, ).
- Proteostasis and amyloid models: Recent overviews of C. elegans amyloid aggregation emphasize that compromised proteostasis induces Hsp70 expression and that hsp-1 is essential for development and stress resilience, aligning with in vivo disaggregation work (doctoral compendium, 2023) (University repository record; 2023) (urban2025hsp1specificnanobodiesalter pages 21-25).
- HSP system as temperature sensors in germline fate decisions: While focusing on the ER Hsp70 BiP (HSP-3/4 family) rather than HSP-1, a 2024 EMBO Journal study identifies BiP as a thermosensor controlling temperature-induced germline sex reversal via ERAD modulation of TRA-2. This underscores the broader role of HSP70 systems as temperature-responsive effectors in C. elegans development (https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00197-z, Aug 2024) (schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 34-78).

7) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Genetic models and organismal assays: HSP-1 function is interrogated with RNAi and co-chaperone perturbations to assay thermotolerance, fecundity, and post-stress survival, and to quantify in vivo disaggregation of heat-induced and polyQ aggregates (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12686, Oct 2017) (kirstein2017invivoproperties pages 1-1).
- Tissue-level proteostasis platforms: TCS paradigms (e.g., tissue-specific HSP-90 knockdown) are used to drive nonautonomous Hsp70/HSP-1 induction for organismal proteostasis studies (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.015, Jun 2013; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.05.093, Jun 2018) (schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 78-129).
- Emerging modulators and tools: A 2025 preprint reports two single-domain nanobodies (B12, H5) that specifically bind endogenous HSP-1, inhibit its ATPase and folding activities in vitro, and—when expressed at low levels in vivo—reduce heat-stress survival and proteotoxic-stress resistance, phenocopying hsp-1 RNAi under activating conditions. This establishes a tractable approach to acutely modulate HSP-1 in vivo for proteostasis and aging studies (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.25.672099, Aug 2025) (urban2025hsp1specificnanobodiesalter pages 25-28, urban2025hsp1specificnanobodiesalter pages 21-25).

8) Quantitative statistics and data points
- Disaggregation system requirements and organismal phenotypes: In vivo C. elegans disaggregation requires cooperation of class A and class B J-proteins with HSP-1 and Hsp110; RNAi perturbations reduce thermotolerance and fecundity and shorten survival after heat shock. HSP-1 preferentially participates over inducible Hsp70 isoforms in these assays (quantitative heat-survival and fecundity metrics reported in figures of the 2017 Aging Cell study) (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12686, Oct 2017) (kirstein2017invivoproperties pages 1-1).
- DNJ-13/CDC-37 complex: Analytical ultracentrifugation and crosslinking support a CDC-37•DNJ-13 complex with an apparent 1:2 stoichiometry and ~3 µM KD, which strengthens HSP-90•CDC-37 complex formation and modulates nucleotide-dependent effects (https://nbn-resolving.org/document/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-2-1w4i2c6r2ywd5, 2022) (schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 34-78).
- Nanobody modulation of HSP-1 (preprint): Two nanobodies (B12, H5) differing by two residues in CDR1 inhibit HSP-1 ATPase and refolding in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, B12 expression reduces heat-stress survival and accelerates Aβ-associated paralysis at 25 °C under an hsp-16.48 promoter, mimicking hsp-1 knockdown; no phenotype is observed at 15 °C when the promoter is inactive (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.25.672099, Aug 2025) (urban2025hsp1specificnanobodiesalter pages 21-25).

Expert perspectives and analysis
- The C. elegans Hsp70 system centered on HSP-1 provides a metazoan framework for ATP-driven disaggregation without Hsp100, relying on combinatorial J-protein networks and Hsp110 NEFs. This confers tunability via co-chaperone composition, enabling tissue-specific proteostasis control and nonautonomous signaling through TCS. Genetic interaction with BAG-family proteins (UNC-23/BAG-2) indicates that NEF/regulators position HSP-1 activity within adhesion/ECM and biomechanics contexts, aligning with emerging organismal and glial architecture phenotypes in 2023–2024 reports (https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12686, Oct 2017; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202202149, Sep 2022; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46827-2, Apr 2024) (kirstein2017invivoproperties pages 1-1).

Notes on symbol ambiguity
- The symbol “hsp-1” can refer to distinct Hsp70s across species. Here, all cited C. elegans sources refer to the cytosolic Hsc70 ortholog HSP-1 encoded by F26D10.3 (UniProt P09446). Where Hsp70 family members differ (e.g., ER BiP/GRP78), we indicate that explicitly; BiP-related findings are leveraged as system-level HSP70 insights, not as properties of HSP-1 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00197-z, Aug 2024) (schmauder2022regulationandmechanistical pages 34-78).
