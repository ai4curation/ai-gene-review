description: HSP-1 is the constitutive cytosolic heat shock cognate 70 kDa 
  protein (Hsc70) in C. elegans, orthologous to human HSPA8. It functions as an 
  ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that binds unfolded or misfolded proteins 
  and assists in their refolding through cycles of ATP hydrolysis-driven 
  substrate binding and release. HSP-1 is expressed constitutively at high 
  levels but also shows modest heat-inducibility (2-6 fold). It interacts with 
  co-chaperones including STI-1/Hop (linking Hsc70 and Hsp90 systems), BAG 
  domain proteins like UNC-23 (which regulates the ATPase cycle), and J-domain 
  proteins like RME-8 (for endosomal function) and DNJ-13 (for muscle function).
  HSP-1 plays essential roles in proteostasis, muscle functionality, endosomal 
  trafficking, regulation of DAF-16-mediated stress responses, and longevity.

      summary: IBA annotation for nuclear localization based on phylogenetic 
        inference from orthologs including human HSPA8. This is consistent with 
        experimental evidence from C. elegans showing HSP-1 nuclear localization
        during stress conditions (PMID:19858203).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: HSP70 family members are known to shuttle between cytoplasm and 
        nucleus, particularly under stress conditions. The IBA annotation is

    review:
      summary: IDA annotation for cytoplasmic localization. Note that this paper
        primarily discusses HSP-6 (mitochondrial hsp70/mthsp70), not HSP-1, but 
        confirms cytoplasmic localization of cytosolic hsp70 family members.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Cytoplasmic localization is well-established for HSP-1/Hsc70. The 
        annotation is consistent with the constitutive cytoplasmic chaperone 
        function of this protein.

    original_reference_id: PMID:14668486
    review:
      summary: IGI annotation indicating HSP-1 is involved in lifespan 
        determination based on genetic interaction with age-1 (insulin-like 
        signaling pathway mutant). Down-regulation of individual molecular 
        chaperones decreased longevity of long-lived ILS mutants.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: This annotation reflects the pleiotropic role of HSP-1 in 
        longevity through its chaperone function and interaction with the 
        insulin-like signaling pathway. While experimentally supported, lifespan
        determination is a downstream phenotypic consequence of the core 
        proteostasis function rather than a primary molecular role.

        determination based on RNAi knockdown phenotypes in long-lived ILS 
        mutant backgrounds.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: This annotation documents the phenotypic consequence of HSP-1 loss
        on longevity. The effect on lifespan is likely mediated through the core
        proteostasis function of HSP-1 rather than representing a specific 
        molecular function in aging regulation.

    review:
      summary: IDA annotation for heat response based on the original 
        characterization of the hsp70 gene family showing 2-6 fold induction of 
        hsp70A (hsp-1) transcripts upon heat shock.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is the foundational paper characterizing hsp-1 as a

        levels increase significantly upon heat stress, validating involvement 
        in the heat shock response.

    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: Proposed new annotation based on the core function of HSP70 
        chaperones. HSP-1 binds unfolded or misfolded proteins through its 
        C-terminal substrate-binding domain, which is essential for chaperone 
        function.
      action: NEW
      reason: Unfolded protein binding is a core molecular function of HSP70 
        family proteins. The substrate-binding domain of Hsc70 recognizes and 
        binds exposed hydrophobic regions of unfolded client proteins. This is 
        phylogenetically conserved and well-documented.
