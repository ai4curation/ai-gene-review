description: BBS-2 is a core component of the BBSome, a conserved octameric 
  complex essential for ciliary protein trafficking. In C. elegans, BBS-2 is 
  required for proper BBSome assembly and its ciliary localization. The BBSome 
  functions as a scaffold to assemble IFT (intraflagellar transport) particles 
  at both the ciliary base and tip, regulating IFT assembly and turnaround. 
  BBS-2 localizes to the cilium, ciliary basal body, and ciliary axoneme, and is
  expressed exclusively in ciliated sensory neurons including amphid and phasmid
  neurons. Loss of BBS-2 function results in defective cilia structure, 
  compromised IFT, and dye-filling defects. BBS-2 is an ortholog of human BBS2, 
  mutations in which cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a ciliopathy characterized by 
  retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal malformations, and learning 
  disabilities.

      summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from mouse and 
        other orthologs. In C. elegans, BBS-2 is expressed in ciliated sensory 
        neurons (PMID:14520415, PMID:15231740). The protein is present in the 
        cilia of amphid and phasmid neurons, which are neuronal projections 
        specialized for sensory function.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: BBS-2 localizes to sensory neuron projections (cilia) in C. 
        elegans. This annotation is consistent with direct experimental evidence
        from PMID:14520415 showing expression in amphid and phasmid neurons. 
        While 'cilium' would be more precise, neuron projection is an accurate 
        parent term for sensory cilia that emerge from neuronal dendrites.

      reason: While the BBSome is involved in membrane protein trafficking to

      action: MODIFY
      reason: C. elegans cilia are sensory (non-motile) cilia, not motile cilia.
        The organism lacks motile cilia entirely - its sensory neurons have 
        non-motile cilia specialized for chemosensation, mechanosensation, and 
        thermosensation. The IBA inference from mouse orthologs (which can be in
        motile cilia in some contexts) does not apply to worm biology. This

      - statement: All C. elegans BBS homologs are expressed exclusively in 
          ciliated sensory neurons
        supporting_text: all available Caenorhabditis elegans BBS homologues are
          expressed exclusively in ciliated neurons
      - statement: BBS genes contain RFX regulatory elements associated with 
          ciliogenesis
        supporting_text: contain regulatory elements for RFX, a transcription 
          factor that modulates the expression of genes associated with 
          ciliogenesis and intraflagellar transport
      - statement: Basal body dysfunction is the likely cause of BBS phenotypes
        supporting_text: BBS is probably caused by a defect at the basal body of
          ciliated cells

    title: Loss of C. elegans BBS-7 and BBS-8 protein function results in cilia 
      defects and compromised intraflagellar transport.
    findings:
      - statement: BBS proteins localize predominantly at the base of cilia
        supporting_text: C. elegans BBS proteins localize predominantly at the 
          base of cilia
      - statement: BBS proteins move bidirectionally along the ciliary axoneme 
          like IFT proteins
        supporting_text: like proteins involved in intraflagellar transport 
          (IFT), a process necessary for cilia biogenesis and maintenance, move 
          bidirectionally along the ciliary axoneme
      - statement: BBS-7 and BBS-8 are required for normal IFT protein 
          localization and motility
        supporting_text: BBS-7 and BBS-8 are required for the normal 
          localization/motility of the IFT proteins OSM-5/Polaris and CHE-11
      - statement: Loss of BBS function causes structural and functional cilia 
          defects

          genes cause structural and functional defects in cilia

    title: The BBSome controls IFT assembly and turnaround in cilia.
    findings:
      - statement: The BBSome assembles IFT complexes at the ciliary base
        supporting_text: the BBSome (refs 3, 4), a group of conserved proteins 
          affected in human Bardet-Biedl syndrome(5) (BBS), assembles IFT 
          complexes at the ciliary base
      - statement: The BBSome binds to IFT particles as cargo, not as a 
          structural component
        supporting_text: After IFT particles are assembled at the ciliary base, 
          the BBSome binds to the IFT particle like a cargo but not a structural
          component
      - statement: BBSome is required for IFT particle reassembly and turnaround
          at ciliary tip
        supporting_text: the BBSome is required for assembling IFT particles at 
          both ciliary base and tip
      - statement: BBS-2 shows ciliary localization and IFT movement
        supporting_text: the others (BBS-2, -5, -7, -8, -9) only showed very dim
          ciliary staining when compared to wild-type animals
      - statement: BiFC assays confirm BBS proteins form a complex in C. elegans
        supporting_text: "In wild-type animals, fluorescence complementation can be
          observed in BBS-1–BBS-7 and BBS-1–BBS-9 pair, indicative of the coexistence
          of these three BBS proteins in the same complex"
      - statement: Loss of BBSome-IFT coupling leads to IFT-B accumulation at 
          ciliary tips
        supporting_text: The absence of the BBSome at the cilia tip leads to the
          defective recycling of IFT complex

core_functions:
  - description: BBS-2 functions as a core structural component of the BBSome 
      complex, contributing to intraciliary transport (IFT) assembly and 
      turnaround at both the ciliary base and tip in sensory neurons. The BBSome
      acts as a scaffold organizing IFT-A, IFT-B, and cargo molecules.
