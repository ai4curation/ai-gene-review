description: MKSR-2 (MKS1-related protein 2) is a B9 domain-containing protein 
  that functions as a component of the MKS (Meckel syndrome) module at the 
  ciliary transition zone. It is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian B9D2. 
  MKSR-2 forms a complex with MKS-1 and MKSR-1 and localizes specifically to the
  transition zone/basal body of sensory cilia. The protein functions redundantly
  with nephrocystins (NPHP-1, NPHP-4) to regulate cilia formation and 
  maintenance in amphid and phasmid ciliated sensory neurons. The MKS module, 
  together with the NPHP module, establishes basal body/ transition zone 
  membrane attachments and a ciliary gate that restricts entry of non-ciliary 
  components. Loss of mksr-2 in combination with other MKS/NPHP pathway 
  mutations leads to ciliogenesis defects and altered lifespan via abnormal 
  insulin-IGF-I signaling.

    review:
      summary: MKSR-2 is a core component of the MKS complex at the ciliary 
        transition zone. The B9 proteins (MKS-1, MKSR-1, MKSR-2) form a complex 
        that localizes to the base of cilia and functions as part of the MKS 
        module (PMID:18337471, PMID:21422230).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a well-established core function of MKSR-2. Multiple 
        studies demonstrate that the B9 proteins including MKSR-2 form the MKS 
        complex and function together at the transition zone. IBA annotation 
        from phylogenetic analysis is consistent with experimental data.

          attachments before or coinciding with intraflagellar 
          transport-dependent axoneme extension and subsequently restrict 
          accumulation of nonciliary components within the ciliary compartment

    description: MKSR-2 is a core structural component of the MKS (Meckel 
      syndrome) complex, forming a trimeric complex with MKS-1 and MKSR-1 (the 
      three B9 domain proteins). This complex localizes to the ciliary 
      transition zone where it functions as part of the ciliary gate machinery.

          NPHP-4 proteins exhibit essential, collective functions at the

suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the precise molecular mechanism by which MKSR-2 
      contributes to ciliary gate function?
  - question: Does MKSR-2 directly interact with membrane components at the 
      transition zone or function through other adaptor proteins?
  - question: What are the specific cargo proteins whose localization is 
      regulated by MKSR-2?
suggested_experiments:
  - description: Proximity labeling (BioID/TurboID) to identify direct 
      interaction partners of MKSR-2 at the transition zone
    hypothesis: MKSR-2 interacts with specific membrane and cytoskeletal 
      proteins to anchor the MKS complex at the transition zone
  - description: Structure-function analysis to determine which domains are 
      required for localization vs complex formation vs gate function
    hypothesis: The B9 domain mediates complex formation while other regions 
      control membrane association
  - description: Systematic analysis of ciliary protein localization in mksr-2 
      mutants to identify cargo affected by loss of gate function
    hypothesis: Loss of MKSR-2 results in abnormal accumulation or exclusion of 
      specific ciliary membrane proteins
