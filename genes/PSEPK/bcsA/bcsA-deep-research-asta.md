## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88JL4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cellulose synthase catalytic subunit [UDP-forming] {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00018714, ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU365020}; EC=2.4.1.12 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00012539, ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU365020};
- **Gene Information:** Name=bcsA {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68243.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_2635 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68243.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 2 family.
- **Key Domains:** Cell_synth_A. (IPR003919); Glyco_trans_2-like. (IPR001173); Glycosyltr_2/OpgH_subfam. (IPR050321); Nucleotide-diphossugar_trans. (IPR029044); PilZ_domain. (IPR009875)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "bcsA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'bcsA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **bcsA** (gene ID: bcsA, UniProt: Q88JL4) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > gene_input Mandatory fields are 'gene_name', 'uniprot', 'hgnc_symbol' and 'ensembl'. This file is critical for establishing the link between the scRNA-seq data and the interaction pairs stored at the protein level. It includes the following gene and protein identifiers: (i) gene name ('gene_name'), (ii) UniProt identifier ('uniprot'), (iii) HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbol ('hgnc_symbol') and (iv) gene Ensembl identifier (ENSG) ('ensembl'). To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > The BLASTx homology search tool, a component of the standalone NCBI-blast-2.3.0+, was used to perform functional annotation of the F. udum genes (Altschul et al., 1990). With a cut-off E value of ≤1e−06 and a similarity of 34%, BLASTx identified the homologous sequences of the genes in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using Blast2GO PRO 4.1.5 (Conesa and Gotz, 2008). In three different mappings, B2G performed as follows: (1) Using two NCBI-provided mapping files, blast result accessions are used to get gene names (symbols; gene info, gene 2 accessions). (2) Blast result GI identifiers were used to retrieve UniProt IDs using a mapping file from PIR (non-redundant reference protein database), which includes PSD, Swiss-Prot, UniProt, TrEMBL, GenPept, RefSeq, and PDB. The names of the identified genes were searched in the species-specific entries of the gene product table of the GO database. With the aid of the KAAS-KEGG Automatic Annotation Server, pathway analyses were carried out. This database provides functional annotation of genes using other data servers (Moriya et al., 2007). Accessions from the blast results were looked for in the DBXRef table of the GO database.

    > SummaryCellulose, an aggregate of unbranched polymers of β-1,4-linked glucose residues, is the major component of wood and thus paper, and is synthesized by plants, most algae, some bacteria and fungi, and even some animals. The genes that synthesize cellulose in higher plants differ greatly from the well-characterized genes found in Acetobacter and Agrobacterium sp. More correctly designated as 'cellulose synthase catalytic subunits', plant cellulose synthase (CesA) proteins are integral membrane proteins, approximately 1,000 amino acids in length. The sequences for more than 20 full-length CesA genes are available, and they show high similarity to one another across the entire length of the encoded protein, except for two small regions of variability. There are a number of highly conserved residues, including several motifs shown to be necessary for processive glycosyltransferase activity. No crystal structure is known for cellulose synthase proteins, and the exact enzymatic mechanism is unknown. There are a number of mutations in cellulose synthase genes in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Some of these mutants show altered morphology due to the lack of a properly developed primary or secondary cell wall. Others show resistance to well-characterized cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > One major concern regarding genome data is the potential spread of false or inaccurate functional annotations iterating by sequence similarity-based gene annotations where functions are ascribed by analogy to other organisms' genes rather than being experimentally verified. As the source of information on a putative gene function is not always clearly indicated in databases, we advise researchers to always trace the original literature related to a gene function to verify its plausibility in a given non-model organism.
    > A special case is the genes with no known functional annotation in model organisms, like the y-genes in E. coli (so named because their gene names begin with the letter y). Ghatak et al. (2019) used multiple databases to define the y-ome of E. coli as the 35% genes that lack experimental evidence of their function, and highlight the differences between genes that lack any known function and those with attributed localization or computationally annotated functional domains. A similar situation is observed with eukaryotic genomes, where a consistent fraction of about 20% of the genes remains with unknown (or unstudied) gene products. Wood et al. (2019) compared unknown gene products of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, S. cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens, and concluded that these genes remained understudied even since genome sequences were published. They disprove the common assumption that unknown gene products are mostly orphaned, as the majority are conserved from yeasts to humans, and they conclude that the reasons for the lack of research on these proteins is two-fold. For many of these genes, no apparent knockout phenotype was observed in standard conditions. On the other hand, researchers still focus on a few well-studied proteins rather than exploring unknown territories, which the authors partly ascribe to risk-adverse strategies of funders and reviewers.
    > Although the primary use of metabolic models is the analysis of already known metabolic pathways, the potential of metabolic models extends far beyond these analyses. They can be used to uncover hidden pathways, unknown reactions, and to construct de novo pathways.

The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.

Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions.

    > To obtain functional information, gene annotation including homologous protein annotation was performed using gene ontology(GO)and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) database. All-unigenes sequences were first blasted using BLASTx against the non-redundant NCBI nucleotide database using a cut-off E-value of 10 25 . The protein functions were predicted from the annotations with the most homologous proteins using the Uniprot and SwissProt database. 9502 annotated uniGenes were obtained by this method. The species distribution among the top hits showed that 19.22% annotated sequences matched with Schizosaccharomyces pombe (strain 972/ATCC 24843), followed by Candida albicans (strain SC5314/ATCC MYA-2876) (15.17%), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508/S288c) (11.05%), Arabidopsis thaliana (7.66%), Dictyostelium discoideum (4.17%) as shown in Figure 4.
    > Gene Ontology(GO)is an international standardized gene functional classification system, which fully describes the properties  of genes and gene products in an organism. GO was analyzed using Blast2go software (http://www.blast2go.com/b2ghome).
    > Based on sequence homology, those sequences were categorized into functional groups including ''Biological process'' (a total of 5279 sequences), ''Cellular component'' (altogether 5132 sequences) and ''Molecular function'' (5032 sequences in total, see Figure 5). Among these three main categories, 'Cellular progress', 'Cytosol' and 'Protein binding' were the three major subcategories. A high percentage of genes came from categories of 'Metabolic process', 'Regulation of growth rate', 'Cytoplasmic part', 'Catalytic', and 'ATP binding'. To further identify the different gene expression levels during fermentation (WT vs. HY), the GO functional analysis was carried out on the differentially expressed genes (Figure 6).

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

    > GPR relationships specify the putative relationship between genes and enzymatic activities in an organism. Following previous work [52], we represented these relationships as Boolean statements. The simplest such statement was: gene A implies reaction X, i.e., gene A -> reaction X. Enzymatic activities associated with protein complexes required more complicated statements, e.g., (gene A or gene B) and (gene C) -> reaction X.
    > To develop the GPR relationships for C. thermocellum, we used the annotations described above and information on protein complexes from UniProt. For each EC number in the C. thermocellum annotations, we searched UniProt [23] to determine whether that EC is associated with protein complexes, and if so, what type of complex exists across different organisms (homodimer, heterotrimer, etc.). Based on this information, and the information in the annotations, we assigned putative GPR relationships for C. thermocellum, conforming to known enzyme complex architecture whenever possible. As a specific example of this process, consider the reaction corresponding to carbamoyl-phosphate synthase ('R_CBPS'), EC 6.3.5.5. Several UniProt entries (e.g., CARA_ECOLI) with this EC number are annotated as being members of a complex composed of two chains, a small glutamine-hydrolyzing chain and a large chain that synthesizes carbamoyl phosphate. We found two C. thermocellum genes annotated as "carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, small subunit" (Cthe_1867, Cthe_0950) and two genes annotated as "carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, large subunit" (Cthe_1868, Cthe_0949). Thus, we expressed the GPR relationship for this reaction as: (Cthe_1867 or Cthe_0950) and (Cthe_1868 or Cthe_0949) -> R_CBPS.

    > Whole-genome sequencing has enabled investigations into the gene content of living many organisms and forms the foundation for further study of gene expression, proteomics and epigenetics. After assembly of a novel genome, gene annotation is often the first step in analysing the gene content of an organism. Accurate annotation of the exonic structure of genes is crucial to the success of all subsequent functional and comparative analyses.
    > Problems that can potentially be caused by incorrect gene annotation are numerous and can lead to incorrect assessments of the lifestyle and ecology of an organism. In comparative genomics where orthologous genes or conserved functional domains are compared between species/isolates, the estimated numbers of such genes/ domains can be distorted by less than perfect annotations (as described by Hane et al. [1], S Text 1). Prediction of extracellular secretion, which can be determined by a short signal peptide at the N-terminus, can miss secreted proteins if the start codon of a gene has been incorrectly annotated. Mis-annotating the start of protein translation could either cut off the signal peptide or bury it within the annotation. While a seemingly benign annotation error, the consequences for downstream research could be detrimental, particularly as the biotic interactions or industrial applications of microbes are largely determined by their secretomes. Additionally, translated protein sequences of novel species are often submitted to databases such as NCBI [2] and Uniprot [3]. It is commonplace to use these database entries to support the annotation of related species or isolates, meaning errors present in the pioneer annotation may be repeated. When these new annotations based on false assumptions are added to databases, there is not only a propagation of errors, but also a perceived strengthening of homology evidence for incorrect protein sequences.
    > In recent years, correction of in silico predicted gene annotations with RNA-seq derived transcripts and read alignments has enabled vastly improved genome annotations and corrections of annotated gene structures [4][5][6].

    > Gene annotation was primarily derived from the S. clavuligerus reference genome in the NCBI database and was annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline 59 . However, several CA biosynthetic genes were manually corrected based on published literature 9 . For instance, two loci were originally annotated as clavaminate synthase 1 (cas1), but one of these loci is located near the cephamycin C biosynthetic cluster, indicating it was actually cas2. Following this correction, the RefSeq accession numbers of all genes in the reference genome were cross-referenced with the UniProt database to obtain additional annotations 60 . For the mutated genes identified through ICA, protein existence levels were manually assigned based on the UniProt data, including protein existence status, annotation score, similar proteins, and relevant publications.

    > The E. coli K-12 Reference Proteome and Data Sources-Two databases Uniprot (29) and EcoLOCATION (32) and the proposed IM proteome (33) were the main initial starting points for the complete subcellular categorization of K-12 described here. The E. coli K-12/ MG1655 strain is one of the microbial proteomes whose comprehensive annotation is of the highest priority in Uniprot (29). This is the "reference proteome" for E. coli, contains 4303 proteins, and has been annotated here. Our annotation has been formulated in such a way that it can be easily incorporated in Uniprot.
    > EchoLOCATION has an easily accessible table that maps gene names to subcellular locations. However, mapping the gene names given by EchoLOCATION to the respective protein identifiers in Uniprot was not straightforward. Unfortunately, gene names cannot serve as unique identifiers of a protein sequence. In more than 100 cases the gene name of a predicted protein in EchoLOCATION when searched against Uniprot gave as a result more than one K-12 protein hits. That is because there are proteins that have common synonymous gene names with the primary gene name of others.
    > To retrieve updated Uniprot accession identifiers and to map Uniprot accessions identifiers to EchoLOCATION identifiers (termed: EchoBASE IDs) we used the "ID mapping" function of Uniprot. In cases where the only provided identifiers were the gene names, we used mySQL queries to compare with the primary and alternative gene names in Uniprot. In cases where multiple matches existed for the same gene name, we manually resolved the differences based on other information (e.g. protein description, mass etc.).
    > The annotation of pseudogenes, mobile elements, transposons, and insertion elements relied on EcoGene (34), Uniprot (29), and Ochman et al. (35). The list of E. coli K-12 complexes was retrieved from EcoCyc (31) and literature searches.
