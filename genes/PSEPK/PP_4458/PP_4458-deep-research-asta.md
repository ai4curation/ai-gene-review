## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88EK4
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Opine ABC transporter, periplasmic binding protein {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70033.1};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_4458 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70033.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 5 family.
- **Key Domains:** Peptide/Ni-bd. (IPR030678); SBP_5. (IPR039424); SBP_5_dom. (IPR000914); SBP_bac_5 (PF00496)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_4458" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_4458' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_4458** (gene ID: PP_4458, UniProt: Q88EK4) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > In addition to the systematic experimental verification of novel annotations in three GO categories as described above, here we highlight individual predictions for which we found supporting evidence in the publicly available databases. This information was not available to the classifiers at the time when the models were constructed. The following examples are for E. coli K12, as this is by far the best-studied model prokaryote [21].
    > We predict genes hypC and hybG to have ''nickel cation binding.'' These genes had no GO terms assigned in the 07-02-2012 UniProt-GOA release (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/ P0AAM3 and http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0AAM7), and we therefore considered them unannotated. In the meantime, hypC was annotated with ''metal ion binding'' using experimental evidence: this is a parent GO term of our prediction. Moreover, when examining the literature, we found evidence that these two genes are involved in the biosynthesis of the [NiFe] cluster [22].
    > Another prediction is for gltL: we predicted it is annotated with ''ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complex.'' In line with our predictions, PortEco, a portal that includes information from 14 different E. coli data resources [23], labels the gene as ''ATPbinding component of ABC superfamily.'' Note that more general electronic GO annotations were available for this gene, e.g. ''ATP binding,'' ''ATPase activity,'' and ''ATP catabolic process'' (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0AAG3).
    > A similar prediction of a more detailed function is for ybgI, where we predict GO terms from both BP and MF ontologies. This gene is known to be a conserved metal-binding protein [24], having an electronic GO annotation ''metal ion binding''; we predict it is annotated with the BP GO term ''Mo-molybdopterin cofactor metabolic process.''

    > Sequence similarity analyses were accomplished using blastx [26] against the NCBI non-redundant database on protein level [32], the Swissprot database [33,34] and KEGG [35]. Additionally, manual gene annotation was performed using PRIAM [36], Motif Scan [37], Prosite  [38], BRENDA [39,40], UniProt/SwissProt [34], Inter-ProScan [41], and Pfam [42] databases. One example of how our manual annotation differed from that of the automated pipeline used by Brown et al. can be found in the case of CLAU_3519 (CAETHG_3609). Here the automated pipeline from the Brown et al. finished genome assigned this gene product as a hypothetical protein, however when the sequence was aligned using BLASTP as part of our manual curation all other proteins with >75 % identity were named sodium ABC transporter. Upon further inspection in Pfam, one large ABC-2 family transporter protein domain was found (E-value 6.8e-31). Similar searches of UniProt and KEGG databases agreed with Pfam, therefore we annotated this gene product as an ABC-2 family transporter. The correction of the previously short-called homopolymer reads through our sequencing efforts gave a fully annotated finished sequence of C. autoethanogenum without the erroneous frame-shift containing annotations which had occurred previously. Using these tools we were able to manually curate the entire genome to ensure that the automated annotation was correct and to insert additional information where required, as well as implementing a standardised protein product naming system as recommend by the NCBI guidelines [43] for ease of identification of genes with related functions. As a consequence of the automated and subsequent manual curation, we have found 482 instances across the genome where genes previously identified as 'hypothetical protein' have either been assigned a specific function, or have been named through identification of conserved domains based on sequence similarity.

    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > The proteins identified as a result of LC-MS/MS analysis were evaluated in UniProt and the names and functions of the proteins are given as an appendix. Here, 6 protein-coding genes in the bands of the proteins released into the medium by the co-culture were found in the S.pombe genome and were classified according to their biological functions and cellular locations using the online platform PANTHER (Figure 2). Other 257 protein-coding genes were found in the E. coli genome. These proteins were also classified according to their cellular location (Figure 3) and their cellular functions (Figure 4). Maltose/maltodextrin-binding periplasmic protein (malE) and D-galactose-binding periplasmic protein (mglB) found in E. coli cells are among the binding proteins found in LC-MS-MS results. The binding protein MglB has a high affinity for glucose (Ferenci, 1996), and at low glucose concentration, glucose is mainly taken up by cells in this way. In a study by Egli et al. (1993), giving 1.8 mg l−1 galactose to a low glucose-containing E. coli culture decreased the glucose utilization of the cells and led to glucose accumulation in continuous culture. In addition, Hua and., (2004) found that the expression of a series of genes encoding membrane transporter proteins was significantly induced in cultures of limited chemostats for various carbon sources, and that about half of these genes were maltose (all genes of malGFE and malK-lamB-malM operons), galactose. They showed that there are genes involved in a wide variety of high-affinity ABC transport systems that facilitate uptake (three genes of the mglBAC operon). In E. coli, the ABC transporter gene family covers approximately 5% of the entire genome (Linton and Higgins, 1998). This shows how important these genes are. Carbon-limited cultures have been proposed to investigate bacterial growth and behavior under environmental conditions (Matin, 1979;Moriarty, 1993;Morita, 1993).

    > Background Although a large set of full-length transcripts was recently assembled in catfish, annotation of large gene families, especially those with duplications, is still a great challenge. Most often, complexities in annotation cause mis-identification and thereby much confusion in the scientific literature. As such, detailed phylogenetic analysis and/or orthology analysis are required for annotation of genes involved in gene families. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene superfamily is a large gene family that encodes membrane proteins that transport a diverse set of substrates across membranes, playing important roles in protecting organisms from diverse environment. Methodology/Principal Findings In this work, we identified a set of 50 ABC transporters in catfish genome. Phylogenetic analysis allowed their identification and annotation into seven subfamilies, including 9 ABCA genes, 12 ABCB genes, 12 ABCC genes, 5 ABCD genes, 2 ABCE genes, 4 ABCF genes and 6 ABCG genes. Most ABC transporters are conserved among vertebrates, though cases of recent gene duplications and gene losses do exist. Gene duplications in catfish were found for ABCA1, ABCB3, ABCB6, ABCC5, ABCD3, ABCE1, ABCF2 and ABCG2. Conclusion/Significance The whole set of catfish ABC transporters provide the essential genomic resources for future biochemical, toxicological and physiological studies of ABC drug efflux transporters. The establishment of orthologies should allow functional inferences with the information from model species, though the function of lineage-specific genes can be distinct because of specific living environment with different selection pressure.

    > Protein identifications with 2 peptides and a confident protein score (P <0.05) from the HpH fractionation and IDA-MS were used to assign subcellular localization. Using the top score given by WoLF PSORT [10] (www.genscript.com/wolf-psort.html) proteins were categorized into 8 locations. Membrane proteins were predicted using transmembrane helical Markov model (TMHMM) [11] (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Proteins in the solute carrier protein (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter families were identified according to gene and protein name. We also used website gene names (www.genenames.org/data) to characterise the subcellular location of the transporter and the type of substrate they transport.
    > For proteins annotated as 'uncharacterised' in figures and tables in the manuscript a BLAST protein homology search was carried out using the Ensembl or uniport accession code in uniprotKB (www.uniprot.org). The accession code page contains the sequence and a link to BLAST. BLASTp results against uniprotkb_Swissprot reference proteomes and an identity sequence match of >95.5% to human, bovine (cattle) or caprine (goat) proteome annotation was accepted as the protein name.

    > To obtain comprehensive gene function information, we performed gene function annotation using eight major databases, including UniProt [23], KEGG [24] and KEGG Pathway, GO [25], Pfam [26], COG [27], TIGERfams [28], RefSeq, and NR. The predicted gene sequences were aligned against functional databases such as COG, KEGG, UniProt, and RefSeq using BLAST+ (Version: 2.11.0+), resulting in the gene function annotation outcomes. The statistical results of the annotations are shown in Table S2. Among the top 20 domains annotated based on Pfam, we observed that genes belonging to "ABC transporters" were the most abundant (Figure 2A). As we know, ABC transporters comprise a large superfamily of proteins that facilitate the translocation of a diverse array of substrates, including ions and macromolecules, across cellular membranes through ATP binding and hydrolysis. Furthermore, these transporters are also critically involved in the cellular uptake and efflux of numerous organic pollutants [29,30]. These results suggest that the abundance of ABC transporter genes provides Paracoccus sp. P-2 with a significant capacity for deltamethrin transport. As shown in Figure 2B, the genes annotated by KEGG are divided into 5 major categories and 23 minor subcategories. Among them, the subcategory with the largest number of genes is metabolic pathways, which include amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, among others. The abundance of genes related to metabolic pathways provides the fundamental basis for the survival and deltamethrin degradation capability of Paracoccus sp. P-2. It is worth noting that a substantial number (254) of membrane transporter genes have been annotated in the genome of Paracoccus sp. P-2. Pollutants are often adsorbed onto the microbial membrane surface and subsequently internalized into the cells-a process in which membrane transporter proteins play a crucial role [31]. This abundance of transporter genes highlights the strain's strong capacity for pollutant transport.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].
