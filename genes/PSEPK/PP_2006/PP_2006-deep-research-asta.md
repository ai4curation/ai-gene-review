## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88LC9
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Protein OrfX2/OrfX3/P47 domain-containing protein {ECO:0000259|Pfam:PF06597};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_2006 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN67620.2};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the TULIP P47 family.
- **Key Domains:** OrfX2/OrfX3/P47. (IPR010567); OrfX-like (PF06597)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_2006" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_2006' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_2006** (gene ID: PP_2006, UniProt: Q88LC9) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

### [2] CRONOS: the cross-reference navigation server
- Authors: Brigitte Waegele, I. Dunger, G. Fobo, Corinna Montrone, H. Mewes et al.

- Summary: CRONOS, a cross-reference server that contains entries from five mammalian organisms presented by major gene and protein information resources, is developed, which shows that the cross-references are highly accurate.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.791)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.
  - Snippet 2 (score: 0.721)
    > To avoid mapping errors, we created lists with ambiguous gene names. These lists were manually revised and contain approximately 1900 terms for H.sapiens. Analysis of These lists are invaluable for bioinformatics applications like text mining. Generation of protein-protein interaction networks using gene names leads to a considerable number of false positive interactions if ambiguous gene names are not removed.
    > Mapping of gene names and protein names is conceptually the core of CRONOS. UniProt, RefSeq and Ensembl provide links to a variety of other resources which allows to include additional identifiers for mapping. Thus, the user might enter Agilent microarray identifiers provided by Ensembl in order to obtain UniProt identifiers. This allows mapping of all over-expressed cDNAs from a microarray experiment easily to another format. Beside gene and protein names, CRONOS offers to search with 18 different identifier types. Conversion of lists of IDs into other database-IDs can be done via batch submission. The results are sent via e-mail in a comma separated value (csv) file. Web services were implemented for fully automated access (Supplementary Material S5).
    > Result pages in CRONOS contain mapping relevant information for UniProt, RefSeq, Ensembl and, if available, OMIM (McKusick, 2007). Additional information like protein domains, pathways and functional annotation is also provided.
    > In conclusion, CRONOS allows easy access to cross-references of major resources. Manually curated lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are provided.

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.784)
    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > The protein sequences were functionally annotated by combining information retrieved from the UniProt database ( [25], accessed on 9 June 2022) and one-to-one fast orthology assignments using the eggNOG-mapper v.2.1.7 tool ( [26], accessed on 9 June 2022), as described in [27]. Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > The first inspection of a gene list typically is to link the gene names to what is known, predicted and published about these genes, both in terms of the function of the gene (product), the protein family or protein domains that the gene codes for, and the signal transduction pathways in which it participates. For model species and other species for which the full genomic sequence is available, repositories exist that combine several sources of information on individual genes (for example, see "www.nature.com/scitable/content/ Genomics-Databases-744357" for a list of species-specific repositories [12]). The annotation of genes is mostly following a controlled vocabulary or restricted terminology. For functional annotations, Gene Ontology (GO) is a widely used vocabulary. Gene Ontology describes the genes and their products (e.g., the proteins for which a gene codes) within three main Ontology domains: Molecular Function, Biological Process and Cellular Component. Genes can be described at various hierarchical levels using this GO terminology, ranging from broad over-arching themes to very specific descriptions. Descriptions of protein domains are often inferred based on sequence similarity to other organism, for example using the InterPro terminology. Since many proteins are involved in several biological processes or contain more than one functional domain, genes (or gene products) have often different GO annotations across the three GO domains and different IP annotations (Table 1).  1. Examples of gene annotations, using the vocabulary of the Gene Ontology (GO) and InterPro (IP). Annotations are provided for three genes that were differentially expressed during the immune response of Drosophila after infection by parasites [5]. The GO annotations describe the function and process that have been reported for the protein, and the IP annotations describe the protein domains.
    > Genes that are involved in different processes, or coding for proteins with multiple functional domains, may contain a variety of annotations. Many genes, however, are not fully annotated.

Additionally a mixture of several identifier types is possible. In the first step user supplied gene Ids are mapped to 'Entrez Gene' identifiers. For this purpose files from NCBI and Affymetrix web sites are used. Detailed information on data sources used by GeneSet2miRNA is in Table 1.

We would like to point out that protein and gene identifiers can be highly ambiguous (29) with multiple synonymous variants. For this reason the quality of the retrieved annotation can be different for different types of identifiers. To escape multiple mapping issues we recommend submitting 'Entrez Gene' identifies to GeneSet2miRNA.

Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

Yet, many of these genes/proteins remained not well-understood in relation to the observed phenotype. The major gap to our full understanding stems from our lack in complete gene/protein functions which, in turn, impedes researchers from assembling the sets of biomolecular mechanisms that can sufficiently explain the observed phenotype in these OMICs experiments; the knowledge of gene/protein functions is a premise necessary for delivering the big promises in personalized medicine.
    > Despite so, experimental characterization of gene/protein function still receives insufficient attention nowadays. This can be attested by the dwindling number of characterized genes/proteins reported over the past decade. Sadly, one can expect this number to continue to grow at a slow rate.
    > On this basis, the only viable approach is to computationally transfer function annotation of the well-studied gene/ protein sequences to the less-studied or novel ones for functional hints. Implicitly, this entails that these in-silico function annotations must always be kept consistent regardless of the revisions made to function annotation databases or associated software tools used during the computations.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > UniProt contains two types of entries: reviewed and unreviewed. The reviewed entries are curated by domain experts with information extracted from literature and curator-evaluated computational analysis and are assumed to be of high quality. Proteins and gene names in the reviewed entries include recommended name and synonyms from the literature and nomenclature standards, plus locus names and open reading frame names (ORFs) for gene names. The unreviewed entries, on the other hand, contain protein sequences (e.g., from translation of sequences in GenBank [30]) associated with computationally generated annotation and large-scale functional characterization. These entries have not been curated by human annotators. Protein and gene names in unreviewed entries come from direct submissions, propagation of annotation rules developed by UniProt, or other external sources. UniProt coverage for plant proteins in the reviewed section is limited; as an example there are only 446 entries for tomato proteins in the reviewed part, but 37,386 entries from this species in the unreviewed part. Thus, we also considered including gene and protein names from unreviewed entries in UniProt. A quick analysis of some unreviewed entries suggested that while the gene names were acceptable, the protein names should be used with caution because they are often very general. For example, in the unreviewed entry UniProt AC B6SS10, the Submitted (protein) full name is "Receptor kinase". Using such names would lead to too many non-specific matches. As discussed above, the fact that the name ends with an f-term indicates that it is likely to be a generic name description rather than a specific name. Thus, from the unreviewed entries, we extract all gene names and only those protein names that include c-terms.

    > gene_input Mandatory fields are 'gene_name', 'uniprot', 'hgnc_symbol' and 'ensembl'. This file is critical for establishing the link between the scRNA-seq data and the interaction pairs stored at the protein level. It includes the following gene and protein identifiers: (i) gene name ('gene_name'), (ii) UniProt identifier ('uniprot'), (iii) HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbol ('hgnc_symbol') and (iv) gene Ensembl identifier (ENSG) ('ensembl'). To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

    > 2.1. Phylogenetic Distribution of orfX1, orfX2, orfX3, and p47 in Bacteria
    > The BoNT gene cluster frequently harbors orfX1, orfX2, orfX3, and p47 in BoNT-producing Clostridia. While the ha operon has been exclusively linked to BoNT gene clusters of Clostridia, the orfX1-3 operon and p47 have also been found in BoNT gene clusters of phylogenetically more distant species, such as Enterococcus faecium [21]. We hypothesized that orfX1-3 and p47 may be found in a wider range of bacterial species. As OrfX2, OrfX3, and P47 belong to the Clostridium P47 superfamily (Pfam ID: PF06597), we searched for the PF06597 domain using the online web tool Annotree (Figure 1). Bacterial species belonging to 23 different orders, such as Bacteroidales, Rhizobiales, or Streptomycetales, were identified as encoding Clostridium P47 superfamily proteins. As Annotree includes only representative genomes and thus omits intraspecies genomic diversity, it is possible that the analysis does not fully reflect the true phylogenetic distribution of the superfamily PF06597. Therefore, it is likely that proteins belonging to the Clostridium P47 superfamily are present even in a larger number of taxonomic orders or families. This is in contrast with the phylogenetic distribution of BoNT and BoNT-like proteins, suggesting that the biological function of Clostridium P47 superfamily proteins is not exclusively associated with BoNT. Further evidence supporting this hypothesis is discussed below. putatively encode components of a tripartite toxin complex. This finding suggests that the truncated BoNT/NTNH-like protein detected in a Bacillus isolate may display a mode of action and host specificity different from canonical BoNTs. Together, the present work reveals new insights into the biological roles of OrfX1, OrfX2, OrfX3, and P47 in bacterial toxinogenesis and pathogenesis.

    > Further the assembled transcript contigs were validated using CLC Genomics workbench (CLC Bio, Boston, MA 02108 USA) by mapping high quality reads back to the assembled transcript contigs. ORF-Predictor [57], an online tool, was used on default parameters to identify the coding DNA sequences (CDS) from assembled transcript contigs. GC counts of transcripts was determined using a custom-made perl script.
    > Functional annotations. The functional annotation was performed by aligning coding DNA sequence (CDS) to NCBI 'green plant database (txid 33090)' database using basic local alignment search tool (BLASTX) [58] with an E-value threshold of 1e -06 and GO assignments were used to classify the functions of the predicted CDS. The GO mapping also provided ontology of defined terms representing gene product properties which were grouped into three main domains: biological process (BP), molecular function (MF) and cellular component (CC). GO mapping was carried out in order to retrieve GO terms for all the BLASTX functionally annotated CDS. The GO mapping used defined criteria to retrieve GO terms for annotated CDS which included use of BLASTX result accession IDs to retrieve gene names or symbols, UniProt IDs and direct search in the dbxref table of GO database. Identified gene names or symbols were then searched in the species specific entries of the gene-product tables of GO database. UniProt IDs made use of protein information resource (PIR) which includes protein sequence database (PSD), UniProt, SwissProt, TrEMBL, RefSeq, GenPept, and PDB databases. Gene Ontology analysis helps in specifying all the annotated nodes comprising of GO functional groups. CDS were compared against the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) database for the analysis of phylogenetically widespread domain families. CDS were compared against Pfam database for higher-level groupings of related protein families, known as clans and the identification of domains that occurs within proteins. BLASTX was used against uniprot-swissprot database with cut-off e-value 1e-6 to annotate predicted CDS against protein.
