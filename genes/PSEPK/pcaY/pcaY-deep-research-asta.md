## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88JK6
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein PcaY {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=PcaY_PP {ECO:0000303|PubMed:28620365};
- **Gene Information:** Name=pcaY {ECO:0000303|PubMed:12534463}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_2643 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:AAN68251.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the methyl-accepting chemotaxis (MCP) protein
- **Key Domains:** Chemotax_Me-accpt_rcpt. (IPR004090); HAMP_dom. (IPR003660); MCPsignal_dom. (IPR004089); Tar_rcpt_lig-bd. (IPR003122); HAMP (PF00672)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "pcaY" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'pcaY' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **pcaY** (gene ID: pcaY, UniProt: Q88JK6) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

### [3] Construction of an Ortholog Database Using the Semantic Web Technology for Integrative Analysis of Genomic Data

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Gene nomenclature contains current official symbols and various numbers of synonyms, which pose a challenge to integrating genomic data and increase the probability that different genes share the same symbol. Therefore, we retrieved identifiers assigned to all protein-coding genes in human, mouse, rat and pig genomes that are available in the Ensembl genome browser (release 113) to assess the number of genes, compare species and identify ambiguous symbols. Results: Our analysis revealed that the total number of symbols, both official symbols and synonyms, used to identify protein-coding genes ranges from 16,600 in pigs to 64,580 in mice. Furthermore, the gene nomenclature is not complete because there are also genes without an assigned symbol, which indicates gaps in understanding protein-coding genes, especially in pigs. We also found a large number of gene symbols that map to more than one gene. These symbols might complicate the identification of about 10% of rat and mouse genes and 18% of human protein-coding genes. A simple solution for this problem is the usage of stable gene IDs assigned by scientific institutions and committees (Ensembl, NCBI, RGD, HGNC and VGNC) provided that the genomic information associated with these IDs is retrieved directly from proprietary databases containing the most accurate data. Finally, although gene symbols may pose a problem with unequivocal identification of genes, there are instances when no other identifiers are available in the literature. Therefore, we have developed an R script performing search of the Ensembl database and integrating data to provide a single list of updated symbols with annotation about their ambiguity. Conclusions: Gene symbols are not always reliable and should be reported together with stable IDs to enable unequivocal identification of genes. Therefore, data containing only gene symbols should be used cautiously to avoid misidentification of genes. A solution for this problem is our R script REgeness that performs a gene symbol update to current official versions combined with identification of ambiguous symbols and retrieval of other IDs from the Ensembl database.

    > Notably, the mecA gene identified in this functional enrichment analysis is likely the regulatory ClpC adaptor protein found in non-MR S A strains, rather than the resistanceassociated mecA (PBP2a) typically carried on SCC mec elements, as evidenced by its association with GO terms related to regulation (Fig. 3 ). This type of annotation ambiguity is common in large-scale analyses and, in this case, results from the reuse of gene names within a species, two genes both named mecA in S. aureus that are functionally distinct. This is a known limitation of name-based mapping approaches, particularly in bacterial genomes where conserved gene names are often repurposed across strains and functional contexts [69][70][71]. This specific annotation issue has been noted in a previous study [ 72 ].
    > In our GO term enrichment analysis, gene annotation is performed by matching gene names from the input list to the reference genome of S. aureus NCBI Taxonomy ID: 1280. This strain, commonly used in functional genomics tools such as ShinyGO, does not possess the resistance-associated mecA (PBP2a) gene. Currently, ShinyGO only offers two S. aureus reference genomes for selection (NCBI Taxonomy IDs 1280 and 93061), neither of which represent all MR S A strains nor contain the resistance-associated mecA gene (PBP2a). Instead, they contain a gene called mecA annotated as a "conserved hypothetical protein" involved in the recognition and targeting of unfolded and aggregated proteins to the ClpC protease or other components of the proteolytic machinery. This protein is homologous to a competence gene mecA , and thus receives functional annotations based on phylogenetic assignment. As a result, the functional enrichment terms associated with mecA reflect the regulatory and proteostasis roles of this regulatory gene, not β-lactam resistance.
    > This highlights the importance of interpreting functional annotation results with caution, especially in non-model organisms, cases where gene names may be ambiguous, or duplicated across strains.

    > Given a set of predicted protein-coding genes for a newly sequenced genome, functional annotation involves assigning putative functions to the predicted genes. Two ways in which this can be done are assigning protein names and Gene Ontology (GO;Gene Ontology Consortium, 2010) terms to the predicted proteins. Here we describe a computational pipeline for assigning protein names and GO terms to predicted proteins in parasitic worm (nematode and platyhelminth) genomes, which transfers names and GO terms from orthologues in other species.
    > When assigning protein names, UniProt protein naming rules (www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot) are followed where possible. This recommends that a good and stable name for a protein is "as neutral as possible"; that a protein name "should be, as far as possible, unique and attributed to all orthologs"; and a protein name "should not contain a specific characteristic of the protein, and in particular it should not reflect the function or role of the protein, nor its subcellular location, its domain structure, its tissue specificity, its molecular weight or its species of origin".
    > In our protocol, a protein name is assigned to each predicted protein based on curated names in UniProt (Bairoch & Apweiler, 2000) for human, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schistosoma mansoni orthologues identified from a database of gene families (e.g. built using Ensembl Compara; Vilella et al. 2009), or (if no information is found from orthologues) based on InterPro (Hunter et al. 2012) domains. Figure 1 shows an example of using our protein naming pipeline for four Strongyloides ratti genes that belong to the tubulin polyglutamylase family (underlined in pink), where four different protein names were assigned to them (in pink), based on names of their C. elegans or human orthologues.
    > Since each of the S. ratti genes belonged to a different subfamily of the tubulin polyglutamylase family, they were assigned different names.

    > In an effort to engage the collective expertise of the scientific community, we have implemented a collaborative wiki (MediaWiki version 1.19.11) for the Mnemiopsis gene complement. The Mnemiopsis Gene Wiki is accessible from the left sidebar of most pages and is searchable either by selecting a Mnemiopsis gene identifier (e.g., ML00011a) from the drop-down menu or by manually entering an identifier in the appropriate search box. Users can also access these pages by clicking on a gene in the 2.2 track of the genome browser. Each record in the Gene Wiki represents a single Mnemiopsis gene and provides the following annotation: nucleotide and protein sequences, coding exonic genomic coordinates, pre-computed BLAST hits from numerous organisms displaying the top hits for each protein, the top non-self BLAST hit to Mnemiopsis, Pfam-A domains, Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations, human disease genes from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and a table of ortholog clusters formed by phylogenetically informed clustering methods [4] (Figure 5). In addition, controlled editable sections have been included that permit (and encourage) the scientific community to provide further gene annotation for isoforms, in situ images, references, and other notes for each gene. Users interested in supplementing our gene model annotation at the Mnemiopsis Gene Wiki pages must first create an account and log in prior to submitting their contributions. In-house subject matter expert data curators are notified by e-mail following the creation of a new user account or an edit to an existing Gene Wiki record. Any content changes or additions to the Gene Wiki are thoroughly evaluated by these data curators and are made public subject to their approval.
    > Pre-compiled BLAST hits are enumerated in tabular form. Each Mnemiopsis protein was compared to the UniProt and NCBI non-redundant protein databases (nr) using BLASTP. The results display the hit number, the accession numbers, E-values, and brief descriptions of the top four hits (lowest E-values). Accession numbers are linked to relevant corresponding entries at UniProt and GenBank.

Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > The ultimate goal of the functional annotation process (Figure 4) is to assign biologically relevant information to predicted polypeptides, and to the features they derive from (e.g. gene, mRNA). This process is especially relevant nowadays in the context of the NGS era due to the capacity of sequencing, assembling, and annotating full genomes in short periods of time, e.g. less than a month. Functional elements could range from putative name and/or symbols for protein-coding genes, e.g. ADH to its putative biological function, e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase, associated gene ontology terms, e.g. GO:0004022, functional sites, e.g. METAL 47 47 Zinc 1, and domains, e.g. IPR002328, among other features. The function of predicted proteins can be computationally inferred based on the similarity between the sequence of interest and other sequences in different public repositories, e.g. BLASTP against Uniprot. Caution should be taken when assigning results merely based on sequence similarity as two evolutionary independent sequences which share some common domains could be considered homologs 62 . Thus, whenever possible, it is better to use orthologous sequences for annotation purposes rather than simply similar sequences 63 . With the growing number of sequences in those public repositories, it is possible to perform various searches and combine obtained results into a consensus annotation. The accurate assignment of the functional elements is a complex process, and the best annotation will involve manual curation.
    > There are two main outcomes of the functional annotation process. The first is the assignment of functional elements to genes. Downstream analysis of these elements allow further understanding of specific genome properties, e.g. metabolic pathways, and similarities compared with closely related species. The second result of the functional annotation is the additional quality check for the predicted gene set. It is possible to identify problematic and/or suspicious genes by the presence of specific domains, suspicious orthology assignment and/or absence of other functional elements, e.g. functional completeness.

    > The protein set for the CHO midbody was derived from the accession numbers in Table S1 and Table S2 from Skop et al. [9]. Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.
    > The protein set for the HeLa spindle proteome is derived from the 1121 accession numbers in Sauer et al. supplementary table 1 column 2 [17]. Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.

    > The BLASTx homology search tool, a component of the standalone NCBI-blast-2.3.0+, was used to perform functional annotation of the F. udum genes (Altschul et al., 1990). With a cut-off E value of ≤1e−06 and a similarity of 34%, BLASTx identified the homologous sequences of the genes in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using Blast2GO PRO 4.1.5 (Conesa and Gotz, 2008). In three different mappings, B2G performed as follows: (1) Using two NCBI-provided mapping files, blast result accessions are used to get gene names (symbols; gene info, gene 2 accessions). (2) Blast result GI identifiers were used to retrieve UniProt IDs using a mapping file from PIR (non-redundant reference protein database), which includes PSD, Swiss-Prot, UniProt, TrEMBL, GenPept, RefSeq, and PDB. The names of the identified genes were searched in the species-specific entries of the gene product table of the GO database. With the aid of the KAAS-KEGG Automatic Annotation Server, pathway analyses were carried out. This database provides functional annotation of genes using other data servers (Moriya et al., 2007). Accessions from the blast results were looked for in the DBXRef table of the GO database.

    > There are several knowledge bases that represent the collected knowledge of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome: EcoCyc (11), EcoGene (12), UniProt (13) and RefSeq (14). Other useful knowledge bases cater to specific classes of gene products, such as the RegulonDB, which contains manually curated functional information about transcription factors in E. coli (15). Our initial review of these knowledge bases yielded conflicting information on gene function and level of annotation for many E. coli genes. Any attempt to systematically assess the function of unannotated genes must therefore draw from multiple knowledge bases and resolve these conflicts.
    > Many research groups have categorized E. coli genes and proteins by annotation quality as a part of their studies. In 2009, Hu et (16). First, they identified all unannotated proteins in the K-12 W3110 and MG1655 genomes. In order for a protein-encoding gene to be considered functionally uncharacterized in their analysis, it had to meet the following criteria: (i) The gene name begins with 'y', (ii) the gene does not have a known pathway within EcoCyc and (iii) the gene does not have a functional description in Gen-ProtEC (17) (any gene with a description containing the words 'predicted', 'hypothetical', or 'conserved'). Based on these criteria, it was determined that 1431 of 4225 protein coding sequences were not functionally annotated. In 2015, Kim et al. published a database called EcoliNet that curated and predicted cofunctional gene networks for every protein coding gene in the E. coli genome (18). This study also quantified the number of uncharacterized protein coding genes in E. coli. To assess functional annotation, they used the presence of experimentally supported 'biological process' annotations in the Gene Ontology database (19). They concluded that ∼2000 protein coding genes in E. coli were not functionally annotated. The most comprehensive effort to assess the level of annotation in bacterial genomes has been Computational Bridges to Experiments (COM-BREX) (20,21).
