## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88MU7
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Threonine synthase {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00018679, ECO:0000256|NCBIfam:TIGR00260}; EC=4.2.3.1 {ECO:0000256|NCBIfam:TIGR00260};
- **Gene Information:** Name=thrC {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN67093.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_1471 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN67093.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the threonine synthase family.
- **Key Domains:** Ser/Thr_deHydtase_PyrdxlP-BS. (IPR000634); Thr_synth_N. (IPR029144); Thr_synth_N_sf. (IPR037158); Thr_synthase-like. (IPR004450); Threonine_Synthase. (IPR051166)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "thrC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'thrC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **thrC** (gene ID: thrC, UniProt: Q88MU7) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > The ultimate goal of the functional annotation process (Figure 4) is to assign biologically relevant information to predicted polypeptides, and to the features they derive from (e.g. gene, mRNA). This process is especially relevant nowadays in the context of the NGS era due to the capacity of sequencing, assembling, and annotating full genomes in short periods of time, e.g. less than a month. Functional elements could range from putative name and/or symbols for protein-coding genes, e.g. ADH to its putative biological function, e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase, associated gene ontology terms, e.g. GO:0004022, functional sites, e.g. METAL 47 47 Zinc 1, and domains, e.g. IPR002328, among other features. The function of predicted proteins can be computationally inferred based on the similarity between the sequence of interest and other sequences in different public repositories, e.g. BLASTP against Uniprot. Caution should be taken when assigning results merely based on sequence similarity as two evolutionary independent sequences which share some common domains could be considered homologs 62 . Thus, whenever possible, it is better to use orthologous sequences for annotation purposes rather than simply similar sequences 63 . With the growing number of sequences in those public repositories, it is possible to perform various searches and combine obtained results into a consensus annotation. The accurate assignment of the functional elements is a complex process, and the best annotation will involve manual curation.
    > There are two main outcomes of the functional annotation process. The first is the assignment of functional elements to genes. Downstream analysis of these elements allow further understanding of specific genome properties, e.g. metabolic pathways, and similarities compared with closely related species. The second result of the functional annotation is the additional quality check for the predicted gene set. It is possible to identify problematic and/or suspicious genes by the presence of specific domains, suspicious orthology assignment and/or absence of other functional elements, e.g. functional completeness. These problematic genes can include those belonging to another species due to contamination, those detected as TEs, non-functional and/or artefact

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens. In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

- Summary: The combination of data contained in different databases allows the generation of gene and protein name dictionaries that contain significantly more used names than dictionaries obtained from individual data sources, and curation of combined dictionaries considerably increases size and decreases ambiguity.

The UniProt consortium is concerned with integrating information in the UniProt Knowledge-base. This provides a central, stable, comprehensive, fully classified, Overlap between different data sources Figure 3 Overlap between different data sources. The overlap between gene name dictionaries compiled from different data sources varies for different organisms and pairs of databases.

Currently, Swiss-Prot forms part of the UniProt Knowledgebase. With the advent of the UniProt project, the expectation will be that Swiss-Prot/UniProt and Entrez Gene will increasingly share nomenclature and that the mapping between databases will be increasingly complete and unambiguous. This will facilitate the generation of gene name dictionaries and text mining applications. Figure 4 shows the degree of ambiguity between the dictionaries and a lexicon of common English words, or domain-related non-gene and non-protein terms, respectively. This figure shows some important differences between gene names of different organisms. For the comparison of organisms we focus on the results for the combined and curated dictionaries. Yeast has the lowest ambiguity with common English words as well as with domain-related terms (0.01-0.3%, resp. 0.09-0.4%). The highest degree of ambiguity with common English words was found for fly (0.55%-2.4%). This is due to frequent phenotypic descriptions that are used as gene names and abbreviations thereof (e.g. in FlyBase, We is the abbrevia-tion and valid symbol for a gene named Washed eye, thus the abbreviation as well as the words of the long name are perfect English words). The gene nomenclature guideline for FlyBase is relatively unrestricted [29], it states that gene names must be concise, should allude to the genes function, mutant ph

    > 3. Gene annotation and functional annotation. a. Gene structure annotation.
    > In addition to gene prediction models, evidence from orthologous protein sequences and transcriptome assembly could be used to improve annotation quality. Protein sequences of orthologous genes can be obtained from UniProt (The UniProt, 2017). Ones from Swiss-Port have been reviewed and thus are of higher quality. Transcriptome assembly may be available from previous studies or can be assembled de novo from RNA-seq reads by Trinity (Haas et al., 2013). High quality transcriptome assembly can be selected as described in (Zhang et al., 2021). Note: Details about gene structure annotation (Holt and Yandell, 2011) can be found at http:// gmod.org/wiki/MAKER_Tutorial, https://darencard.net/blog/2017-05-16-maker-genomeannotation/, and the protocol (Campbell et al., 2014).
    > b. Quality measurement and functional annotation.
    > For each predicted gene, Maker2 provides the annotation edit distance (AED) score, which measures the goodness of fit between its predicted gene structure and its evidence support. The lower the score, the more accurate the prediction. If more than 90% genes with AED scores lower than 0.5, the genome can be considered well annotated. In addition to the AED score, a high proportion of recognizable domains contained in predicted protein -e.g., higher than 50% -also indicates a good annotation. Recognizable protein domains can by scanned by InterProScan (Jones et al., 2014), assigning potential function to predicted genes.
    > Note: Besides the aforementioned quality measurement, we strongly recommend measuring the completeness of the genome assembly and annotation by checking the existence of a set of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) (Simao et al., 2015). A high-level completeness of genome assembly and annotation is imperative for a better identification of gene expansion. Based on the result of this analysis, researchers can decide whether they need to further improve the genome assembly before predicting gene expansion. A detailed protocol of BUSCO is available at

    > Gene annotation was primarily derived from the S. clavuligerus reference genome in the NCBI database and was annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline 59 . However, several CA biosynthetic genes were manually corrected based on published literature 9 . For instance, two loci were originally annotated as clavaminate synthase 1 (cas1), but one of these loci is located near the cephamycin C biosynthetic cluster, indicating it was actually cas2. Following this correction, the RefSeq accession numbers of all genes in the reference genome were cross-referenced with the UniProt database to obtain additional annotations 60 . For the mutated genes identified through ICA, protein existence levels were manually assigned based on the UniProt data, including protein existence status, annotation score, similar proteins, and relevant publications.

    > Datasets can be inserted or uploaded to the web interface (Figure 2b). Data must be tab separated and formatted as shown in Figure 3A. They could include gene symbols and UniProt identifiers, which are used for the Gene Ontology annotation feature. To annotate a dataset which contains gene symbols and/ or UniProt identifiers, the appropriate organism can be set (Figure 2d) and the user can choose between full or slim GO annotation (Figure 2e) and full or experimental evidence (Figure 2f). The annotation is based on the gene and UniProt identifiers provided by UniProt-GOA and will be updated monthly.
    > It is essential that the first column contains the experimental value (log fold-change, isotope incorporation, intensity, etc.). Titles of the annotation columns are used to discriminate between different types of annotation in the results. If a pasted dataset already contains annotations such as KEGG and Pfam, these terms must reside in tab separated and titled columns (Figure 3A and online help). Annotations need to be located in the last columns. Importantly, semi-colons must separate multiple identifiers or terms in one column. For example, multiple identifiers are common for protein groups of mass spectrometric data and annotation will be done for all entries. Similarly, multiple terms are also common with Gene Ontology as one gene can be associated with several compartments at the same time and any of these terms will be treated independently. When columns of annotation are provided, the correct number of columns must be set in the respective spin-box in the web interface (Figure 2c). The dataset used in the example analysis already contains three annotation columns (KEGG, Pfam and InterPro) and is available on the web site of the tool as tab separated text file and Excel file (Figure 2a).
    > Regulation or the enrichment based on various statistics (estimators) can be tested depending on the focus of the analysis (Figure 2g). The number of resamplings R can be set in the range from 500 to 10,000 (Figure 2h).

    > It is well known that protein names are highly ambiguous [45,46]. Researchers working in specific subcommunities tend to develop their own nomenclature, resulting in multiple names for the same protein. Acronyms and abbreviations further complicate the picture. Simply being able to recognize a protein name as such is just a starting point. The name needs then to be unambiguously qualified, by referring to an entry in a standard protein database, such as UniProt http:// www.expasy.org/sprot/ [47].
    > In order for that to happen, the disambiguation must occur at two levels: interspecies (to which specific organisms does the protein mention refer?) and intraspecies (within a given organism, which specific protein is meant?). For example, a protein mentioned in text as eIF4E could refer to a large number of different proteins. A search in the Swiss-Prot section of UniProt (the manually curated section) delivers 46 possible matches. However, if the term appears contextually with the mention of a specific organism, like in the sentence 'The Cap-binding protein eIF4E promotes folding of a functional domain of yeast translation initiation factor eIF4G1' (PubMed: 10409688), then it is reasonable to assume that the name refers to a specific organism (yeast), thus restricting the possible matches in UniProt to the following two: EAP1_YEAST (eIF4E-associated protein 1) and IF4E_YEAST (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E). For the task of protein annotation, we have adopted a high-recall, low-precision term annotation approach, followed by very strict disambiguation steps, which gradually increase precision (at some expense for recall).
    > UniProt contains for each protein a list of frequently used synonyms, as well as the name and synonyms of its encoding gene. We have built a database that maps the synonyms to the protein identifier. We have further enriched such a list using morpho-syntactic rules that generate variants of the synonyms.

    > After a genome is assembled, the next step is genomic annotation, which can generate data that will allow various types of research of the model organism. Complete DNA sequences of the organism are then mapped in areas pertinent to the research objectives. In this chapter, we explore relevant ongoing research on genes and consider the gene as a basic mapping unit. Gene prediction is the first hurdle we come across to begin the extensive and intensive work demonstrated in first item, which deals with assembly of the genome. Gene prediction can be made with computational techniques for recognizing gene sequences, including stop codons and the initial portions of nucleotide sequences; it involves empirical rules concerning minimum coding sequences (CDS's) and is limited due to overlapping sequences coding forward and reverse. Finishing gene prediction step by a computer initiates the functional annotation stage. Functional annotation, item 3, can be done initially by computer, using similarity in sequence alignment. However, no software is capable of generating a functional annotation without many false positive results, since conserved protein domains with varied functions make gene sequence alignment difficult. In this case, after automatic annotation, the predicted genes need to be revised manually. In manual curation, item 4, an expert can more accurately locate frameshifts in the DNA strand. Depending on the number of errors found, genomic annotation may be postponed, requiring a return to the previous stage of genome assembly. In manual curation, the principal contributions are usually correction of the start codon position, gene name, gene product and, finally, identification of frameshifts. When functional annotation is completed, the genome should subsequently be submitted. It occurs after the assembly and annotation steps making the data generated available in public-access databanks. Submission is a pre-requisite for publication in scientific journals. Another advantage of genome publication in public-access sites is that it permits use of various genome analysis tools. For example, searches for genomic plasticity, pangenomic study, exported antigens and evaluation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The pangenome approach, item 5, concepts of species can be used as a filter for targeting candidates for vaccines, diagnostic kits and drug development. For drug development, the core set of proteins is a more likely source of useful information, for developing both vaccines and
