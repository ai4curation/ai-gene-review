## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88DT4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=L-lactate permease {ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU365092};
- **Gene Information:** Name=lldP {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70307.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_4735 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70307.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the lactate permease family.
- **Key Domains:** Lactate_perm. (IPR003804); Lactate_perm (PF02652)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "lldP" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'lldP' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **lldP** (gene ID: lldP, UniProt: Q88DT4) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

### [6] Protein-coding genes in humans and model mammals (mouse, rat and pig): gene identifiers and disambiguation of gene nomenclature retrieved from the Ensembl genome browser

- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.707)
    > Gene nomenclature contains current official symbols and various numbers of synonyms, which pose a challenge to integrating genomic data and increase the probability that different genes share the same symbol. Therefore, we retrieved identifiers assigned to all protein-coding genes in human, mouse, rat and pig genomes that are available in the Ensembl genome browser (release 113) to assess the number of genes, compare species and identify ambiguous symbols. Results: Our analysis revealed that the total number of symbols, both official symbols and synonyms, used to identify protein-coding genes ranges from 16,600 in pigs to 64,580 in mice. Furthermore, the gene nomenclature is not complete because there are also genes without an assigned symbol, which indicates gaps in understanding protein-coding genes, especially in pigs. We also found a large number of gene symbols that map to more than one gene. These symbols might complicate the identification of about 10% of rat and mouse genes and 18% of human protein-coding genes. A simple solution for this problem is the usage of stable gene IDs assigned by scientific institutions and committees (Ensembl, NCBI, RGD, HGNC and VGNC) provided that the genomic information associated with these IDs is retrieved directly from proprietary databases containing the most accurate data. Finally, although gene symbols may pose a problem with unequivocal identification of genes, there are instances when no other identifiers are available in the literature. Therefore, we have developed an R script performing search of the Ensembl database and integrating data to provide a single list of updated symbols with annotation about their ambiguity. Conclusions: Gene symbols are not always reliable and should be reported together with stable IDs to enable unequivocal identification of genes. Therefore, data containing only gene symbols should be used cautiously to avoid misidentification of genes. A solution for this problem is our R script REgeness that performs a gene symbol update to current official versions combined with identification of ambiguous symbols and retrieval of other IDs from the Ensembl database.

    > The study provides a detailed overview of Ensembl protein-coding genes and explains relationships between various gene identifiers assigned by Ensembl, NCBI and specialized committees such as MGI, RGD, HGNC and VGNC (Table 2). The most important finding is that a large number of gene symbols in the most frequently studied species, laboratory rodents and humans, can map to more than one gene, either via the official gene symbol or via a synonym (Fig. 4). Symbols that map to more than one gene may lead to confusion in 10% of rat and mouse genes and 18% of human genes, as indicated by the estimate based on the protein-coding genes in the Ensembl database (Fig. 4).
    > Our results also indicated that the impact of the symbol ambiguity is even larger after inclusion of other types of genes. Therefore, it constitutes much more severe problem than previously reported transformations of some gene symbols caused by Excel [1][2][3][4]. The misidentifications caused by symbol ambiguity are most likely in case of literature data retrieved from older studies using past versions of gene nomenclature with a large number of obsolete symbols. A simple solution for this problem is to use stable gene IDs (Table 2) for unequivocal identification of genes. Gene symbols derived from abbreviated full gene names are convenient because they convey functional meaning and can be easily memorized while the stable IDs enable disambiguation of gene nomenclature. Therefore, reporting both gene symbols and stable IDs is a best solution combining advantages of different naming systems.
    > It is important, however, to retrieve genomic information associated with gene identifiers directly from proprietary databases hosted by organizations responsible for the assignment of these IDs. Such proprietary databases contain the most accurate data that are not affected by a delayed exchange of information between databases due to different time schedules of data updates. Furthermore, genomic databases are not fully compatible due to differences in genome annotation caused by the usage of different raw sequence data, different methodology and unusual complexity of some loci that cannot be easily fitted in the canonical view of a gene [36]. The existence of such discrepancies is another reason for using proprietary databases for each type of gene identifiers (Table 2).

    > gene_input Mandatory fields are 'gene_name', 'uniprot', 'hgnc_symbol' and 'ensembl'. This file is critical for establishing the link between the scRNA-seq data and the interaction pairs stored at the protein level. It includes the following gene and protein identifiers: (i) gene name ('gene_name'), (ii) UniProt identifier ('uniprot'), (iii) HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbol ('hgnc_symbol') and (iv) gene Ensembl identifier (ENSG) ('ensembl'). To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

Currently available records of both essential and nonessential genes among a wide range of organisms can be downloaded from DEG 10, making it possible to compare the two different types of genes in many aspects 21 .

There are 31 bacterial records corresponding to 27 organisms in the database in total and 26 sets of data were selected in the current study. Streptococcus pneumonia was not chosen for the lack of non-essential genes. Since the essential genes were not genome-widely identified, it's not reasonable to regard the complementary set of essential genes as non-essential genes in Streptococcus pneumonia 29,30 . In the case of multiple records for one organism, the one with the most convincing experimental methods was chosen. The non-essential genes in Methanococcus maripaludis S2 and 13 bacteria such as Escherichia coli MG1655 are obtained based on the original literatures, while non-essential genes in other 12 organisms such as Bacillus subtilis 168 are the complementary set of essential genes. The information of the organisms used in the current study are displayed in Table 1.
    > The three model genomes' subcellular location information and the Gene Ontology (GO) terms used for the analysis in the current study were downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt; http://www.uniprot.org). Maintained by the UniProt Consortium, UniProt is committed to providing biologists with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and functional annotation 27 . Among the wealth of annotation data, detailed GO annotation statements are included.

    > Scientists can find querying datasets useful to identify expression levels between disease and normal pairs to discover differential expression for a gene. They may also want to research on potential biomarkers or pathways that lead to tumor formation or want to explore the overall expression of specific genes across multiple cancer types. Users can search BioXpress using HGNCapproved gene symbols (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee), UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot accessions or RefSeq accessions. Differentially expressed genes for a specific cancer type can also be retrieved. Additionally, all data in BioXpress, including lists of genes significantly differentially expressed in two or more cancer types, can be downloaded.

    > There are several knowledge bases that represent the collected knowledge of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome: EcoCyc (11), EcoGene (12), UniProt (13) and RefSeq (14). Other useful knowledge bases cater to specific classes of gene products, such as the RegulonDB, which contains manually curated functional information about transcription factors in E. coli (15). Our initial review of these knowledge bases yielded conflicting information on gene function and level of annotation for many E. coli genes. Any attempt to systematically assess the function of unannotated genes must therefore draw from multiple knowledge bases and resolve these conflicts.
    > Many research groups have categorized E. coli genes and proteins by annotation quality as a part of their studies. In 2009, Hu et (16). First, they identified all unannotated proteins in the K-12 W3110 and MG1655 genomes. In order for a protein-encoding gene to be considered functionally uncharacterized in their analysis, it had to meet the following criteria: (i) The gene name begins with 'y', (ii) the gene does not have a known pathway within EcoCyc and (iii) the gene does not have a functional description in Gen-ProtEC (17) (any gene with a description containing the words 'predicted', 'hypothetical', or 'conserved'). Based on these criteria, it was determined that 1431 of 4225 protein coding sequences were not functionally annotated. In 2015, Kim et al. published a database called EcoliNet that curated and predicted cofunctional gene networks for every protein coding gene in the E. coli genome (18). This study also quantified the number of uncharacterized protein coding genes in E. coli. To assess functional annotation, they used the presence of experimentally supported 'biological process' annotations in the Gene Ontology database (19). They concluded that ∼2000 protein coding genes in E. coli were not functionally annotated. The most comprehensive effort to assess the level of annotation in bacterial genomes has been Computational Bridges to Experiments (COM-BREX) (20,21).

    > Of the 19,984 protein-coding genes in C. elegans, 10,838 have a name/gene symbol (e.g. lin-12). Gene naming is largely investigator-initiated, with a request to WormBase through genenames@wormbase.org ; this will continue with C. elegans content in the Alliance. The gene symbol, which is formatted in lowercase and italics, communicates information about the gene based on mutant phenotype, functional criteria, orthology, or homology. To make genes easily recognizable to non-elegans researchers, the current preference is to name genes with human orthologs after the human gene if characterized. Gene name stability and formatting are important to avoid confusion in the literature and to facilitate searches of other databases that use the C. elegans gene symbols (e.g. UniProt) and text mining. However, occasionally names have been changed because of incorrect orthology or not supported by functional studies from the community. Names have also been changed based on requests from multiple community members (e.g. daf-21 renamed as hsp-90). To avoid name changes and to have the published name used in databases, researchers should contact WormBase prior to manuscript submission; the most common issue is that the requested name is already in use in C. elegans or another model organism for a nonhomologous gene product. Over the past 10 years, the community has averaged 180 new gene names per year, often with a corresponding publication, increasing knowledge about our favorite organism. More information about C. elegans-specific nomenclature can be found at https://wormbase.org/about/ userguide/nomenclature.

    > Many public databases of gene information are available (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16). However, different public databases often use different sets of unique identifiers (IDs) to describe the same genes or homologous genes in different species. One challenge of comparing large-scale biological datasets is the unification of gene names; otherwise, researchers spend a lot of effort in converting gene IDs when searching different databases. Another is the likelihood of missing some databases due to unfamiliarity; this is particularly true for clinicians and researchers who are specialized in inner ear research but are not necessarily familiar with genomics and bioinformatics. One goal of the SHIELD is to integrate relevant gene annotation information from various public databases in one centralized location.
    > For the SHIELD, annotations were derived from public databases and literature. Currently implemented annotations include official gene symbols, description of the gene name and synonyms, human and mouse chromosome cytogenetic banding, RefSeq RNA and protein (for protein coding genes) accession numbers, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez gene ID, genomic coordinates in both mouse reference genome assemblies mm9 and mm10, Ensembl, the Vertebrate Genome Annotation Database (VEGA) Mouse Genome Informatics, UniProt, Online Mendalian Inheritance in Man and gene ontology.
    > For each protein coding genes, we display all UniProt protein isoforms for that gene, the length in amino acid residues and the predicted number of transmembrane domains (TMs). We predicted TMs by running TMHMM2.0 run on all UniProt protein isoforms of each gene (17). The number of TMs is of special interest for research in sensory function, because many key proteins involved in signaling-such as the mechanotransduction ion channels-are integral membrane proteins. This information would help identify candidate genes for the components of the mechanotransduction apparatus of the inner ear.
    > We also performed manual curation of inner ear disorders including syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss according to the Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org) and primary literature.

Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > Functional annotation of genes involves the classification of gene functions and metabolic pathways based on existing databases. This involves the prediction of motifs, structural domains, protein functions, and the metabolic pathways in which they are located. To obtain comprehensive gene function information, we performed gene function annotations of nine databases, including Nr, Pfam, KOG, Uniprot, KEGG, GO, Pathway, Refseq, and Interproscan.
