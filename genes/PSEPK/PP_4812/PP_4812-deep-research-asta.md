## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88DL3
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Putative 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00527}; EC=3.2.2.- {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00527};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_4812 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70381.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the DNA glycosylase MPG family.
- **Key Domains:** Formyl_transferase-like_C_sf. (IPR011034); MPG. (IPR003180); MPG_sf. (IPR036995); Pur_DNA_glyco (PF02245)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_4812" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_4812' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_4812** (gene ID: PP_4812, UniProt: Q88DL3) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.711)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > The ultimate goal of the functional annotation process (Figure 4) is to assign biologically relevant information to predicted polypeptides, and to the features they derive from (e.g. gene, mRNA). This process is especially relevant nowadays in the context of the NGS era due to the capacity of sequencing, assembling, and annotating full genomes in short periods of time, e.g. less than a month. Functional elements could range from putative name and/or symbols for protein-coding genes, e.g. ADH to its putative biological function, e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase, associated gene ontology terms, e.g. GO:0004022, functional sites, e.g. METAL 47 47 Zinc 1, and domains, e.g. IPR002328, among other features. The function of predicted proteins can be computationally inferred based on the similarity between the sequence of interest and other sequences in different public repositories, e.g. BLASTP against Uniprot. Caution should be taken when assigning results merely based on sequence similarity as two evolutionary independent sequences which share some common domains could be considered homologs 62 . Thus, whenever possible, it is better to use orthologous sequences for annotation purposes rather than simply similar sequences 63 . With the growing number of sequences in those public repositories, it is possible to perform various searches and combine obtained results into a consensus annotation. The accurate assignment of the functional elements is a complex process, and the best annotation will involve manual curation.
    > There are two main outcomes of the functional annotation process. The first is the assignment of functional elements to genes. Downstream analysis of these elements allow further understanding of specific genome properties, e.g. metabolic pathways, and similarities compared with closely related species. The second result of the functional annotation is the additional quality check for the predicted gene set. It is possible to identify problematic and/or suspicious genes by the presence of specific domains, suspicious orthology assignment and/or absence of other functional elements, e.g. functional completeness.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

### [7] The shrinking human protein coding complement: are there now fewer than 20,000 genes?

- Citations: 13

- Summary: It is found that conservation across vertebrate species and the age of the gene family are key indicators of whether a peptide will be detected in proteomics experiments and that many of these 2,001 genes do not code for proteins under normal circumstances and should not be included in the human protein coding gene catalogue.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.689)
    > Together the non-protein like features, loss of reading frame and lack of protein evidence suggested that many of these genes might not code for proteins under normal circumstances.
    > We did detect proteomics evidence for several genes in this set, for example SLC5A3, which is annotated by UniProt as only having evidence of protein existence by homology, and for SPA17, which is annotated as "putative" by GENCODE. Both these genes have protein-like features and good conservation. They were in the list of potential non-coding genes because the human genome annotation project is not yet complete and these genes had yet to be annotated with evidence by GENCODE and UniProt. SPA17 is no longer tagged as "putative" in the GENCODE 18 annotation. We also identified peptides for genes with conflicting protein coding evidence, such as WASH4P and WASH6P, annotated as protein coding, but tagged as pseudogenes in the Ensembl description. Again as the human genome annotation progresses, these descriptions are likely to be refined.
    > There are genes that do not fit into the conventional coding/non-coding narrative in the non-coding set. Several genes are annotated as potentially non-functional, but may actually be functional under certain conditions. One example is FMO2, Dimethylaniline monooxygenase 2. There are two alleles, FMO2*2A, which is truncated, and FMO2*1, the full-length form. The truncated allele FMO2*2A is catalytically inactive and is probably unable to fold correctly. FMO2*1 is not present in Caucasian and Asian populations, but is found in low quantities in African populations (Veeramah et al 2008).
    > The function of the FMO2*1 variant is not clear, but it does lead to increased risk of thiourea-caused pulmonary toxicity.
    > The growth of the number of annotated read-through genes plays a role in maintaining artificially high numbers of protein coding genes in the human reference genome. Read-through genes connect two or more neighbouring genes by splicing together exons of two otherwise defined, independent loci.

    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > The NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), include protein sequence information from GenBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), SwissProt, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and Protein Research Foundation (PRF). The NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) are the nucleotide sequence database that includes nucleotide sequence from GenBank of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as cell, organism and ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. KEGG is an established Cluster of Orthologous (KO) annotation system that can accomplish the function annotation of the genome/transcriptome of a newly sequenced species. SwissProt is a manual annotated and reviewed protein sequence database that has a high-quality protein sequence database from experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions. Pfam is comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile of hidden Markov models. Many proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of a specific structural domain possesses a certain degree of conservative property. GO is the established standard for the functional annotation of gene products and controlled vocabulary used to classify the functional attributes of gene products of a biological process, a molecular function and a cellular component.

When the identified protein was not annotated by UniProt-GOA, the functional annotation of that protein was conducted using the InterProScan software according to the amino acid sequence alignment approach. All proteins were then classified into 3 groups: molecular function, cellular component and biological process.

    > The protein sequences were functionally annotated by combining information retrieved from the UniProt database ( [25], accessed on 9 June 2022) and one-to-one fast orthology assignments using the eggNOG-mapper v.2.1.7 tool ( [26], accessed on 9 June 2022), as described in [27]. Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.

Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions.

    > In a basic workflow, the GOnet application receives a list of gene symbols, protein symbols, or protein IDs (UniProt IDs) as an input, and outputs a graph (an example given in Fig. 1). There are various input parameters which will affect the actual structure of the graph visualized and its appearance. The first main user choice is which GO terms the genes are annotated against:
    > 1. GO terms statistically significantly over-represented in the gene list submitted. 2. A predefined subset (also known as 'GO slim'), or a user-supplied list of terms.
    > In the first case the analysis will be referred to as an 'enrichment' analysis, in the second as an 'annotation' analysis.
    > Input parameters 1) Gene list. A mandatory input parameter containing the genes/proteins of interest. Currently human and mouse data is supported. An example of a human gene list might look like this:
    > Fig. 1 Sample network output generated by GOnet application. Gene differentially expressed in CD4 Bulk Memory T cells in Latent TB patients compared to healthy controls were used as an example [22] The gene list can also be accompanied with a contrast value. For example, This contrast value can be any decimal number, such as the log-fold change of gene expression between two conditions. This is merely a visualization enhancement. If the value is supplied it can be used later to differentially color specific genes in the graph (note different colors of gene nodes in Fig. 1), and visually indicate up-or down-regulation of specific genes and gene clusters.
    > The application can process common gene symbols (like in the example above), UniProt IDs, and MGI Accession IDs (mouse only). The former type of ID (gene symbols), although is the most human friendly, can unfortunately be ambiguous. For example, AIM1 can mean 'absent in melanoma' (also called CRYBG1) or 'Aurora and Ipl1-like midbody-associated protein' (also known as AURKB). Due to this ambiguity UniProt IDs or MGI accession IDs (for mouse) are preferred.
    > 2) GO namespace. Can be any of 'biological process', 'molecular function' or 'cellular component'.

    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > Whole-genome sequencing has enabled investigations into the gene content of living many organisms and forms the foundation for further study of gene expression, proteomics and epigenetics. After assembly of a novel genome, gene annotation is often the first step in analysing the gene content of an organism. Accurate annotation of the exonic structure of genes is crucial to the success of all subsequent functional and comparative analyses.
    > Problems that can potentially be caused by incorrect gene annotation are numerous and can lead to incorrect assessments of the lifestyle and ecology of an organism. In comparative genomics where orthologous genes or conserved functional domains are compared between species/isolates, the estimated numbers of such genes/ domains can be distorted by less than perfect annotations (as described by Hane et al. [1], S Text 1). Prediction of extracellular secretion, which can be determined by a short signal peptide at the N-terminus, can miss secreted proteins if the start codon of a gene has been incorrectly annotated. Mis-annotating the start of protein translation could either cut off the signal peptide or bury it within the annotation. While a seemingly benign annotation error, the consequences for downstream research could be detrimental, particularly as the biotic interactions or industrial applications of microbes are largely determined by their secretomes. Additionally, translated protein sequences of novel species are often submitted to databases such as NCBI [2] and Uniprot [3]. It is commonplace to use these database entries to support the annotation of related species or isolates, meaning errors present in the pioneer annotation may be repeated. When these new annotations based on false assumptions are added to databases, there is not only a propagation of errors, but also a perceived strengthening of homology evidence for incorrect protein sequences.
    > In recent years, correction of in silico predicted gene annotations with RNA-seq derived transcripts and read alignments has enabled vastly improved genome annotations and corrections of annotated gene structures [4][5][6].

    > Protein-coding gene annotation is typically a two-step process. Initially, Prodigal is employed to identify open reading frames (ORFs) by locating gene coordinates, but it does not infer gene function. To assign putative functions, Prokka performs hierarchical annotation by comparing candidate genes to curated protein databases. It begins with a user-supplied, high-confidence protein set, using BLAST+ for sequence similarity searches. If no match is found, it progresses to UniProt's verified bacterial proteins, covering \~ 16,000 sequences, and then optionally to RefSeq proteins specific to the organism's genuscapturing nomenclature consistency. When sequence-based annotation fails, Prokka applies profile-based searches using HMMER's hmmscan to query against Pfam and TIGRFAMs databases. An e-value threshold of 10 −6 is consistently applied to ensure significance. If no reliable match is found across all levels, the gene is designated as a "hypothetical protein. " This layered strategy maximizes annotation accuracy and functional insight across diverse bacterial genomes (Seemann, 2014).

The top section identifies therapeutic targets for oncogenic activation of kinases, including wild-type kinases activated by overexpression or genomic amplification, mutated kinases with gain-offunction mutations, and kinase fusion proteins resulting from chromosomal rearrangements. II. The middle section highlights the functionalities of KinaseFusionDB, such as providing functional annotations, mRNA/protein expression data, drug binding information, and relevant literature reviews. III. The third section addresses the current limitations in targeting kinase fusion proteins, particularly the lack of comprehensive 3D structures for these proteins. It emphasizes the partial knowledge of kinase fusion protein structures and the need for further drug screening. IV. The bottom section discusses how computational approaches, such as predicted 3D structures (e.g. from AlphaFold2), can fill these gaps, supporting drug screening and filtering based on consistent binding among multiple fusion protein isoforms.
