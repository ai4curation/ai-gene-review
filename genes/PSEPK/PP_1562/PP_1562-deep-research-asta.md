## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88MK9
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Phage terminase, small subunit {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN67183.1};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_1562 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN67183.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Not specified in UniProt

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_1562" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_1562' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_1562** (gene ID: PP_1562, UniProt: Q88MK9) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

### [4] Construction of an Ortholog Database Using the Semantic Web Technology for Integrative Analysis of Genomic Data

- Summary: The ortholog database using the Semantic Web technology can contribute to biological knowledge discovery through integrative data analysis and examples demonstrate that the ortholog information described in RDF can be used to link various biological data such as taxonomy information and Gene Ontology.

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.751)
    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

- Summary: CRONOS, a cross-reference server that contains entries from five mammalian organisms presented by major gene and protein information resources, is developed, which shows that the cross-references are highly accurate.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.747)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.733)
    > Given a set of predicted protein-coding genes for a newly sequenced genome, functional annotation involves assigning putative functions to the predicted genes. Two ways in which this can be done are assigning protein names and Gene Ontology (GO;Gene Ontology Consortium, 2010) terms to the predicted proteins. Here we describe a computational pipeline for assigning protein names and GO terms to predicted proteins in parasitic worm (nematode and platyhelminth) genomes, which transfers names and GO terms from orthologues in other species.
    > When assigning protein names, UniProt protein naming rules (www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot) are followed where possible. This recommends that a good and stable name for a protein is "as neutral as possible"; that a protein name "should be, as far as possible, unique and attributed to all orthologs"; and a protein name "should not contain a specific characteristic of the protein, and in particular it should not reflect the function or role of the protein, nor its subcellular location, its domain structure, its tissue specificity, its molecular weight or its species of origin".
    > In our protocol, a protein name is assigned to each predicted protein based on curated names in UniProt (Bairoch & Apweiler, 2000) for human, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schistosoma mansoni orthologues identified from a database of gene families (e.g. built using Ensembl Compara; Vilella et al. 2009), or (if no information is found from orthologues) based on InterPro (Hunter et al. 2012) domains. Figure 1 shows an example of using our protein naming pipeline for four Strongyloides ratti genes that belong to the tubulin polyglutamylase family (underlined in pink), where four different protein names were assigned to them (in pink), based on names of their C. elegans or human orthologues.
    > Since each of the S. ratti genes belonged to a different subfamily of the tubulin polyglutamylase family, they were assigned different names.

Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

Currently available records of both essential and nonessential genes among a wide range of organisms can be downloaded from DEG 10, making it possible to compare the two different types of genes in many aspects 21 .
    > 27 prokaryotic organisms including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and Methanococcus maripaludis S2, the only record of the Archaea domain were selected to analyze the protein localization and GO distribution of the essential and nonessential genes. There are 31 bacterial records corresponding to 27 organisms in the database in total and 26 sets of data were selected in the current study. Streptococcus pneumonia was not chosen for the lack of non-essential genes. Since the essential genes were not genome-widely identified, it's not reasonable to regard the complementary set of essential genes as non-essential genes in Streptococcus pneumonia 29,30 . In the case of multiple records for one organism, the one with the most convincing experimental methods was chosen. The non-essential genes in Methanococcus maripaludis S2 and 13 bacteria such as Escherichia coli MG1655 are obtained based on the original literatures, while non-essential genes in other 12 organisms such as Bacillus subtilis 168 are the complementary set of essential genes. The information of the organisms used in the current study are displayed in Table 1.
    > The three model genomes' subcellular location information and the Gene Ontology (GO) terms used for the analysis in the current study were downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt; http://www.uniprot.org). Maintained by the UniProt Consortium, UniProt is committed to providing biologists with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and functional annotation 27 . Among the wealth of annotation data, detailed GO annotation statements are included.

    > The phylogenetic tree of the large terminase subunit was constructed by recovering large terminases from the aforementioned protein-clustering and annotation pipeline. The coding sequences that matched with >30 bitscore to PFAM, TIGRFAMS, VOG and pVOG were retained. Any coding sequence that had a hit to large terminase, regardless of bitscore, was searched using HHblits 70 against the uniclust30_2018_08 database. The resulting alignment was then further searched against the PDB70 database. Remaining coding sequences that clustered in protein families with a large terminase HMM were also included after manual verification. Detected large terminases were manually verified using the HHPred 70 and jPred 71 webservers. Large terminases from the >200-kb phage genomes 14 and all >200-kb complete dsDNA phage genomes from RefSeq r92 were also included by protein family clustering with the phage-coding sequences from this study. The resulting terminases were clustered at 95% amino acid identity to reduce redundancy using CD-HIT 72 . Smaller phage genomes were included by searching the resulting coding sequences set against the full RefSeq protein database and retaining the top 10 best hits. Those hits that had no large terminase match against PFAM, TIGR-FAMS, VOG or pVOG were removed from further consideration and the remaining set was clustered at 90% amino acid identity. The final set of large terminase coding sequences that were more than 100 amino acids in length were aligned using MAFFT 73 v.7.407 (--localpair --maxiterate 1000) and poorly aligned sequences were removed and the resulting set was realigned. The phylogenetic tree was inferred using IQTREE v.1.6.6 using automatic model selection 74 . The phylogenetic tree of MCP genes was constructed by retrieving all MCPs annotated by combining the PFAM annotations of protein families and direct annotations by PFAM, TIGRFAMS, VOG and pVOG. Reference MCP gene sequences were collected using the same strategy and sources as for the large terminase subunit tree.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > To get comprehensive gene function of rambai genes, gene annotation to seven databases, namely National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein sequences (NR), NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome Ortholog (KO), SwissProt, Protein family (Pfam), Gene Ontology (GO) and Cluster of Orthologous Groups (KOG), was used as reference.
    > The NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), include protein sequence information from GenBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), SwissProt, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and Protein Research Foundation (PRF). The NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) are the nucleotide sequence database that includes nucleotide sequence from GenBank of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as cell, organism and ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. KEGG is an established Cluster of Orthologous (KO) annotation system that can accomplish the function annotation of the genome/transcriptome of a newly sequenced species. SwissProt is a manual annotated and reviewed protein sequence database that has a high-quality protein sequence database from experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions. Pfam is comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile of hidden Markov models. Many proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of a specific structural domain possesses a certain degree of conservative property. GO is the established standard for the functional annotation of gene products and controlled vocabulary used to classify the functional attributes of gene products of a biological process, a molecular function and a cellular component.

    > Single-gene search: Gene annotation is essential for biologists to understand a gene's function. MTD's single-gene search interface allows researchers to obtain a comprehensive gene description by entering or selecting a gene ID. The results include sequence information, CAZy family, Pfam domains, GO/KEGG annotations, and phenotype information (Fig. 2D), along with sequence-based predictions such as optimal protein activity temperature, melting temperature (Tm), subcellular localization, and transcription factor scores. To enhance data accessibility, links to external databases such as NCBI, KEGG, FungiDB [4], UniProt, and JGI are also provided, facilitating cross-referencing of gene annotations across various resources.
    > Unlike the static genome, the transcriptome captures dynamic gene expression changes in response to developmental or environmental conditions, establishing a dynamic link between an organism's genome and its physical characteristics [63]. In the single-gene retrieval interface, the expression of the searched gene is visualized in the form of box plots and scatter plots across transcriptome datasets (Fig. 2E). When hovering over any data point, users can view the corresponding experimental details, such as mutant name, sample processing methods, and growth conditions. This interactive feature reveals gene expression responses to environmental factors, allowing researchers to quickly identify experimental conditions of interest and explore the gene's potential roles in diverse biological contexts. Moreover, clicking on the dataset title will direct users to the GEO browser for further detailed descriptions. KEGG Pathway or Gene List Search: In transcriptome studies, researchers typically adopt a "bottom-up" approach: first sequencing all mRNA in a cell, identifying differentially expressed genes between conditions, and then performing GO/KEGG enrichment analysis to interpret functional distributions. MTD, however, offers a complementary "top-down" search strategy, enabling users to examine the expression of genes within a specific KEGG pathway (Fig. 3A) or a user-defined gene set. A unique feature of MTD is its manually curated data categorization system, which organizes sample data with detailed annotations based on experimental conditions.

    > There are several knowledge bases that represent the collected knowledge of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome: EcoCyc (11), EcoGene (12), UniProt (13) and RefSeq (14). Other useful knowledge bases cater to specific classes of gene products, such as the RegulonDB, which contains manually curated functional information about transcription factors in E. coli (15). Our initial review of these knowledge bases yielded conflicting information on gene function and level of annotation for many E. coli genes. Any attempt to systematically assess the function of unannotated genes must therefore draw from multiple knowledge bases and resolve these conflicts.
    > Many research groups have categorized E. coli genes and proteins by annotation quality as a part of their studies. In 2009, Hu et (16). First, they identified all unannotated proteins in the K-12 W3110 and MG1655 genomes. In order for a protein-encoding gene to be considered functionally uncharacterized in their analysis, it had to meet the following criteria: (i) The gene name begins with 'y', (ii) the gene does not have a known pathway within EcoCyc and (iii) the gene does not have a functional description in Gen-ProtEC (17) (any gene with a description containing the words 'predicted', 'hypothetical', or 'conserved'). Based on these criteria, it was determined that 1431 of 4225 protein coding sequences were not functionally annotated. In 2015, Kim et al. published a database called EcoliNet that curated and predicted cofunctional gene networks for every protein coding gene in the E. coli genome (18). This study also quantified the number of uncharacterized protein coding genes in E. coli. To assess functional annotation, they used the presence of experimentally supported 'biological process' annotations in the Gene Ontology database (19). They concluded that ∼2000 protein coding genes in E. coli were not functionally annotated. The most comprehensive effort to assess the level of annotation in bacterial genomes has been Computational Bridges to Experiments (COM-BREX) (20,21).

    > In an effort to engage the collective expertise of the scientific community, we have implemented a collaborative wiki (MediaWiki version 1.19.11) for the Mnemiopsis gene complement. The Mnemiopsis Gene Wiki is accessible from the left sidebar of most pages and is searchable either by selecting a Mnemiopsis gene identifier (e.g., ML00011a) from the drop-down menu or by manually entering an identifier in the appropriate search box. Users can also access these pages by clicking on a gene in the 2.2 track of the genome browser. Each record in the Gene Wiki represents a single Mnemiopsis gene and provides the following annotation: nucleotide and protein sequences, coding exonic genomic coordinates, pre-computed BLAST hits from numerous organisms displaying the top hits for each protein, the top non-self BLAST hit to Mnemiopsis, Pfam-A domains, Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations, human disease genes from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and a table of ortholog clusters formed by phylogenetically informed clustering methods [4] (Figure 5). In addition, controlled editable sections have been included that permit (and encourage) the scientific community to provide further gene annotation for isoforms, in situ images, references, and other notes for each gene. Users interested in supplementing our gene model annotation at the Mnemiopsis Gene Wiki pages must first create an account and log in prior to submitting their contributions. In-house subject matter expert data curators are notified by e-mail following the creation of a new user account or an edit to an existing Gene Wiki record. Any content changes or additions to the Gene Wiki are thoroughly evaluated by these data curators and are made public subject to their approval.
    > Pre-compiled BLAST hits are enumerated in tabular form. Each Mnemiopsis protein was compared to the UniProt and NCBI non-redundant protein databases (nr) using BLASTP. The results display the hit number, the accession numbers, E-values, and brief descriptions of the top four hits (lowest E-values). Accession numbers are linked to relevant corresponding entries at UniProt and GenBank.

    > Gene nomenclature contains current official symbols and various numbers of synonyms, which pose a challenge to integrating genomic data and increase the probability that different genes share the same symbol. Therefore, we retrieved identifiers assigned to all protein-coding genes in human, mouse, rat and pig genomes that are available in the Ensembl genome browser (release 113) to assess the number of genes, compare species and identify ambiguous symbols. Results: Our analysis revealed that the total number of symbols, both official symbols and synonyms, used to identify protein-coding genes ranges from 16,600 in pigs to 64,580 in mice. Furthermore, the gene nomenclature is not complete because there are also genes without an assigned symbol, which indicates gaps in understanding protein-coding genes, especially in pigs. We also found a large number of gene symbols that map to more than one gene. These symbols might complicate the identification of about 10% of rat and mouse genes and 18% of human protein-coding genes. A simple solution for this problem is the usage of stable gene IDs assigned by scientific institutions and committees (Ensembl, NCBI, RGD, HGNC and VGNC) provided that the genomic information associated with these IDs is retrieved directly from proprietary databases containing the most accurate data. Finally, although gene symbols may pose a problem with unequivocal identification of genes, there are instances when no other identifiers are available in the literature. Therefore, we have developed an R script performing search of the Ensembl database and integrating data to provide a single list of updated symbols with annotation about their ambiguity. Conclusions: Gene symbols are not always reliable and should be reported together with stable IDs to enable unequivocal identification of genes. Therefore, data containing only gene symbols should be used cautiously to avoid misidentification of genes. A solution for this problem is our R script REgeness that performs a gene symbol update to current official versions combined with identification of ambiguous symbols and retrieval of other IDs from the Ensembl database.

    > Protein-coding gene annotation is typically a two-step process. Initially, Prodigal is employed to identify open reading frames (ORFs) by locating gene coordinates, but it does not infer gene function. To assign putative functions, Prokka performs hierarchical annotation by comparing candidate genes to curated protein databases. It begins with a user-supplied, high-confidence protein set, using BLAST+ for sequence similarity searches. If no match is found, it progresses to UniProt's verified bacterial proteins, covering \~ 16,000 sequences, and then optionally to RefSeq proteins specific to the organism's genuscapturing nomenclature consistency. When sequence-based annotation fails, Prokka applies profile-based searches using HMMER's hmmscan to query against Pfam and TIGRFAMs databases. An e-value threshold of 10 −6 is consistently applied to ensure significance. If no reliable match is found across all levels, the gene is designated as a "hypothetical protein. " This layered strategy maximizes annotation accuracy and functional insight across diverse bacterial genomes (Seemann, 2014).
    > The genome of coliphage ASEC2201 has been analyzed and three holin protein coding genes were selected. The sequences of all three holin proteins were retrieved from NCBI using accession no. SRX17770782 in the FASTA format. The sequence similarity search was performed via BLAST against the non-redundant database (Altschul et al., 1990).
