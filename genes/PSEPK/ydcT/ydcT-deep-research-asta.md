## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88MT4
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Predicted polyamine ABC transporter, ATP-binding protein {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN67106.1}; EC=3.6.3.31 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN67106.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=ydcT {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN67106.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_1484 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN67106.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** AAA+_ATPase. (IPR003593); ABC_SmlMolc_Importer. (IPR050093); ABC_transporter-like_ATP-bd. (IPR003439); ABC_transporter-like_CS. (IPR017871); Mo/tungstate-bd_C_term_dom. (IPR008995)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ydcT" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ydcT' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ydcT** (gene ID: ydcT, UniProt: Q88MT4) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > In addition to the systematic experimental verification of novel annotations in three GO categories as described above, here we highlight individual predictions for which we found supporting evidence in the publicly available databases. This information was not available to the classifiers at the time when the models were constructed. The following examples are for E. coli K12, as this is by far the best-studied model prokaryote [21].
    > We predict genes hypC and hybG to have ''nickel cation binding.'' These genes had no GO terms assigned in the 07-02-2012 UniProt-GOA release (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/ P0AAM3 and http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0AAM7), and we therefore considered them unannotated. In the meantime, hypC was annotated with ''metal ion binding'' using experimental evidence: this is a parent GO term of our prediction. Moreover, when examining the literature, we found evidence that these two genes are involved in the biosynthesis of the [NiFe] cluster [22].
    > Another prediction is for gltL: we predicted it is annotated with ''ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complex.'' In line with our predictions, PortEco, a portal that includes information from 14 different E. coli data resources [23], labels the gene as ''ATPbinding component of ABC superfamily.'' Note that more general electronic GO annotations were available for this gene, e.g. ''ATP binding,'' ''ATPase activity,'' and ''ATP catabolic process'' (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0AAG3).
    > A similar prediction of a more detailed function is for ybgI, where we predict GO terms from both BP and MF ontologies. This gene is known to be a conserved metal-binding protein [24], having an electronic GO annotation ''metal ion binding''; we predict it is annotated with the BP GO term ''Mo-molybdopterin cofactor metabolic process.''

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

We established the following rules for generalizing genes into functional groups: Chaperone: genes that encode proteins that perform chaperone or chaperonin-like activities (Uniprot Keyword: KW-0143); Envelope: Genes that encode proteins involved in the maintenance of the cell-envelope such as phospholipid biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0008654) and peptidoglycan biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0000270); Metabolism: Genes that encode proteins involved in general metabolic functions, such as purine metabolism (KEGG: eco00230), amino acid metabolism (KEGG: eco00470, eco00330); or TCA Cycle (KEGG: eco00020); Regulators: Genes that encode proteins directly involved in transcription (GO-BP: 0031564; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0804), translation (GO-BP:0006412, GO-BP:0006413; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0689), or the regulation of transcription (GO-BP: 0006355, GO-BP:2000143, GO-BP:0006353, GO-BP: GO:0045893; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0805); and Transport: Genes that encode proteins involved in transport: such as ABC transporters (Interpro: PR017871), MFS transporters (Interpro: IPR011701); symporters (Interpro: IPR023954, IPR001204, IPR001734, IPR023025, IPR004840), or Antiporters (Interpro: IPR004771). A combination of resources were used to determine if a parallel mutation arose in a functional region of a protein including, EcoCyc, 96 UniProt, 97 and the primary literature (see supplemental bibliography).

    > Sequence similarity analyses were accomplished using blastx [26] against the NCBI non-redundant database on protein level [32], the Swissprot database [33,34] and KEGG [35]. Additionally, manual gene annotation was performed using PRIAM [36], Motif Scan [37], Prosite  [38], BRENDA [39,40], UniProt/SwissProt [34], Inter-ProScan [41], and Pfam [42] databases. One example of how our manual annotation differed from that of the automated pipeline used by Brown et al. can be found in the case of CLAU_3519 (CAETHG_3609). Here the automated pipeline from the Brown et al. finished genome assigned this gene product as a hypothetical protein, however when the sequence was aligned using BLASTP as part of our manual curation all other proteins with >75 % identity were named sodium ABC transporter. Upon further inspection in Pfam, one large ABC-2 family transporter protein domain was found (E-value 6.8e-31). Similar searches of UniProt and KEGG databases agreed with Pfam, therefore we annotated this gene product as an ABC-2 family transporter. The correction of the previously short-called homopolymer reads through our sequencing efforts gave a fully annotated finished sequence of C. autoethanogenum without the erroneous frame-shift containing annotations which had occurred previously. Using these tools we were able to manually curate the entire genome to ensure that the automated annotation was correct and to insert additional information where required, as well as implementing a standardised protein product naming system as recommend by the NCBI guidelines [43] for ease of identification of genes with related functions. As a consequence of the automated and subsequent manual curation, we have found 482 instances across the genome where genes previously identified as 'hypothetical protein' have either been assigned a specific function, or have been named through identification of conserved domains based on sequence similarity.

    > However, the peaks were in different positions within the gene in the four individual experiments performed (Fig. 6), and no specific binding site within the mRNA could be identified from the data.
    > Among the genes identified were numerous genes related to protein biosynthesis (tRNAs, tRNA-aminoacyl synthetases, tRNA-modifying enzymes, ribosomal proteins). As an example, genes for ribosomal proteins were highly represented with 18 out of the 22 genes (82%) for small ribosomal proteins, (12 after cold shock, 55%), and 31 out of 34 genes (91%) for large ribosomal subunit proteins (22 after cold shock, 65%). Other protein families represented were chaperones (e.g., dnaK, dnaJ, grpE, but not dafA, groES, groEL, clpB), cold-shock and general stress proteins (TT_RS08235, _09210; hsp22, hsp30; uspA), topoisomerase genes (gyrA, gyrB, topA), genes for transporters and their subunits (often both the gene for the substrate-bind-ing protein and for the permease, for example, branchedchain amino acid ABC transporter, TT_RS01115 and _01120), and genes related to sugar-and cell wall metabolism and cell division, as well as CRISPR-related genes. In many cases, genes for all subunits of protein complexes (e.g., genes for cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II; clpA, clpX coding for the ClpAX protease) were present.

Membrane proteins were predicted using transmembrane helical Markov model (TMHMM) [11] (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Proteins in the solute carrier protein (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter families were identified according to gene and protein name. We also used website gene names (www.genenames.org/data) to characterise the subcellular location of the transporter and the type of substrate they transport.

    > To obtain comprehensive gene function information, we performed gene function annotation using eight major databases, including UniProt [23], KEGG [24] and KEGG Pathway, GO [25], Pfam [26], COG [27], TIGERfams [28], RefSeq, and NR. The predicted gene sequences were aligned against functional databases such as COG, KEGG, UniProt, and RefSeq using BLAST+ (Version: 2.11.0+), resulting in the gene function annotation outcomes. The statistical results of the annotations are shown in Table S2. Among the top 20 domains annotated based on Pfam, we observed that genes belonging to "ABC transporters" were the most abundant (Figure 2A). As we know, ABC transporters comprise a large superfamily of proteins that facilitate the translocation of a diverse array of substrates, including ions and macromolecules, across cellular membranes through ATP binding and hydrolysis. Furthermore, these transporters are also critically involved in the cellular uptake and efflux of numerous organic pollutants [29,30]. These results suggest that the abundance of ABC transporter genes provides Paracoccus sp. P-2 with a significant capacity for deltamethrin transport. As shown in Figure 2B, the genes annotated by KEGG are divided into 5 major categories and 23 minor subcategories. Among them, the subcategory with the largest number of genes is metabolic pathways, which include amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, among others. The abundance of genes related to metabolic pathways provides the fundamental basis for the survival and deltamethrin degradation capability of Paracoccus sp. P-2. It is worth noting that a substantial number (254) of membrane transporter genes have been annotated in the genome of Paracoccus sp. P-2. Pollutants are often adsorbed onto the microbial membrane surface and subsequently internalized into the cells-a process in which membrane transporter proteins play a crucial role [31]. This abundance of transporter genes highlights the strain's strong capacity for pollutant transport.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > Previously, Wilson et al. (2006) reported that Clusters 7 and 8 of Valk et al. (2004) had a gene expression profile most similar to cluster B. It has been noted that one of genes overexpressed by these patients was ABCG2, a member of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of membrane transporters, also termed breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP1), later dubbed as a stem cell marker and a target in cancer stem cell therapy (Ding et al., 2010). Moreover, ABCG2 protein overexpression in concurrence with FLT3-ITD mutation identifies a subgroup of AML patients with significantly worse prognosis (Tiribelli et al., 2011).
    > Our analysis of the top most significant discriminating genes from all three clusters revealed an unanticipated phenomenon: these clusters were enriched in genes functionally involved in membrane transport -transporters and channels (Table 1). Here protein functions are described according to UniprotKB1 and Gene Ontology2 databases. For gene function annotation from UniprotKB, reviewed (curator-evaluated) computational records (Swiss-Prot) were used. Below, a review of the specific gene functional roles is presented. This review is only intended to show data that are relevant for this particular context. For multiple genes listed below exhaustive literature reviews do exist.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > UniProt is currently the main linking point to GO and KEGG pathway in SPLASH as it is a high quality and extensively cross-referenced information hub for protein sequences. While UniProt accession number is used for retrieving and integrating all known information about a protein, we use IPI sequence database for protein identification by MS and MS/MS experiments, as this database also includes annotated gene splice variants, thus ensuring protein identification with greater confidence. The identified protein is then assigned its UniProt accession number (if available) through cross-referencing between the two databases. However, for those proteins that are not in UniProt or have not been annotated with GO or KEGG data, our current approach is to find the sequence homologue of the unmatched protein and extract its UniProt accession number for further analysis. Although sequence homologues can be inferred to have similar function, it is possible that the protein identified by BLAST may not be the "correct" protein. Thus it may be annotated with incorrect GO or KEGG information. In addition, it is important to point out that some of the GO annotation is based on inferred from electronic annotation (IEA), known to be a source of errors as no curator has checked the annotation to verify its accuracy. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are in an active process of devising a reliability index for GO and KEGG annotation in order to improve data accuracy.

To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > Gene SSU_RS04755 has been predicted to encode a basic membrane family protein (BMP), a transmembrane component of specific ABC transporters. Growth curve experiments did not reveal a significant reduction in the growth rate of our ΔSSU_RS04755 mutant. The operon genes with SSU_RS04755 were predicted to encode an ATPbinding protein and a permease which are typical components of an ABC transporter. Both predicted ATPbinding protein and permease encoding genes appeared as CEGs in our Tn-seq results (Table 1). The protein sequence associated with SSU_RS04755 shares significant identity with lipoproteins that are components of nucleoside ABC transporters in Gram-positive bacteria (see above), suggesting that SSU_RS04755 and its operon genes may encode an ABC transporter complex involved in nucleoside transport. To investigate the possible functional equivalence of SSU_RS04755 operon genes with ABC transporters, we performed amino acid sequence alignments of SSU_RS04755 with PnrA and TmpC, which are homologous nucleoside binding lipoproteins from S. pneumoniae and Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) respectively [49,50]. Using the crystal structure of PnrA binding to adenosine [49], we confirmed that all but one (T70) of the specific amino acids involved in adenosine binding by PnrA were conserved in SSU_RS04755 (Figure 5(c)).
    > To verify if the structural positions of these amino acids were conserved, we performed a structural prediction (see methods) of the predicted S. suis lipoprotein SSU_RS04755 and aligned it to the structure of PnrA (ID 6y9U in Protein Data Bank (PDB). We confirmed that all amino acids involved in the adenosine binding are located at the same position in both protein structures.
