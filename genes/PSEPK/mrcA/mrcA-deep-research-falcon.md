## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88CU6
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Penicillin-binding protein 1A {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00018638}; EC=2.4.99.28 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00044770}; EC=3.4.16.4 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00012448};
- **Gene Information:** Name=mrcA {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70649.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_5084 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70649.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** In the N-terminal section; belongs to the
- **Key Domains:** Beta-lactam/transpept-like. (IPR012338); Glyco_trans_51. (IPR001264); Glycosyltr_51/Transpeptidase. (IPR050396); Lysozyme-like_dom_sf. (IPR023346); PBP_transglycosylase. (IPR036950)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "mrcA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'mrcA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **mrcA** (gene ID: mrcA, UniProt: Q88CU6) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and approach
We first verified target identity and domain architecture, then gathered recent (2023–2024) and authoritative literature on class A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs), prioritizing Pseudomonas-focused sources where available. We synthesized enzymology, regulation, cellular localization, pathway context, and organism-specific insights (Pseudomonas and E. coli as reference Gram-negative models). Finally, we organized current applications and expert perspectives, and summarize key facts in an artifact table. (URLs are provided inline; formal support is cited using context IDs.)

*Table: Concise, evidence-linked summary of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 mrcA (PBP1A, UniProt Q88CU6) covering identity, domains, activities, substrates, inhibitors, localization, regulation, roles, essentiality, and recent (2023–2024) findings; citations indicate the supporting context IDs.*

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and domain architecture: mrcA encodes Penicillin-binding protein 1A (PBP1A), a class A high-molecular-mass PBP. aPBPs are bifunctional cell-wall synthases with an N-terminal membrane anchor and large periplasmic catalytic modules: a glycosyltransferase (GT) domain and a D,D-transpeptidase (TP) domain; noncatalytic regions serve as docking platforms for regulators. This architecture and role are conserved across Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas species (reviewed in Pazos & Vollmer 2021; Typas et al. 2010). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.038 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 1-2, typas2010regulationofpeptidoglycan pages 1-3, pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 2-4)
- Catalytic activities and substrates: PBP1A catalyzes (i) GTase activity (EC 2.4.99.28) that polymerizes glycan strands from the lipid II precursor and (ii) Ser-type D,D-TPase activity (EC 3.4.16.4) that crosslinks peptide stems to the existing sacculus. The TP reaction depends on ongoing GTase on the same enzyme; lipid II is the GT substrate. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008; recent functional genetics confirm aPBP synthase–hydrolase coordination and stress-dependent performance differences between PBP1A and PBP1B in E. coli. https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00325-24 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 1-2, alodaini2024reducedpeptidoglycansynthesis pages 1-2, pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 6-7)
- Inhibitors: The TPase active site is acylated by β-lactam antibiotics, while the GTase is inhibited by moenomycin, which binds the donor glycan site. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008; see Pseudomonas context for PBPs as β-lactam targets. https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01651-16 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 1-2, chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-3, pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 2-4)
- Localization: PBP1A is inner-membrane anchored, with periplasmic catalytic domains acting at the peptidoglycan layer. aPBPs operate in complexes bridging the inner and outer membranes via periplasm-spanning partners. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.038; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008 (typas2010regulationofpeptidoglycan pages 1-3, pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 1-2)
- Regulation by outer-membrane lipoproteins: In Gram-negative γ-proteobacteria, aPBPs require OM lipoprotein activators. E. coli PBP1A is activated by LpoA and PBP1B by LpoB. Pseudomonas species employ a related OM activator (LpoP) to stimulate cognate aPBP GT and TP activities (as summarized in Pazos & Vollmer 2021; foundational evidence from Typas et al. 2010 for OM regulation paradigm). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.038 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 6-7, typas2010regulationofpeptidoglycan pages 1-3, pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 2-4)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Stress-dependent division of labor between PBP1A and PBP1B: In E. coli, large-scale genetic interaction mapping and phenotyping under envelope stress show robust redundancy of aPBPs with notable stress dependencies—ΔmrcB (PBP1B) cells are specifically impaired at high salt, consistent with reduced PBP1A activity in vitro under high ionic strength. This clarifies environmental modulation of aPBP function and synthase–hydrolase robustness. mBio (Apr 2024). https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00325-24 (alodaini2024reducedpeptidoglycansynthesis pages 1-2)
- Continued consolidation of aPBP regulation mechanisms: Reviews emphasize that OM lipoprotein activators (LpoA/LpoB/LpoP) allosterically stimulate aPBP activities and integrate aPBPs with division and elongation systems, aligning with the periplasm-spanning regulation first defined by Typas et al. 2010. Current Opinion in Microbiology (Apr 2021). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 2-4, pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 6-7)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Antibacterial targeting of aPBPs: β-lactams target the TPase domain of aPBPs, a cornerstone of clinical antibiotics. In Pseudomonas, PBPs are established β-lactam targets; essentiality varies by PBP and condition, affecting susceptibility and resistance profiling. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (Jan 2017). https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01651-16 (chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-3, chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 3-5)
- Chemical probes and natural products: Moenomycin is a well-characterized GTase inhibitor used extensively as a biochemical probe of aPBP polymerase function and to dissect synthase–hydrolase coordination. Mechanistic context summarized in Pazos & Vollmer 2021; Typas et al. 2010. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.038 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 1-2, typas2010regulationofpeptidoglycan pages 1-3)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- aPBPs as central, regulated synthases: Pazos & Vollmer synthesize structural, biochemical, and systems-level data to conclude that aPBPs are pivotal for peptidoglycan growth and repair, with activities critically controlled by OM lipoprotein activators and multi-enzyme complex formation. They note species differences in essentiality and functional partitioning, and that aPBPs provide mechanical stability (e.g., PBP1B loss decreases stiffness in E. coli). Current Opinion in Microbiology (Apr 2021). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 2-4, pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 6-7)
- OM-based regulation paradigm: Typas et al. defined the LpoA/LpoB activation of PBP1A/PBP1B, respectively, establishing the periplasm-spanning regulation concept that extends to Pseudomonas (with LpoP as a Pseudomonas-specific activator). Cell (Dec 2010). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.038 (typas2010regulationofpeptidoglycan pages 1-3)
- Pseudomonas PBPs and druggability: Chen et al. showed variable essentiality among high-molecular-mass PBPs in P. aeruginosa, with PBP3 essential and PBP1A disruptions affecting motility and morphology, supporting nuanced targeting strategies. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (Jan 2017). https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01651-16 (chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 3-5, chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-3)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- E. coli genetic interaction mapping under stress (2024): Systematic interaction analysis of aPBPs with multiple hydrolases revealed few strict dependencies, underscoring robustness of PG growth; ΔmrcB showed significant fitness loss at high salt, with in vitro data indicating reduced PBP1A activity at high salt. mBio (Apr 2024). https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00325-24 (alodaini2024reducedpeptidoglycansynthesis pages 1-2)
- Mechanistic inhibition details: Moenomycin binds donor site in GT domain to block polymerization; β-lactams acylate TP active site serine. Structural and biochemical synthesis in reviews consolidate these mechanisms. Current Opinion in Microbiology (Apr 2021). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 2-4, pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 1-2)

Organism- and gene-specific synthesis for Pseudomonas putida KT2440 mrcA (Q88CU6)
- Mandatory verification: The gene symbol mrcA is widely used for PBP1A in Gram-negative bacteria. For P. putida KT2440, the ordered locus PP_5084 corresponds to PBP1A (per the prompt’s UniProt record Q88CU6). This matches the aPBP architecture and enzymology summarized in authoritative reviews and Pseudomonas literature, with no conflicting alternate gene identity found; thus, the symbol here is not ambiguous in this organismal context (supported by the conserved class A PBP features and OM-lipoprotein activation paradigm). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.038 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 1-2, typas2010regulationofpeptidoglycan pages 1-3)
- Primary function: A bifunctional peptidoglycan synthase performing GT (EC 2.4.99.28) using lipid II to polymerize glycan chains and TP (EC 3.4.16.4) to crosslink peptide stems; β-lactams inhibit TP and moenomycin inhibits GT. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 1-2, pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 2-4)
- Localization: Inner-membrane anchored with periplasmic catalytic domains that operate at the peptidoglycan layer. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.038 (typas2010regulationofpeptidoglycan pages 1-3)
- Regulation and partners: Expected activation by an OM lipoprotein (Lpo family); in Pseudomonas, the related activator LpoP stimulates its cognate aPBP’s GT and TP activities (summarized in Pazos & Vollmer). The aPBP also interacts functionally with peptidoglycan hydrolases, with coordinated activities essential for safe insertion and remodeling. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 6-7, pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 2-4)
- Roles in elongation and division: Class A PBPs contribute to both lateral wall growth and septal PG synthesis/repair, forming multi-enzyme complexes that integrate with divisome and elongasome components. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 1-2, pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 6-7)
- Essentiality and redundancy: Direct KT2440 knockout/essentiality data for mrcA are limited in the present evidence. In E. coli, PBP1A (mrcA) and PBP1B (mrcB) exhibit partial redundancy with stress-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., high-salt sensitivity without PBP1B due to reduced PBP1A activity). In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most high-molecular-mass PBPs are individually nonessential under standard conditions, with PBP3 essential; PBP1A mutants show motility/morphology defects, illustrating organism-specific and condition-dependent requirements. Extrapolating cautiously, P. putida KT2440 mrcA likely functions redundantly with mrcB for core PG synthesis but may contribute distinctly to envelope robustness and fitness under specific stresses or growth regimes. https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00325-24; https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01651-16 (alodaini2024reducedpeptidoglycansynthesis pages 1-2, chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 3-5, chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-3)

Pathway placement and mechanistic context
- Biosynthetic pathway: PBP1A acts late in the peptidoglycan pathway, using lipid II delivered to the periplasm to extend glycan chains and crosslink to the existing sacculus. aPBP function complements the SEDS–class B PBP (RodA–PBP2; FtsW–PBP3) machineries that form the core elongation and division synthases; aPBPs provide substantial flux and repair capacity and are integrated via periplasmic regulators. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2021.01.008 (pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 1-2, pazos2021regulationandfunction pages 6-7)
- Hydrolase coordination: Growth requires tightly coupled synthase–hydrolase action; large-scale interaction mapping shows no single amidase/endopeptidase is strictly required for either aPBP, highlighting robustness and distributed coordination. https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00325-24 (alodaini2024reducedpeptidoglycansynthesis pages 1-2)

Evidence limitations and notes
- While Pseudomonas aeruginosa PBPs have been systematically interrogated, direct genetic and biochemical characterizations specific to P. putida KT2440 mrcA (PP_5084) are limited in the present evidence set. Nevertheless, class A PBP architecture, regulation by OM lipoproteins (Lpo family), and enzymology are highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, supporting functional inference for KT2440. Future work should explicitly profile PP_5084 essentiality/phenotypes, map its lipoprotein activator (e.g., LpoP/LpoA ortholog reliance), and quantify stress-specific roles in KT2440.

Conclusion
The Pseudomonas putida KT2440 mrcA gene product is a canonical class A PBP (PBP1A), a bifunctional peptidoglycan synthase that polymerizes lipid II-derived glycans and crosslinks peptide stems in the periplasm. Its TP activity is inhibited by β-lactams and its GT activity by moenomycin. aPBP activity and pathway integration are regulated by outer-membrane lipoprotein activators (Lpo family; Pseudomonas employs a related activator), and the enzyme functions within multi-protein complexes that coordinate with hydrolases during elongation and division. Recent work (2024) refines understanding of aPBP functional redundancy and environmental sensitivity, reinforcing the central yet regulated role of aPBPs in maintaining envelope integrity and antibiotic susceptibility in Gram-negative bacteria.
