description: >
  Penicillin-binding protein 1A (PBP1A) is a bifunctional class A high-molecular-mass
  penicillin-binding protein that catalyzes both glycosyltransferase (GT) and
  D,D-transpeptidase (TP) activities essential for peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The
  N-terminal GT domain (EC 2.4.99.28) polymerizes glycan strands from lipid II precursors,
  while the C-terminal TP domain (EC 3.4.16.4) cross-links peptide stems to form the
  mature peptidoglycan sacculus. The enzyme is inner membrane-anchored with catalytic
  domains operating in the periplasmic space. In Gram-negative bacteria, PBP1A activity
  is regulated by outer membrane lipoprotein activators (LpoA/LpoP family). The TP
  domain is the target of beta-lactam antibiotics while the GT domain is inhibited by
  moenomycin. PBP1A functions redundantly with PBP1B (mrcB) for core peptidoglycan
  synthesis but shows stress-specific requirements.

      PBP1A is an inner membrane-anchored protein with large periplasmic catalytic
      domains that operate at the peptidoglycan layer interface. The TreeGrafter
      annotation correctly places the functional site in the periplasmic space where
      the enzyme synthesizes and crosslinks peptidoglycan [Pazos & Vollmer 2021,
      Typas et al. 2010].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      The localization is well-supported by the protein architecture: PBP1A has an
      N-terminal membrane anchor with the GT and TP catalytic domains extending into
      the periplasm where they act on lipid II and the nascent peptidoglycan layer.

      This is a very general root-level term that provides minimal information. PBP1A
      is indeed a bifunctional enzyme with both glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase
      activities, but this annotation is too broad to be informative.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >
      This term is overly general and adds no value when more specific molecular
      function annotations (GO:0008955, GO:0009002) are present. The annotation to
      "catalytic activity" provides no meaningful information about what the enzyme
      actually does.

      PBP1A does have peptidase activity via its transpeptidase domain which cleaves
      the D-Ala-D-Ala bond during transpeptidation. However, the primary function is
      transpeptidation (forming new crosslinks) rather than simple proteolysis.

      The proteolytic cleavage of the terminal D-Ala is mechanistically coupled to
      transpeptidation - the acyl-enzyme intermediate is transferred to an acceptor

      but represents a secondary aspect of the core transpeptidase function.

    summary: >
      PBP1A contributes to maintaining cell shape through peptidoglycan synthesis.
      However, this term may be slightly overspecified - PBP1A participates in
      peptidoglycan synthesis which is essential for cell shape, but it is not
      primarily a "regulator" of cell shape. In Pseudomonas, PBP1A mutants show
      morphology/motility defects [Chen et al. 2017].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      The UniProt keyword "Cell shape" maps to this term. The peptidoglycan layer
      synthesized by PBP1A directly determines bacterial cell morphology. In E. coli,
      PBP1B loss decreases cell stiffness [Pazos & Vollmer 2021]. While "maintenance
      of cell shape" might be more precise, this annotation captures the biological
      reality that PBP1A function affects cell morphology. Pseudomonas PBP1A
      disruptions specifically affect morphology [Chen et al. 2017].

suggested_questions:

      What is the specific outer membrane lipoprotein activator for P. putida
      PBP1A - is it LpoA, LpoP, or another family member? E. coli uses LpoA for
      PBP1A and LpoB for PBP1B, while Pseudomonas employs LpoP, but the specific
      pairing with PBP1A in P. putida KT2440 is not established.
  - question: >
      Is P. putida mrcA (PBP1A) individually essential or redundant with mrcB (PBP1B)?
      In E. coli, either can be deleted but not both. In P. aeruginosa, most HMM
      PBPs are individually nonessential. Direct data for P. putida KT2440 is limited.

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >
      Generate clean deletion mutants of mrcA and mrcB in P. putida KT2440 to
      test individual essentiality and redundancy. This would clarify whether
      PBP1A and PBP1B are functionally redundant in this organism as they are in E. coli.
    hypothesis: >
      mrcA and mrcB are individually dispensable but show synthetic lethality when
      both are deleted, similar to E. coli.
  - description: >
      Characterize cell morphology and mechanical properties of mrcA mutants
      under various stress conditions. Based on E. coli data showing stress-dependent
      performance differences between PBP1A and PBP1B, similar studies in P. putida
      would inform functional partitioning.
    hypothesis: >
      mrcA mutants will show altered cell shape or reduced mechanical stability
      under specific stress conditions such as high osmolarity.
