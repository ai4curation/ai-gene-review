## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88C82
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit omega {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00366}; Short=RNAP omega subunit {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00366}; EC=2.7.7.6 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00366}; AltName: Full=RNA polymerase omega subunit {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00366}; AltName: Full=Transcriptase subunit omega {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00366};
- **Gene Information:** Name=rpoZ {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00366}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_5301;
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the RNA polymerase subunit omega family.
- **Key Domains:** DNA-dir_RNA_pol_omega. (IPR003716); Pol_omega/Rpo6/RPB6. (IPR006110); RPB6/omega-like_sf. (IPR036161); RNA_pol_Rpb6 (PF01192)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "rpoZ" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'rpoZ' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **rpoZ** (gene ID: rpoZ, UniProt: Q88C82) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

### [3] CRONOS: the cross-reference navigation server
- Authors: Brigitte Waegele, I. Dunger, G. Fobo, Corinna Montrone, H. Mewes et al.

- Summary: CRONOS, a cross-reference server that contains entries from five mammalian organisms presented by major gene and protein information resources, is developed, which shows that the cross-references are highly accurate.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.686)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

### [4] CellPhoneDB: inferring cell–cell communication from combined expression of multi-subunit ligand–receptor complexes

    > CellPhoneDB stores ligand-receptor interactions, as well as other properties of the interacting partners, including their subunit architecture and gene and protein identifiers. To create the content of the database, four main .csv data files are required: gene_input.csv, protein_input.csv, complex_input.csv and interaction_input.csv (Fig. 4).
    > gene_input Mandatory fields are 'gene_name', 'uniprot', 'hgnc_symbol' and 'ensembl'. This file is critical for establishing the link between the scRNA-seq data and the interaction pairs stored at the protein level. It includes the following gene and protein identifiers: (i) gene name ('gene_name'), (ii) UniProt identifier ('uniprot'), (iii) HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbol ('hgnc_symbol') and (iv) gene Ensembl identifier (ENSG) ('ensembl'). To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

### [5] The USDA-ARS Ag100Pest Initiative: High-Quality Genome Assemblies for Agricultural Pest Arthropod Research

- Summary: It is shown that the Ag100Pest Initiative will greatly expand the diversity of publicly available arthropod genome assemblies and demonstrate the high quality of preliminary contig assemblies, which should help other researchers attain similarly high-quality assemblies.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.675)
    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

    > The database enables searching by gene symbols/names, GenBank accession numbers, UniGene cluster IDs, Swiss-Prot entry names and several unique clone IDs (IMAGE clone IDs, University of Iowa clone IDs, Operon oligo IDs, TAIR IDs and a subset of selected Affymetrix and Agilent IDs).
    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > In this example, the ancestral gene annotation allows us to infer 'cellular response to UV' for all least-diverged orthologs of NEDD4/RSP5 in animals and fungi. Note that different function annotations are inferred to have arisen in different ancestral genes (annotated nodes at left); this results in different inferred annotations across the genes in the family (blue bars indicating gene annotations at right). For instance, all genes in the tree can be inferred to have 'ubiquitin-protein ligase activity', while only a few genes (tetrapod orthologs of human NEDD4 and NEDD4L) can be inferred to have 'sodium channel regulatory activity' (as their targets, specific epithelial sodium channel subunits, apparently evolved first in tetrapods, not shown).
    > FlyBase (15) were supported; for proteins only RefSeq (24) or FlyBase identifiers. In PANTHER 7, we now also support identifiers from Ensembl (23), model organism databases, the International Protein Index (IPI) (25) and UniProt (18). All of these identifiers are obtained through the mapping files provided by UniProt (ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/ current_release/knowledgebase/idmapping/).
    > Pathway diagrams using SBGN PANTHER 7 has adopted the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) standard (26) for the 165 pathway diagrams currently available on the PANTHER website. This standard was recently released at http://sbgn.org and provides a consistent semantics for symbols used in pathway diagrams.

Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > It is well known that protein names are highly ambiguous [45,46]. Researchers working in specific subcommunities tend to develop their own nomenclature, resulting in multiple names for the same protein. Acronyms and abbreviations further complicate the picture. Simply being able to recognize a protein name as such is just a starting point. The name needs then to be unambiguously qualified, by referring to an entry in a standard protein database, such as UniProt http:// www.expasy.org/sprot/ [47].
    > In order for that to happen, the disambiguation must occur at two levels: interspecies (to which specific organisms does the protein mention refer?) and intraspecies (within a given organism, which specific protein is meant?). For example, a protein mentioned in text as eIF4E could refer to a large number of different proteins. A search in the Swiss-Prot section of UniProt (the manually curated section) delivers 46 possible matches. However, if the term appears contextually with the mention of a specific organism, like in the sentence 'The Cap-binding protein eIF4E promotes folding of a functional domain of yeast translation initiation factor eIF4G1' (PubMed: 10409688), then it is reasonable to assume that the name refers to a specific organism (yeast), thus restricting the possible matches in UniProt to the following two: EAP1_YEAST (eIF4E-associated protein 1) and IF4E_YEAST (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E). For the task of protein annotation, we have adopted a high-recall, low-precision term annotation approach, followed by very strict disambiguation steps, which gradually increase precision (at some expense for recall).
    > UniProt contains for each protein a list of frequently used synonyms, as well as the name and synonyms of its encoding gene. We have built a database that maps the synonyms to the protein identifier. We have further enriched such a list using morpho-syntactic rules that generate variants of the synonyms. Starting from the subset of UniProt delivered by the BioCreative organizers (which contained 228,

    > Datasets can be inserted or uploaded to the web interface (Figure 2b). Data must be tab separated and formatted as shown in Figure 3A. They could include gene symbols and UniProt identifiers, which are used for the Gene Ontology annotation feature. To annotate a dataset which contains gene symbols and/ or UniProt identifiers, the appropriate organism can be set (Figure 2d) and the user can choose between full or slim GO annotation (Figure 2e) and full or experimental evidence (Figure 2f). The annotation is based on the gene and UniProt identifiers provided by UniProt-GOA and will be updated monthly.
    > It is essential that the first column contains the experimental value (log fold-change, isotope incorporation, intensity, etc.). Titles of the annotation columns are used to discriminate between different types of annotation in the results. If a pasted dataset already contains annotations such as KEGG and Pfam, these terms must reside in tab separated and titled columns (Figure 3A and online help). Annotations need to be located in the last columns. Importantly, semi-colons must separate multiple identifiers or terms in one column. For example, multiple identifiers are common for protein groups of mass spectrometric data and annotation will be done for all entries. Similarly, multiple terms are also common with Gene Ontology as one gene can be associated with several compartments at the same time and any of these terms will be treated independently. When columns of annotation are provided, the correct number of columns must be set in the respective spin-box in the web interface (Figure 2c). The dataset used in the example analysis already contains three annotation columns (KEGG, Pfam and InterPro) and is available on the web site of the tool as tab separated text file and Excel file (Figure 2a).
    > Regulation or the enrichment based on various statistics (estimators) can be tested depending on the focus of the analysis (Figure 2g). The number of resamplings R can be set in the range from 500 to 10,000 (Figure 2h).

Therefore, to make a fair comparison between organisms, we included all mRBD-containing proteins in our subsequent analysis, irrespective of their annotation. To correct for differences in genome size, RBD abundance was expressed as the number of RBDs per 10,000 genes. Pfam domains that were present in at least one out of 11 organisms (n = 353) were clustered based on their relative abundance across organisms using the k-means clustering algorithm with a maximum of 1000 iterations in R v2.7.0 [70].

    > To obtain basic information on WERs and their target genes, such as official gene symbols, gene IDs, gene types, and genomic locations, gene annotations were downloaded from the GENCODE project [ 44 ] for human and mouse, and from NCBI [ 45 ] and Ensembl [ 46 ] for the other species. Genomic locations were extracted from the corresponding GTF annotation files. Gene symbols were primarily standardized based on the NCBI Gene database [ 45 ] for mRNAs and lncRNAs, GtR-NAdb [ 47 ] for tRNAs, miRbase [ 48 ] for microRNAs, and cir-cBase [ 49 ] for circRNAs. Deprecated or substituted versions of genes were filtered out. The LiftOver [ 50 ] program was employed to convert and unify genomic coordinates across different genome assembly versions.

- Summary: It is demonstrated that for proteins that are characterized by GO, the CSIDOP may predict extra functions, which is attractive as a protein normally executes a variety of functions in different processes and its current GO annotation may be incomplete.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.638)
    > Importantly, the CSIDOP predicted functional annotations for 181 H. sapiens proteins that are not currently described in the GO database. Some of these novel annotations can be supported with evidence provided by QuickGO, a web browser of gene ontology data maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute [37]. For instance, the gene FHL1, four and a half LIM domains protein [Swiss-Prot: Q13642], was identified by the CSIDOP to participate in metal ion binding (GO:0046872) and zinc ion binding (GO:0008270). The metal ion binding annotation was found in QuickGO which was inferred from UniProt keywords. The zinc ion binding term was found by both the UniProt keywords and in InterPro [34], which is a database of protein families, domains and functional sites in which identifiable features found in known proteins can be applied to unknown protein sequences. Many novel functional annotations are supported by evidences found in their orthologous protein annotations. Orthologous proteins are generally believed to have similar functions, and the orthologs can be obtained from Inparanoid [31]. For example, the H. sapiens gene POLA2, DNA polymerase subunit alpha B [Swiss-Prot: Q14181], was predicted by CSIDOP to exhibit alpha DNA polymerase activity (GO:0003889). Orthologs of POLA2 found by Inparanoid include: POL12 [ORF: YBL035C; SGD:S000000131] in S. cerevisiae, POLA2 [RGD:621817] in R. norvegicus, and CG5923 [FlyBase: FBgn0005696] in D. melanogaster. All three orthologs were associated with the alpha DNA polymerase activity (GO:0003889).

- Summary: This work proposed a novel approach for finding the most effective reference model species through taxonomic associations and ultra-conserved orthologous (UCO) gene comparisons among species and showed that the proposed system indeed provides superior performance by selecting appropriate multiple species for transcriptomic analysis compared to traditional approaches.

    > For effective and efficient gene functional analysis in this study, a total of 291 eukaryotic reference model species were verified and selected from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [14], Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) [15], and NCBI RefSeq [16] databases simultaneously. These 291 selected species possess comprehensive gene annotations for functional enrichment analysis. The NCBI RefSeq database contains non-redundant, well-annotated, and curated information for genomic DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, and genomes in RefSeq are copies of selected assembled genomes available in GenBank. This annotated information from RefSeq can be accessed through the BLAST, Entrez, and NCBI FTP sites. In order to utilize functional information from the biological pathway and GO annotations, initial integration with both the KEGG and UniProt databases was performed in advance. We collected all annotated genes and corresponding pathway information for differential expression analysis, in particular for the 291 selected model species. In other words, we collected corresponding GO annotations from UniProt and functional molecular interaction relationships from KEGG. The UniProt database is a freely accessible website that provides comprehensive protein sequences and corresponding high-quality, curated functional annotations. Therefore, we retrieved gene information including the protein ID, gene ID, and corresponding GO annotations for the 291 selected model species from UniProt in advance. The downloaded information from these two databases was integrated by mapping the information to protein IDs and gene IDs indexed by the RefSeq database. We also downloaded the NCBI Taxonomy database, which contains almost all species appearing in the NCBI database and the detailed corresponding positions of these species within the phylogenetic tree. Lineage information for all organisms in this database allows users to select appropriate reference species from among the 291 reference model species. The NCBI Taxonomy database is the standard nomenclature and classification repository for the INSDC, comprising the GenBank, ENA (EMBL), and DDBJ databases [17]. It includes the names and taxonomic lineages of species based on either nucleotide or protein sequences collected in the INSDC databases.

    > The GeneCards (RRID:SCR_002773) database was used to search for reported tendinopathy-related genes by entering keywords of tendon injuries, tendon rupture, tendon healing, and tendon adhesion for target-based drug applications. The potential tendon-healing targets of the active components of SHT matched the potential gene targets of the active ingredients of SHT. According to the UniProt database (https://www.uniprot.org/), the full names of the target proteins were transformed into gene symbols based on the UniProt ID (The UniProt Consortium, 2017) (Figure 1). The database leverages the unique rich combinatorial annotations of GeneCards. The GeneCards database provides direct links to generelated research reagents, such as antibodies, recombinant proteins, DNA clones, and inhibitory RNAs, and lists of gene-related drugs and compounds. GeneCards was used to depict the GeneCards Inferred Functionality Score annotation landscape tool for scoring the functional status of genes (Fishilevich et al., 2016).

    > Interpreting predicted structures requires more than 3D coordinates-biological relevance hinges on understanding function, interactions, and known complex formation. QSProteome integrates data from UniProt, ComplexPortal, and STRING to provide functional context for every uploaded model [ 13 -15 ].
    > At the sequence level, QSProteome retrieves UniProt annotations for each modeled subunit, including gene names, protein function, ligand interactions, and cofactors [ 13 , 22 ]. This information is particularly useful for homo-oligomeric proteins, whose oligomerization state is often unknown and therefore missing from curated complex-level databases. In such cases, gene-level annotations still provide important functional context and reveal well-defined biological roles. Annotated sequence features-such as transmembrane domains-can be directly highlighted on the structure in the Mol * viewer (Fig. 5 A and B).
    > At the complex level, QSProteome integrates data from ComplexPortal, displaying complex names, functions, and biological roles for models that match or overlap with known assemblies (Fig. 5 D). If no direct match is found, QSProteome generates a composite summary from the UniProt annotations of individual subunits.
    > To assess protein-protein interactions, each model page includes an interactive STRING network (Fig. 5 C). This visualization combines experimental evidence and computational predictions to evaluate whether the modeled subunits are likely to form a biologically relevant complex. Users can examine connection confidence, supporting evidence, and interaction types directly within the embedded viewer.
    > By embedding rich biological annotations alongside structural models, QSProteome ensures that users can evaluate both structural integrity and biological relevance. This layered context supports expert interpretation and broadens accessibility to non-specialists seeking functionally meaningful models.
