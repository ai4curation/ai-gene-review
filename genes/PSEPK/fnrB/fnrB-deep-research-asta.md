## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88HX0
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Transcriptional regulator with 4Fe-4S cluster, Crp/Fnr family {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68840.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=fnrB {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68840.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_3233 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68840.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** cNMP-bd_dom. (IPR000595); cNMP-bd_dom_sf. (IPR018490); Env_Response_Regulators. (IPR050397); HTH_CRP. (IPR012318); RmlC-like_jellyroll. (IPR014710)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "fnrB" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'fnrB' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **fnrB** (gene ID: fnrB, UniProt: Q88HX0) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > The protein sequences were functionally annotated by combining information retrieved from the UniProt database ( [25], accessed on 9 June 2022) and one-to-one fast orthology assignments using the eggNOG-mapper v.2.1.7 tool ( [26], accessed on 9 June 2022), as described in [27]. Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > In an effort to engage the collective expertise of the scientific community, we have implemented a collaborative wiki (MediaWiki version 1.19.11) for the Mnemiopsis gene complement. The Mnemiopsis Gene Wiki is accessible from the left sidebar of most pages and is searchable either by selecting a Mnemiopsis gene identifier (e.g., ML00011a) from the drop-down menu or by manually entering an identifier in the appropriate search box. Users can also access these pages by clicking on a gene in the 2.2 track of the genome browser. Each record in the Gene Wiki represents a single Mnemiopsis gene and provides the following annotation: nucleotide and protein sequences, coding exonic genomic coordinates, pre-computed BLAST hits from numerous organisms displaying the top hits for each protein, the top non-self BLAST hit to Mnemiopsis, Pfam-A domains, Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations, human disease genes from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and a table of ortholog clusters formed by phylogenetically informed clustering methods [4] (Figure 5). In addition, controlled editable sections have been included that permit (and encourage) the scientific community to provide further gene annotation for isoforms, in situ images, references, and other notes for each gene. Users interested in supplementing our gene model annotation at the Mnemiopsis Gene Wiki pages must first create an account and log in prior to submitting their contributions. In-house subject matter expert data curators are notified by e-mail following the creation of a new user account or an edit to an existing Gene Wiki record. Any content changes or additions to the Gene Wiki are thoroughly evaluated by these data curators and are made public subject to their approval.
    > Pre-compiled BLAST hits are enumerated in tabular form. Each Mnemiopsis protein was compared to the UniProt and NCBI non-redundant protein databases (nr) using BLASTP. The results display the hit number, the accession numbers, E-values, and brief descriptions of the top four hits (lowest E-values). Accession numbers are linked to relevant corresponding entries at UniProt and GenBank.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > Further the assembled transcript contigs were validated using CLC Genomics workbench (CLC Bio, Boston, MA 02108 USA) by mapping high quality reads back to the assembled transcript contigs. ORF-Predictor [57], an online tool, was used on default parameters to identify the coding DNA sequences (CDS) from assembled transcript contigs. GC counts of transcripts was determined using a custom-made perl script.
    > Functional annotations. The functional annotation was performed by aligning coding DNA sequence (CDS) to NCBI 'green plant database (txid 33090)' database using basic local alignment search tool (BLASTX) [58] with an E-value threshold of 1e -06 and GO assignments were used to classify the functions of the predicted CDS. The GO mapping also provided ontology of defined terms representing gene product properties which were grouped into three main domains: biological process (BP), molecular function (MF) and cellular component (CC). GO mapping was carried out in order to retrieve GO terms for all the BLASTX functionally annotated CDS. The GO mapping used defined criteria to retrieve GO terms for annotated CDS which included use of BLASTX result accession IDs to retrieve gene names or symbols, UniProt IDs and direct search in the dbxref table of GO database. Identified gene names or symbols were then searched in the species specific entries of the gene-product tables of GO database. UniProt IDs made use of protein information resource (PIR) which includes protein sequence database (PSD), UniProt, SwissProt, TrEMBL, RefSeq, GenPept, and PDB databases. Gene Ontology analysis helps in specifying all the annotated nodes comprising of GO functional groups. CDS were compared against the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) database for the analysis of phylogenetically widespread domain families. CDS were compared against Pfam database for higher-level groupings of related protein families, known as clans and the identification of domains that occurs within proteins. BLASTX was used against uniprot-swissprot database with cut-off e-value 1e-6 to annotate predicted CDS against protein.

The FAC-TOR and GENE flat files contain information on transcription factor proteins and genes regulated by transcription factors, respectively. A total of 2362 regulating factors for the human species (Homo Sapiens) were extracted and 70 entries, that did not describe proteins, but other regulatory factors were omitted. A large fraction (about 77 percent) of the remaining 2292 transcription factor proteins were mapped to Uniprot [27], either by external database ID's, or exact matches between protein names. With these accessions the protein coding gene IDs, as well as other information was downloaded automatically via a MATLAB based data retrieval algorithm implemented for this study. The transcript and probeset annotation files for the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array were downloaded from the manufacture's website http://www. affymetrix.com and parsed into MySQL tables. Transcript IDs for 98 percent of the human transcription factor coding genes were extracted based on direct matches between gene names.
    > Genes that can potentially be up regulated when the transcription factor protein binds to a specific site in its promoter region are called transcription factor target genes. We extracted all target genes for human transcription factor proteins by joining a number of database tables. This revealed 3296 gene targets for the 2292 transcription factor proteins. We used direct matches between the target gene names, as well as additional entries, to identify corresponding transcripts on the Affymetrix GeneChip. This resulted in matches for 83 percent of the target genes.

    > we observed reporter gene expression from lines tagging 2 of 3 genes. The lack of expression observed with five of our promoter-reporter lines as well as a gene trap line obtained from CSHL's collection is likely due to either a very low level of expression directed by those promoters, or a very specific pattern, timing, or condition for expression that was not tested by our assays. The pools of cDNA which served as our RACE template originated from several biotic and abiotic treatments that we did not examine in relation to our promoter-reporter constructs.
    > Overall, we verified the expression and structure of 378 un-annotated genes, 27% of which do not display similarity to any annotated proteins. Furthermore, nearly 50% of the genes described herein are most similar to hypothetical proteins or other proteins of unknown function.
    > Examining the putative functional roles of the remaining un-annotated genes, we can begin to speculate the reasons that many were overlooked by previous annotation efforts. Single copy, lowly expressed genes such as the putative alpha 1,-6, mannosyltransferase corresponding to Twinscan prediction At.chr1.1.117, which does not have similarity with other Arabidopsis genes was likely overlooked due to the lack of support from conserved EST sequences. On the other hand, At.chr1.6.385, which encodes a CLAVATA3/ESR related protein and is a member of a divergent multi-gene family, was likely overlooked due to a combination of lack of EST support [30], and a relatively small coding size. Similarly, we have identified members of a large and divergent gene family encoding Cysteine Rich Peptides. The small size and divergent sequences of this family have contributed to their under-representation in the genome annotation [12]. Additionally, approximately 50% of the top protein hits for the newly verified genes are to hypothetical proteins, or other poorly characterized proteins having unknown function and low expression levels. These examples underscore the limitations of gene prediction programs that still rely to a large extent on training sets derived from relatively abundantly expressed proteins.
    > The incorporation of genomic sequence data from related organisms allows for the easier identification of such genes.

    > The NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), include protein sequence information from GenBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), SwissProt, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and Protein Research Foundation (PRF). The NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) are the nucleotide sequence database that includes nucleotide sequence from GenBank of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as cell, organism and ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. KEGG is an established Cluster of Orthologous (KO) annotation system that can accomplish the function annotation of the genome/transcriptome of a newly sequenced species. SwissProt is a manual annotated and reviewed protein sequence database that has a high-quality protein sequence database from experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions. Pfam is comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile of hidden Markov models. Many proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of a specific structural domain possesses a certain degree of conservative property. GO is the established standard for the functional annotation of gene products and controlled vocabulary used to classify the functional attributes of gene products of a biological process, a molecular function and a cellular component.

    > PPND integrates various sequences, annotations, and expression information to provide an efficient search tool for researchers, including the gene, gene family, transcription factor (TF), and protein kinase searches. In subsequent work, we added four additional tool modules: flanking sequence finder, TTL (Transthyretin-like) family [46] finder, pathway map, and miRNA search. Users can enter the gene ID obtained from BLAST or the genome browser into the gene search function to obtain more information. This includes information on the origin of the organism, gene family, KEGG ID, coding sequence, protein sequence, annotation information (site position and annotation source database), and expression data (Figure 4). This information will allow researchers to gain a basic understanding of the gene structure and function. Certain search functionalities, such as the protein kinase search, complement the gene search function. They provide more detailed assistance for researchers with varying levels of bioinformatics analysis expertise. Therefore, PPND provides Pfam links in the gene search function. By linking to InterPro, researchers can access additional information. Using this toolkit, users can also obtain information on the upstream and downstream sequences, functional components, signaling pathways, and miRNA sequences of the target gene. These data can help researchers conduct more in-depth investigations.
    > Gene families are groups of genes derived from a single ancestral gene due to gene duplication events. They usually have high similarity in structure and function and encode similar proteins with shared domains. For example, the MADS-box gene family [47] is involved in plant growth and development, especially flower reproductive development. In PPND, users can search for a gene family by entering the gene family name or Pfam ID and selecting a species. They can also click "↓" to make a selection. The "↓" button will display a random set of 50 members, including the family name and Pfam ID. The platform provides a list of genes from that family along with the option to obtain their sequences in FASTA format (Figure 5). Gene families are groups of genes derived from a single ancestral gene due to gene duplication events. They usually have high similarity in structure and function and encode similar proteins with shared domains.
