## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88QV7
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=PqqA binding protein 1; AltName: Full=Coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein D 1; AltName: Full=Pyrroloquinoline quinone biosynthesis protein D 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=pqqD1; OrderedLocusNames=PP_0377;
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the PqqD family. .
- **Key Domains:** PQQD. (IPR008792); PqqD_bac. (IPR022479); PqqD_sf. (IPR041881); PqqD (PF05402)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "pqqD1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'pqqD1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **pqqD1** (gene ID: pqqD1, UniProt: Q88QV7) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.
    > The protein set for the HeLa spindle proteome is derived from the 1121 accession numbers in Sauer et al. supplementary table 1 column 2 [17]. Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.

Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > A gold standard set of protein functional annotations was generated by extracting data from UniProt [16] and BRENDA [17]. We extracted all protein sequence and annotation data from UniProt (release 2016_05) for the organism Zea mays, keeping the EC annotations only from the manually reviewed component of UniProt, while removing those annotations that had not undergone manual review. We also extracted experimentally verified protein annotations for Zea mays from BRENDA (release 2016.1). The UniProt and BRENDA annotations were then merged by matching proteins based on the database crosslinks provided by BRENDA, resulting in the union of the reviewed annotations from UniProt and the experimentally verified annotations of BRENDA with duplicates removed. The merged protein annotations were then matched to the B73 RefGen_v2 translated gene models using BLASTP based on a sequence identity cutoff of 96% and an e-value cutoff of 1e-20. We selected the top scoring hit for each protein which resulted in matches to 1,815 unique maize proteins. EC annotations for alternate isoforms were consolidated at the gene level, resulting in 1,475 experimentally verified or manually reviewed protein functional annotations across 1,450 maize genes.

Additionally, a fragment of the pyrroloquinoline quinone precursor peptide PQQA was detected. The full list of genes present in each species' symbiosis-associated region and the genes' expression status during symbiosis (as measured by Takeshita and Kikuchi [9]) is provided in Table S2.
    > Of the newly identified proteins, the pyrroloquinoline quinone precursor peptide PQQA did not code for the whole protein and instead was a fragment of approximately 100 bp. Due to the small size, the annotation was found in only 42 of the 53 islands, but when the unannotated regions were searched for on NCBI using BLASTX, the PQQA fragment was found in the remaining 11 genomes with complete islands.

    > As previously described (Triant et al. 2020), once a proteincoding gene annotation is complete, each new or modified isoform should be compared to a well-curated protein sequence database to check for congruency with known proteins. The sequence of an annotation is obtained by right clicking it and selecting Get Sequence. The first choice of database to search is the well-curated UniProtKB/Swissprot database using BLAST at either the UniProt (https:// www. unipr ot. org/ blast) or NCBI website (https:// blast. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ Blast. cgi) (Sayers et al. 2023a;UniProt Consortium 2023). If there is no match with a significant e-value (< 1e−05) in UniProtKB/Swissprot, the next database to try is the Model Organisms (landmark) database at NCBI. If that fails, select the RefSeq Proteins database and exclude your organism of interest from the search. Although RefSeq includes computationally predicted and hypothetical proteins, an alignment to a homologous protein from another organism provides support for the annotation. An alignment that covers the full length of both the annotated protein and the database protein sequence suggests the annotation is correct. An alignment that encompasses the full length of an annotated protein sequence but only part of a database protein suggests that the annotation is truncated. You may be able to correct the annotation with additional evidence, but if there is not sufficient evidence the issue can be noted in the Annotation Information Panel under the Comment tab. A partial alignment of an annotated protein to a database protein suggests the annotation has a reading frame shift or was extended incorrectly. Aligning the coding sequence (CDS) to the protein database will reveal whether the problem is due to a reading frame shift. Further annotation editing should be performed to correct the reading frame. If an incorrect extension was due to the merging of two genes, you should edit or redo the annotation. Any unresolved issues should be entered in the Comment section of the Annotation Information Panel.

    > The BLASTx homology search tool, a component of the standalone NCBI-blast-2.3.0+, was used to perform functional annotation of the F. udum genes (Altschul et al., 1990). With a cut-off E value of ≤1e−06 and a similarity of 34%, BLASTx identified the homologous sequences of the genes in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using Blast2GO PRO 4.1.5 (Conesa and Gotz, 2008). In three different mappings, B2G performed as follows: (1) Using two NCBI-provided mapping files, blast result accessions are used to get gene names (symbols; gene info, gene 2 accessions). (2) Blast result GI identifiers were used to retrieve UniProt IDs using a mapping file from PIR (non-redundant reference protein database), which includes PSD, Swiss-Prot, UniProt, TrEMBL, GenPept, RefSeq, and PDB. The names of the identified genes were searched in the species-specific entries of the gene product table of the GO database. With the aid of the KAAS-KEGG Automatic Annotation Server, pathway analyses were carried out. This database provides functional annotation of genes using other data servers (Moriya et al., 2007). Accessions from the blast results were looked for in the DBXRef table of the GO database.

Overview of KinaseFusionDB and its role in understanding kinase fusion proteins. (a) I. The top section identifies therapeutic targets for oncogenic activation of kinases, including wild-type kinases activated by overexpression or genomic amplification, mutated kinases with gain-offunction mutations, and kinase fusion proteins resulting from chromosomal rearrangements. II. The middle section highlights the functionalities of KinaseFusionDB, such as providing functional annotations, mRNA/protein expression data, drug binding information, and relevant literature reviews. III. The third section addresses the current limitations in targeting kinase fusion proteins, particularly the lack of comprehensive 3D structures for these proteins. It emphasizes the partial knowledge of kinase fusion protein structures and the need for further drug screening. IV. The bottom section discusses how computational approaches, such as predicted 3D structures (e.g. from AlphaFold2), can fill these gaps, supporting drug screening and filtering based on consistent binding among multiple fusion protein isoforms. (b) Kinase domain-retained human kinase fusion proteins.

UniProt provides the loci information of 39 protein features, including 6 molecule processing features, 13 region features, 4 site features, 6 amino acid modification features, 2 natural variation features, 5 experimental info features, and 3 secondary structure features.

    > The UniProt accession identification of target kinases was converted to gene symbols for humans using the SynGO gene set analysis tool (Koopmans et al., 2019), and pooled together, and submitted to GeneMANIA to construct target kinase network. GeneMANIA is a handy web interface for acquiring gene ontology, scrutinizing gene lists, and highlighting genes for functional assays (Warde-Farley et al., 2010). After choosing Homo sapiens from the list of optional organisms, the genes of interest in the previous step were entered into the search bar and the results were collated and high-scored genes were culled for further discussion. Moreover, the protein-protein network was also constructed in STRING ver. 12 launched at https://string-db.org, and submitted to Cytoscape ver. 3.10.2 for network analysis using a novel Cytoscape plugin cytoHubba and visualization (Shannon et al. , 2003).
