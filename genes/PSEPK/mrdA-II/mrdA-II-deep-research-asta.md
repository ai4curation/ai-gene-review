## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88DL8
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Peptidoglycan D,D-transpeptidase MrdA {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02081}; EC=3.4.16.4 {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02081}; AltName: Full=Penicillin-binding protein 2 {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02081}; Short=PBP-2 {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02081};
- **Gene Information:** Name=mrdA-II {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70376.1}; Synonyms=mrdA {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02081}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_4807 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70376.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the transpeptidase family. MrdA subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** Beta-lactam/transpept. (IPR050515); Beta-lactam/transpept-like. (IPR012338); PBP_dimer. (IPR005311); PBP_dimer_sf. (IPR036138); PCN-bd_Tpept. (IPR001460)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "mrdA-II" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'mrdA-II' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **mrdA-II** (gene ID: mrdA-II, UniProt: Q88DL8) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

- Summary: A comprehensive protein localization analysis of essential genes in 27 prokaryotes including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and 1 archaeon has been performed and shows that proteins encoded by essential genes are enriched in internal location sites, while exist in cell envelope with a lower proportion compared with non-essential ones.

    > Bioinformatics Databases. DEG is a database of essential genes (http://www. essentialgene.org/). The newly released DEG 10 has been developed to accommodate the quantitative and qualitative advancements brought by the progressive identification methods. Currently available records of both essential and nonessential genes among a wide range of organisms can be downloaded from DEG 10, making it possible to compare the two different types of genes in many aspects 21 .
    > 27 prokaryotic organisms including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and Methanococcus maripaludis S2, the only record of the Archaea domain were selected to analyze the protein localization and GO distribution of the essential and nonessential genes. There are 31 bacterial records corresponding to 27 organisms in the database in total and 26 sets of data were selected in the current study. Streptococcus pneumonia was not chosen for the lack of non-essential genes. Since the essential genes were not genome-widely identified, it's not reasonable to regard the complementary set of essential genes as non-essential genes in Streptococcus pneumonia 29,30 . In the case of multiple records for one organism, the one with the most convincing experimental methods was chosen. The non-essential genes in Methanococcus maripaludis S2 and 13 bacteria such as Escherichia coli MG1655 are obtained based on the original literatures, while non-essential genes in other 12 organisms such as Bacillus subtilis 168 are the complementary set of essential genes. The information of the organisms used in the current study are displayed in Table 1.
    > The three model genomes' subcellular location information and the Gene Ontology (GO) terms used for the analysis in the current study were downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt; http://www.uniprot.org). Maintained by the UniProt Consortium, UniProt is committed to providing biologists with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and functional annotation 27 . Among the wealth of annotation data, detailed GO annotation statements are included.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.672)
    > A long-term goal of synthetic biology has been the identification of the minimal genome, i.e., the smallest set of genes required to support a living organism. The bacterium with the smallest genome generated to date is based on Mycoplasma mycoides 1 . Its minimal bacterial genome consists of 473 genes including essential genes and a set of genes associated with growth, termed 'quasi-essential' 1 . The minimal genome study assigned function to proteins encoded by the minimal genome by considering matches to existing protein families in the TIGRFAM 2 database, genome context and structural modelling 1 . Proteins were annotated with molecular functions and grouped into 30 biological process categories (including an unclear category, where the biological process was not known). The proteins were further assigned to five classes according to the specificity and confidence of the molecular function annotations that they had been assigned: Equivalog (confident hits to TIGRFAM families), Probable (low confidence match to TIGRFAM families supported by genome context or threading), Putative (multiple sources of evidence but lower confidence), Generic (general functional information identifiable, e.g., DNA binding or membrane protein, but specific function unknown) and Unknown (unable to infer even a general function). The final two confidence classes, Unknown (65 genes) and Generic (84 genes) form the group of genes whose function is unknown. Hence, almost a third (149) of the encoded 473 proteins are of unknown function, which emphasises our limited understanding of biological systems 1 .
    > This lack of functional annotation is not restricted to the minimal bacterial genome. One-third of protein-coding genes from bacterial genomes lack functional annotations 3 . Recent experimental approaches have begun to identify the function of 'hypothetical' proteins of unknown function 4 . However, the continual improvement of high-throughput sequencing methods has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of organisms for which genome sequences are available and the functional annotation of the encoded gene products lags behind 4 . Less than 1% of the 148 million protein sequences in UniProt 5 are annotated with experimentally confirmed functions in the Gene Ontology (GO) 6 (April 2019).

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > The database enables searching by gene symbols/names, GenBank accession numbers, UniGene cluster IDs, Swiss-Prot entry names and several unique clone IDs (IMAGE clone IDs, University of Iowa clone IDs, Operon oligo IDs, TAIR IDs and a subset of selected Affymetrix and Agilent IDs).
    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

The resulting data provided 133,996 unique identifications, which were in turn used to query the Uniprot database. This search returned HHMI Author Manuscript HHMI Author Manuscript HHMI Author Manuscript 109,961 records (including reviewed and unreviewed) along with their functional and structural annotations, including gene ontology features. The annotation table was used to search for mitochondrial evidence associated with a given Uniprot identification in our proximity-labeling anti-biotin-enriched data set by using a string match algorithm. A given protein was annotated as having mitochondrial evidence if any of the following were true: (i) the string 'mitoch' matched the above UniProt annotation table when queried by either gene name or accession number. (ii) The protein showed mitochondrial evidence from a list of mitochondrial proteins which was the same as our previous study (Rhee et al. 11 ) and a precursor to MitoCarta2.0 catalog 28 . (iii) The protein was present in the original mitochondrial true positive list used Rhee et al. 11 . Thebiotinylated peptide data were filtered such that reverse hits, nonhuman contaminants, nonfully localized biotinylation sites, sites identified in the SILAC light state, and redundant biotin site entries were removed. From this list, transmembrane proteins were annotated using the following criteria: (i) the UniProt transmembrane annotation contains the string "TRANSMEM" when matched by either gene name or accession number and/or (ii) evidence from of transmembrane domains after running the precursor MitoCarta2.0 catalog through TMHMM 29 . The UniProt topological domain annotation contained the string "TOPO" when matched by either gene name or accession number.

    > Datasets can be inserted or uploaded to the web interface (Figure 2b). Data must be tab separated and formatted as shown in Figure 3A. They could include gene symbols and UniProt identifiers, which are used for the Gene Ontology annotation feature. To annotate a dataset which contains gene symbols and/ or UniProt identifiers, the appropriate organism can be set (Figure 2d) and the user can choose between full or slim GO annotation (Figure 2e) and full or experimental evidence (Figure 2f). The annotation is based on the gene and UniProt identifiers provided by UniProt-GOA and will be updated monthly.
    > It is essential that the first column contains the experimental value (log fold-change, isotope incorporation, intensity, etc.). Titles of the annotation columns are used to discriminate between different types of annotation in the results. If a pasted dataset already contains annotations such as KEGG and Pfam, these terms must reside in tab separated and titled columns (Figure 3A and online help). Annotations need to be located in the last columns. Importantly, semi-colons must separate multiple identifiers or terms in one column. For example, multiple identifiers are common for protein groups of mass spectrometric data and annotation will be done for all entries. Similarly, multiple terms are also common with Gene Ontology as one gene can be associated with several compartments at the same time and any of these terms will be treated independently. When columns of annotation are provided, the correct number of columns must be set in the respective spin-box in the web interface (Figure 2c). The dataset used in the example analysis already contains three annotation columns (KEGG, Pfam and InterPro) and is available on the web site of the tool as tab separated text file and Excel file (Figure 2a).
    > Regulation or the enrichment based on various statistics (estimators) can be tested depending on the focus of the analysis (Figure 2g). The number of resamplings R can be set in the range from 500 to 10,000 (Figure 2h).

    > 3. Gene annotation and functional annotation. a. Gene structure annotation.
    > In addition to gene prediction models, evidence from orthologous protein sequences and transcriptome assembly could be used to improve annotation quality. Protein sequences of orthologous genes can be obtained from UniProt (The UniProt, 2017). Ones from Swiss-Port have been reviewed and thus are of higher quality. Transcriptome assembly may be available from previous studies or can be assembled de novo from RNA-seq reads by Trinity (Haas et al., 2013). High quality transcriptome assembly can be selected as described in (Zhang et al., 2021). Note: Details about gene structure annotation (Holt and Yandell, 2011) can be found at http:// gmod.org/wiki/MAKER_Tutorial, https://darencard.net/blog/2017-05-16-maker-genomeannotation/, and the protocol (Campbell et al., 2014).
    > b. Quality measurement and functional annotation.
    > For each predicted gene, Maker2 provides the annotation edit distance (AED) score, which measures the goodness of fit between its predicted gene structure and its evidence support. The lower the score, the more accurate the prediction. If more than 90% genes with AED scores lower than 0.5, the genome can be considered well annotated. In addition to the AED score, a high proportion of recognizable domains contained in predicted protein -e.g., higher than 50% -also indicates a good annotation. Recognizable protein domains can by scanned by InterProScan (Jones et al., 2014), assigning potential function to predicted genes.
    > Note: Besides the aforementioned quality measurement, we strongly recommend measuring the completeness of the genome assembly and annotation by checking the existence of a set of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) (Simao et al., 2015). A high-level completeness of genome assembly and annotation is imperative for a better identification of gene expansion. Based on the result of this analysis, researchers can decide whether they need to further improve the genome assembly before predicting gene expansion. A detailed protocol of BUSCO is available at

    > Protein-coding gene annotation is typically a two-step process. Initially, Prodigal is employed to identify open reading frames (ORFs) by locating gene coordinates, but it does not infer gene function. To assign putative functions, Prokka performs hierarchical annotation by comparing candidate genes to curated protein databases. It begins with a user-supplied, high-confidence protein set, using BLAST+ for sequence similarity searches. If no match is found, it progresses to UniProt's verified bacterial proteins, covering \~ 16,000 sequences, and then optionally to RefSeq proteins specific to the organism's genuscapturing nomenclature consistency. When sequence-based annotation fails, Prokka applies profile-based searches using HMMER's hmmscan to query against Pfam and TIGRFAMs databases. An e-value threshold of 10 −6 is consistently applied to ensure significance. If no reliable match is found across all levels, the gene is designated as a "hypothetical protein. " This layered strategy maximizes annotation accuracy and functional insight across diverse bacterial genomes (Seemann, 2014).
    > The genome of coliphage ASEC2201 has been analyzed and three holin protein coding genes were selected. The sequences of all three holin proteins were retrieved from NCBI using accession no. SRX17770782 in the FASTA format. The sequence similarity search was performed via BLAST against the non-redundant database (Altschul et al., 1990).

    > The BLASTx homology search tool, a component of the standalone NCBI-blast-2.3.0+, was used to perform functional annotation of the F. udum genes (Altschul et al., 1990). With a cut-off E value of ≤1e−06 and a similarity of 34%, BLASTx identified the homologous sequences of the genes in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using Blast2GO PRO 4.1.5 (Conesa and Gotz, 2008). In three different mappings, B2G performed as follows: (1) Using two NCBI-provided mapping files, blast result accessions are used to get gene names (symbols; gene info, gene 2 accessions). (2) Blast result GI identifiers were used to retrieve UniProt IDs using a mapping file from PIR (non-redundant reference protein database), which includes PSD, Swiss-Prot, UniProt, TrEMBL, GenPept, RefSeq, and PDB. The names of the identified genes were searched in the species-specific entries of the gene product table of the GO database. With the aid of the KAAS-KEGG Automatic Annotation Server, pathway analyses were carried out. This database provides functional annotation of genes using other data servers (Moriya et al., 2007). Accessions from the blast results were looked for in the DBXRef table of the GO database.
