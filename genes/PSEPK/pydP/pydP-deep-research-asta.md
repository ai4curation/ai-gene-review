## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88FQ2
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=PydP transporter, NCS1 nucleoside transporter family {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN69627.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=pydP {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN69627.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_4035 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN69627.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the purine-cytosine permease (2.A.39) family.
- **Key Domains:** Pur-cyt_permease. (IPR001248); Uracil/uridine/allantoin_perm. (IPR045225); Transp_cyt_pur (PF02133)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "pydP" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'pydP' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **pydP** (gene ID: pydP, UniProt: Q88FQ2) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Functional annotation assignments Gene level searches were performed against protein, domain and profile databases including JCVI in-house non-redundant protein database Panda-AllGroup.niaa, Pfam [13] and TIGRfam [14] HMMs, Prosite [15], and InterPro [16]. In addition, programs to predict membrane localization such as SignalP [17], TMHMM and TargetP [17] were run. After the working gene set had been assigned function, predicted proteins were organized into protein families as previously described [7] with the purpose of refining the annotation in the context of related genes in the genome. Predicted genes were assigned informative names and classified using Gene Ontology (GO) [18]. GO assignments were attributed automatically, based on other assignments from closely related organisms using Pfam2GO, a tool that allows automatic mapping of Pfam hits to GO assignments as well as manually by expert annotators. All assignments were reviewed manually for consistency, on a family based approach, via Manatee, a webbased genome annotation tool that can view, modify, and store annotation for prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Names between OGA and NGA were compared by simple query for corresponding genes to determine the level of change and improvement. Annotation of transporter proteins was performed using TransportDB (http://www.membranetransport.org/) [19].

    > Sequence similarity analyses were accomplished using blastx [26] against the NCBI non-redundant database on protein level [32], the Swissprot database [33,34] and KEGG [35]. Additionally, manual gene annotation was performed using PRIAM [36], Motif Scan [37], Prosite  [38], BRENDA [39,40], UniProt/SwissProt [34], Inter-ProScan [41], and Pfam [42] databases. One example of how our manual annotation differed from that of the automated pipeline used by Brown et al. can be found in the case of CLAU_3519 (CAETHG_3609). Here the automated pipeline from the Brown et al. finished genome assigned this gene product as a hypothetical protein, however when the sequence was aligned using BLASTP as part of our manual curation all other proteins with >75 % identity were named sodium ABC transporter. Upon further inspection in Pfam, one large ABC-2 family transporter protein domain was found (E-value 6.8e-31). Similar searches of UniProt and KEGG databases agreed with Pfam, therefore we annotated this gene product as an ABC-2 family transporter. The correction of the previously short-called homopolymer reads through our sequencing efforts gave a fully annotated finished sequence of C. autoethanogenum without the erroneous frame-shift containing annotations which had occurred previously. Using these tools we were able to manually curate the entire genome to ensure that the automated annotation was correct and to insert additional information where required, as well as implementing a standardised protein product naming system as recommend by the NCBI guidelines [43] for ease of identification of genes with related functions. As a consequence of the automated and subsequent manual curation, we have found 482 instances across the genome where genes previously identified as 'hypothetical protein' have either been assigned a specific function, or have been named through identification of conserved domains based on sequence similarity.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Genes overrepresented for nonsynonymous and structural mutations were classified into functional groups based on the functional annotation table constructed with DAVID v.2023q3 91,92 (Table S4). We established the following rules for generalizing genes into functional groups: Chaperone: genes that encode proteins that perform chaperone or chaperonin-like activities (Uniprot Keyword: KW-0143); Envelope: Genes that encode proteins involved in the maintenance of the cell-envelope such as phospholipid biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0008654) and peptidoglycan biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0000270); Metabolism: Genes that encode proteins involved in general metabolic functions, such as purine metabolism (KEGG: eco00230), amino acid metabolism (KEGG: eco00470, eco00330); or TCA Cycle (KEGG: eco00020); Regulators: Genes that encode proteins directly involved in transcription (GO-BP: 0031564; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0804), translation (GO-BP:0006412, GO-BP:0006413; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0689), or the regulation of transcription (GO-BP: 0006355, GO-BP:2000143, GO-BP:0006353, GO-BP: GO:0045893; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0805); and Transport: Genes that encode proteins involved in transport: such as ABC transporters (Interpro: PR017871), MFS transporters (Interpro: IPR011701); symporters (Interpro: IPR023954, IPR001204, IPR001734, IPR023025, IPR004840), or Antiporters (Interpro: IPR004771).

    > The manual classification process included four steps, which are highlighted in Fig. 1B. Universal protein resource (Uniprot) [28] was used to access annotation information on the dataset by using the unique Ensembl protein identification associated with each protein. Uniprot is a large comprehensive repository of protein sequences with manually curated as well as automatically generated associated annotations. For each protein, the associated UniProt annotations were used in the curation process: gene name, sequence status, review status, Consensus Coding Sequence identifier, Transporter Classification number, Enzyme Commission number, Pfam domain information, Gene Ontology annotation terms, and protein family information.
    > The Uniprot sequence information is derived from translated sequences that have been submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), which is EMBL-bank, GenBank, and DDBJ. The canonical sequence is determined from either the most prevalent, the most similar to orthologous sequences, the properties of the amino acid composition, or in lieu of nothing else, then the longest sequence. The sequence status is defined as either complete or fragment, in which the canonical sequence is missing amino acid residues, often in the initial or terminal ends. Those protein sequences identified as fragments were considered invalid proteins and culled from the dataset. To reduce falsepositive predictions from TOPCONS-single, proteins that were identified in literature or database sources as having less than or greater than four-transmembrane segments were also removed from the dataset.
    > The initial gene annotation source, GenCode, has ~1050 more protein-coding gene entries than the most conservative annotation resource, the Consensus Coding Sequence dataset (CCDS) [64]. Therefore the CCDS identifier was used to assess the validity of each protein, i.e. that each has acceptable transcriptional support and recognized protein-coding annotation. Additionally, the sequence status, CCDS identifier, and sequence length were used to ensure that the predicted protein was the main (or canonical) protein product of the gene and not an isoform. There are eight predicted proteins in the dataset that do not have a CCDS identifier associated with them.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Gene SSU_RS04755 has been predicted to encode a basic membrane family protein (BMP), a transmembrane component of specific ABC transporters. Growth curve experiments did not reveal a significant reduction in the growth rate of our ΔSSU_RS04755 mutant. The operon genes with SSU_RS04755 were predicted to encode an ATPbinding protein and a permease which are typical components of an ABC transporter. Both predicted ATPbinding protein and permease encoding genes appeared as CEGs in our Tn-seq results (Table 1). The protein sequence associated with SSU_RS04755 shares significant identity with lipoproteins that are components of nucleoside ABC transporters in Gram-positive bacteria (see above), suggesting that SSU_RS04755 and its operon genes may encode an ABC transporter complex involved in nucleoside transport. To investigate the possible functional equivalence of SSU_RS04755 operon genes with ABC transporters, we performed amino acid sequence alignments of SSU_RS04755 with PnrA and TmpC, which are homologous nucleoside binding lipoproteins from S. pneumoniae and Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) respectively [49,50]. Using the crystal structure of PnrA binding to adenosine [49], we confirmed that all but one (T70) of the specific amino acids involved in adenosine binding by PnrA were conserved in SSU_RS04755 (Figure 5(c)).
    > To verify if the structural positions of these amino acids were conserved, we performed a structural prediction (see methods) of the predicted S. suis lipoprotein SSU_RS04755 and aligned it to the structure of PnrA (ID 6y9U in Protein Data Bank (PDB). We confirmed that all amino acids involved in the adenosine binding are located at the same position in both protein structures.

    > Given a set of predicted protein-coding genes for a newly sequenced genome, functional annotation involves assigning putative functions to the predicted genes. Two ways in which this can be done are assigning protein names and Gene Ontology (GO;Gene Ontology Consortium, 2010) terms to the predicted proteins. Here we describe a computational pipeline for assigning protein names and GO terms to predicted proteins in parasitic worm (nematode and platyhelminth) genomes, which transfers names and GO terms from orthologues in other species.
    > When assigning protein names, UniProt protein naming rules (www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot) are followed where possible. This recommends that a good and stable name for a protein is "as neutral as possible"; that a protein name "should be, as far as possible, unique and attributed to all orthologs"; and a protein name "should not contain a specific characteristic of the protein, and in particular it should not reflect the function or role of the protein, nor its subcellular location, its domain structure, its tissue specificity, its molecular weight or its species of origin".
    > In our protocol, a protein name is assigned to each predicted protein based on curated names in UniProt (Bairoch & Apweiler, 2000) for human, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schistosoma mansoni orthologues identified from a database of gene families (e.g. built using Ensembl Compara; Vilella et al. 2009), or (if no information is found from orthologues) based on InterPro (Hunter et al. 2012) domains. Figure 1 shows an example of using our protein naming pipeline for four Strongyloides ratti genes that belong to the tubulin polyglutamylase family (underlined in pink), where four different protein names were assigned to them (in pink), based on names of their C. elegans or human orthologues.

    > Further the assembled transcript contigs were validated using CLC Genomics workbench (CLC Bio, Boston, MA 02108 USA) by mapping high quality reads back to the assembled transcript contigs. ORF-Predictor [57], an online tool, was used on default parameters to identify the coding DNA sequences (CDS) from assembled transcript contigs. GC counts of transcripts was determined using a custom-made perl script.
    > Functional annotations. The functional annotation was performed by aligning coding DNA sequence (CDS) to NCBI 'green plant database (txid 33090)' database using basic local alignment search tool (BLASTX) [58] with an E-value threshold of 1e -06 and GO assignments were used to classify the functions of the predicted CDS. The GO mapping also provided ontology of defined terms representing gene product properties which were grouped into three main domains: biological process (BP), molecular function (MF) and cellular component (CC). GO mapping was carried out in order to retrieve GO terms for all the BLASTX functionally annotated CDS. The GO mapping used defined criteria to retrieve GO terms for annotated CDS which included use of BLASTX result accession IDs to retrieve gene names or symbols, UniProt IDs and direct search in the dbxref table of GO database. Identified gene names or symbols were then searched in the species specific entries of the gene-product tables of GO database. UniProt IDs made use of protein information resource (PIR) which includes protein sequence database (PSD), UniProt, SwissProt, TrEMBL, RefSeq, GenPept, and PDB databases. Gene Ontology analysis helps in specifying all the annotated nodes comprising of GO functional groups. CDS were compared against the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) database for the analysis of phylogenetically widespread domain families. CDS were compared against Pfam database for higher-level groupings of related protein families, known as clans and the identification of domains that occurs within proteins. BLASTX was used against uniprot-swissprot database with cut-off e-value 1e-6 to annotate predicted CDS against protein.

    > Protein identifications with 2 peptides and a confident protein score (P <0.05) from the HpH fractionation and IDA-MS were used to assign subcellular localization. Using the top score given by WoLF PSORT [10] (www.genscript.com/wolf-psort.html) proteins were categorized into 8 locations. Membrane proteins were predicted using transmembrane helical Markov model (TMHMM) [11] (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Proteins in the solute carrier protein (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter families were identified according to gene and protein name. We also used website gene names (www.genenames.org/data) to characterise the subcellular location of the transporter and the type of substrate they transport.
    > For proteins annotated as 'uncharacterised' in figures and tables in the manuscript a BLAST protein homology search was carried out using the Ensembl or uniport accession code in uniprotKB (www.uniprot.org). The accession code page contains the sequence and a link to BLAST. BLASTp results against uniprotkb_Swissprot reference proteomes and an identity sequence match of >95.5% to human, bovine (cattle) or caprine (goat) proteome annotation was accepted as the protein name.

For Cydnidae, while egg smearing was reported for some species (87), other species are likely to acquire the symbiont environmentally. For Pentatomidae and Scutelleridae, both egg smearing and environmental transmission may occur (88). S3), we identified 550 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that showed significantly high expression levels in the hindleg of mature females (FDR q < 0.001, Table S6). Functional enrichment analysis revealed an overall up-regulation of genes related to transporter activities in the hindleg of mature females (UniProt Keyword "Transport", P = 2.23e -9 ). The gene category included genes for ABC transporters (25 contigs), facilitated trehalose transporter Tret1 (14 contigs), alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (3 contigs), ammonium transporter Rh type C2, and zinc transporter ZIP8. The enhanced transport activities might reflect the secretory role of the epidermal cells of the hindleg organ, where uptake and secretion of nutrients from hemolymph to mycangial pores must actively occur to foster the fungal growth.
    > As for individual genes, the most highly expressed DEG in the hindlegs of mature females was the gene for a Takeout family protein (TRINITY_DN2609_c0_g2_i2), and another Takeout family gene (TRINITY_DN4168_c0_g2_i1) was also highly expressed (rank 6, Table S6). Takeout family proteins are small secretion proteins that are thought to bind to and transport hydrophobic molecules (18). These proteins may represent the major carriers of hydrophobic materials secreted for the fungi growing on the hindleg organ. We also found that the hindlegs of mature females preferentially expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT, e.g.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > In addition to the systematic experimental verification of novel annotations in three GO categories as described above, here we highlight individual predictions for which we found supporting evidence in the publicly available databases. This information was not available to the classifiers at the time when the models were constructed. The following examples are for E. coli K12, as this is by far the best-studied model prokaryote [21].
    > We predict genes hypC and hybG to have ''nickel cation binding.'' These genes had no GO terms assigned in the 07-02-2012 UniProt-GOA release (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/ P0AAM3 and http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0AAM7), and we therefore considered them unannotated. In the meantime, hypC was annotated with ''metal ion binding'' using experimental evidence: this is a parent GO term of our prediction. Moreover, when examining the literature, we found evidence that these two genes are involved in the biosynthesis of the [NiFe] cluster [22].
    > Another prediction is for gltL: we predicted it is annotated with ''ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complex.'' In line with our predictions, PortEco, a portal that includes information from 14 different E. coli data resources [23], labels the gene as ''ATPbinding component of ABC superfamily.'' Note that more general electronic GO annotations were available for this gene, e.g. ''ATP binding,'' ''ATPase activity,'' and ''ATP catabolic process'' (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0AAG3).
    > A similar prediction of a more detailed function is for ybgI, where we predict GO terms from both BP and MF ontologies. This gene is known to be a conserved metal-binding protein [24], having an electronic GO annotation ''metal ion binding''; we predict it is annotated with the BP GO term ''Mo-molybdopterin cofactor metabolic process.''

    > BLAST analysis returned significant similarities (e-value cutoff , = 10 25 ) with other protein-coding genes for a small fraction of assembled genes. Table 3 reports the results obtained against the three major protein databases, UNIPROT, NCBI non redundant (nr) and eggNOG. UNIPROT more frequent BLAST hits were against human sequences (16%), Mus musculus (15%), Ratus novergicus (9%) and Drosophila melanogaster (5%). The reproducibility of results in different databases highlights the robustness of the analysis. However, almost 71% of unigenes were not annotated in BLAST searches with protein sequences from the NCBI nr database (FASTA sequences and the annotation text file can be downloaded at http://goo.gl/DZt7K8). We identified several key genes for gene-environment relationships such as cytochrome P450, proteins involved in the toll-like receptors signaling pathway, glutathione S-transferase (GST), gammaglutamil-transpeptidase (GGT) and adhesive proteins Mepf1 (9 unigenes) and Mepf2 (103 unigenes) (Table S2 in supporting information presents the KEGG Orthology identifiers (KO) and the unigenes IDs). For a more straightforward analysis, Table 4 shows the quantity of unigenes annotated as cellular defensesrelated genes through BLAST searches against C. gigas protein sequences (Table S5 presents L. fortunei IDs for genes in Table 4).
    > A total of 3,612 L. fortunei unigenes were classified into 20 of 24 functional categories at eggNOG database (Figure 2). KO identifiers were assigned to 2,579 unigenes, indicating involvement in 292 different pathways (Table S2). These sequences could be assigned to specific KEGG classes: 39.8% to genetic information processing (GIP); 34.3% to metabolism (with enzymes being the most abundant subcategory, 368 unigenes) and 11.5% to Signaling and cellular processes, including cytoskeleton proteins and transporters.

    > To obtain comprehensive gene function information, we performed gene function annotation using eight major databases, including UniProt [23], KEGG [24] and KEGG Pathway, GO [25], Pfam [26], COG [27], TIGERfams [28], RefSeq, and NR. The predicted gene sequences were aligned against functional databases such as COG, KEGG, UniProt, and RefSeq using BLAST+ (Version: 2.11.0+), resulting in the gene function annotation outcomes. The statistical results of the annotations are shown in Table S2. Among the top 20 domains annotated based on Pfam, we observed that genes belonging to "ABC transporters" were the most abundant (Figure 2A). As we know, ABC transporters comprise a large superfamily of proteins that facilitate the translocation of a diverse array of substrates, including ions and macromolecules, across cellular membranes through ATP binding and hydrolysis. Furthermore, these transporters are also critically involved in the cellular uptake and efflux of numerous organic pollutants [29,30]. These results suggest that the abundance of ABC transporter genes provides Paracoccus sp. P-2 with a significant capacity for deltamethrin transport. As shown in Figure 2B, the genes annotated by KEGG are divided into 5 major categories and 23 minor subcategories. Among them, the subcategory with the largest number of genes is metabolic pathways, which include amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, among others. The abundance of genes related to metabolic pathways provides the fundamental basis for the survival and deltamethrin degradation capability of Paracoccus sp. P-2. It is worth noting that a substantial number (254) of membrane transporter genes have been annotated in the genome of Paracoccus sp. P-2. Pollutants are often adsorbed onto the microbial membrane surface and subsequently internalized into the cells-a process in which membrane transporter proteins play a crucial role [31]. This abundance of transporter genes highlights the strain's strong capacity for pollutant transport.

    > However, the peaks were in different positions within the gene in the four individual experiments performed (Fig. 6), and no specific binding site within the mRNA could be identified from the data.
    > Among the genes identified were numerous genes related to protein biosynthesis (tRNAs, tRNA-aminoacyl synthetases, tRNA-modifying enzymes, ribosomal proteins). As an example, genes for ribosomal proteins were highly represented with 18 out of the 22 genes (82%) for small ribosomal proteins, (12 after cold shock, 55%), and 31 out of 34 genes (91%) for large ribosomal subunit proteins (22 after cold shock, 65%). Other protein families represented were chaperones (e.g., dnaK, dnaJ, grpE, but not dafA, groES, groEL, clpB), cold-shock and general stress proteins (TT_RS08235, _09210; hsp22, hsp30; uspA), topoisomerase genes (gyrA, gyrB, topA), genes for transporters and their subunits (often both the gene for the substrate-bind-ing protein and for the permease, for example, branchedchain amino acid ABC transporter, TT_RS01115 and _01120), and genes related to sugar-and cell wall metabolism and cell division, as well as CRISPR-related genes. In many cases, genes for all subunits of protein complexes (e.g., genes for cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II; clpA, clpX coding for the ClpAX protease) were present.

    > To construct the data set, we extracted 4,775 transporter-substrate pairs with experimental evidence from the Gene Ontology (GO) database [25] and 15,864 data points from the UniProt database that were labeled as manually reviewed [2]. After removing 2,633 duplicates of data points present in both databases, the resulting merged data set consisted of 18,006 unique transporter-substrate pairs with UniProt IDs for the transporters and ChEBI IDs for the substrates.
    > The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) [26] is another database containing functional information for transport proteins. Examining a random sample of literature sources listed in TCDB entries, we noticed that many assigned protein functions have not been validated experimentally. To further investigate the quality of the TCDB data, we extracted 18,051 transporter-substrate pairs with UniProt IDs from the TCDB, covering 11,799 different proteins. Proteins in the UniProt database have been assigned annotation scores that range from 1 to 5 and provide a measure of accuracy of the protein annotation; the extraction of transporter-substrate pairs from UniProt described above considered only those with score 5. In constrast, over 50% of UniProt IDs extracted from the TCDB have a UniProt annotation score of 2 or below (S1 Fig) , indicating a lack of experimental evidence for many TCDB entries. To ensure high data quality, we thus did not use data from TCDB.
    > For the binary task of predicting whether a given molecule is a substrate for a transporter, we mapped all substrates in the data set to InChI (International Chemical Identifier) [27] and SMILES [28] strings, which are textual identifiers of the structure of chemical substances. Some of the substrates could not be mapped, e.g., because their ChEBI IDs were referring to general molecule typess-such as sugar, ion, or protein-instead of specific molecules. We removed the corresponding data points, 78% of which were extracted from the UniProt database and 22% from the GO Annotation database. Furthermore, we removed all ~7,500 transporter-substrate pairs with a proton as a substrate.
