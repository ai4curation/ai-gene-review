## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88LY0
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Membrane fusion protein (MFP) family protein {ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU365093};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_1797 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN67416.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the membrane fusion protein (MFP) (TC 8.A.1)
- **Key Domains:** Beta-barrel_AprE. (IPR058982); HH_AprE-like. (IPR058781); MFP. (IPR050739); T1SS_HlyD. (IPR010129); Beta-barrel_AprE (PF26002)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_1797" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_1797' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_1797** (gene ID: PP_1797, UniProt: Q88LY0) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > The protein sequences were functionally annotated by combining information retrieved from the UniProt database ( [25], accessed on 9 June 2022) and one-to-one fast orthology assignments using the eggNOG-mapper v.2.1.7 tool ( [26], accessed on 9 June 2022), as described in [27]. Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > The lists of proteins used for the comparison contain more items than listed previously due to expansion out of gene clusters, for example, to allow the updating and comparison of current HGNC gene symbols. These lists of proteins were compared in Microsoft Excel 2011 using PivotTable.
    > The protein set for the CHO midbody was derived from the accession numbers in Table S1 and Table S2 from Skop et al. [9]. Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.
    > The protein set for the HeLa spindle proteome is derived from the 1121 accession numbers in Sauer et al. supplementary table 1 column 2 [17]. Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.

Overview of KinaseFusionDB and its role in understanding kinase fusion proteins. (a) I. The top section identifies therapeutic targets for oncogenic activation of kinases, including wild-type kinases activated by overexpression or genomic amplification, mutated kinases with gain-offunction mutations, and kinase fusion proteins resulting from chromosomal rearrangements. II. The middle section highlights the functionalities of KinaseFusionDB, such as providing functional annotations, mRNA/protein expression data, drug binding information, and relevant literature reviews. III. The third section addresses the current limitations in targeting kinase fusion proteins, particularly the lack of comprehensive 3D structures for these proteins. It emphasizes the partial knowledge of kinase fusion protein structures and the need for further drug screening. IV. The bottom section discusses how computational approaches, such as predicted 3D structures (e.g. from AlphaFold2), can fill these gaps, supporting drug screening and filtering based on consistent binding among multiple fusion protein isoforms.

    > In an effort to engage the collective expertise of the scientific community, we have implemented a collaborative wiki (MediaWiki version 1.19.11) for the Mnemiopsis gene complement. The Mnemiopsis Gene Wiki is accessible from the left sidebar of most pages and is searchable either by selecting a Mnemiopsis gene identifier (e.g., ML00011a) from the drop-down menu or by manually entering an identifier in the appropriate search box. Users can also access these pages by clicking on a gene in the 2.2 track of the genome browser. Each record in the Gene Wiki represents a single Mnemiopsis gene and provides the following annotation: nucleotide and protein sequences, coding exonic genomic coordinates, pre-computed BLAST hits from numerous organisms displaying the top hits for each protein, the top non-self BLAST hit to Mnemiopsis, Pfam-A domains, Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations, human disease genes from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and a table of ortholog clusters formed by phylogenetically informed clustering methods [4] (Figure 5). In addition, controlled editable sections have been included that permit (and encourage) the scientific community to provide further gene annotation for isoforms, in situ images, references, and other notes for each gene. Users interested in supplementing our gene model annotation at the Mnemiopsis Gene Wiki pages must first create an account and log in prior to submitting their contributions. In-house subject matter expert data curators are notified by e-mail following the creation of a new user account or an edit to an existing Gene Wiki record. Any content changes or additions to the Gene Wiki are thoroughly evaluated by these data curators and are made public subject to their approval.
    > Pre-compiled BLAST hits are enumerated in tabular form. Each Mnemiopsis protein was compared to the UniProt and NCBI non-redundant protein databases (nr) using BLASTP. The results display the hit number, the accession numbers, E-values, and brief descriptions of the top four hits (lowest E-values). Accession numbers are linked to relevant corresponding entries at UniProt and GenBank.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

    > To obtain basic information on WERs and their target genes, such as official gene symbols, gene IDs, gene types, and genomic locations, gene annotations were downloaded from the GENCODE project [ 44 ] for human and mouse, and from NCBI [ 45 ] and Ensembl [ 46 ] for the other species. Genomic locations were extracted from the corresponding GTF annotation files. Gene symbols were primarily standardized based on the NCBI Gene database [ 45 ] for mRNAs and lncRNAs, GtR-NAdb [ 47 ] for tRNAs, miRbase [ 48 ] for microRNAs, and cir-cBase [ 49 ] for circRNAs. Deprecated or substituted versions of genes were filtered out. The LiftOver [ 50 ] program was employed to convert and unify genomic coordinates across different genome assembly versions.

    > HymenopteraMine provides a report for each entity in the database. Each report is divided into sections including 'Summary', 'Gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Protein', 'Function', 'Homology', 'Others' or a subset of those categories, depending on the identifier searched. For example, searching a protein identifier would provide sections relevant to proteins. Each section of the report provides information in the form of a table that can be customized and downloaded in various formats. The Summary section of a Gene Report provides gene identifiers, symbols, description, organism, chromosome, strand and other identifiers such as aliases (identifiers from previous OGS versions) and database cross references. The Transcripts section provides information about the gene model (transcripts, exons, coding sequences) and gives a visual representation of the gene model highlighting the structure of the gene. Users can download FASTA-formatted sequences for each type of feature provided in the gene model section. Links are provided to JBrowse and to NCBI gene pages, when applicable. Transcript identifiers are linked to Transcript Reports, which include a Gene Expression section that provides raw read counts, normalized read counts, FPKM and RPKM values for RNAseq data with SRA metadata. The Protein section of the Gene Report includes protein name, accession and length. The protein name/accession numbers are linked to Protein Reports, with more information including protein family, GO annotations, InterPro domains, related publications, protein features, and curated notes from UniProt describing tissue specificity, function and developmental stages. The Function section provides GO annotation with evidence codes from the Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component ontologies. Clicking on the symbols to the right of each GO term leads to the directed acyclic graph showing all parents and children of the term, developed using the BioJS DAG Viewer (50). Clicking on a GO term provides a report for that term, a list of genes annotated with that term and tables showing relationships to other GO terms. The Homologue sec-tion lists homologues in other hymenopteran species and Drosophila melanogaster. The 'Other' section provides publications and a list of overlapping features.

    > From ~8,000 fusion genes, we selected in-frame fusion genes using the annotations from the TCGA Fusion Gene Data Portal. Specifically, we selected fusion genes whose reading frames were not disrupted by the breakpoints; this resulted in 2,782 in-frame fusion genes. Next, we identified the TFs and their partner pairs using the 1,307 human TFs and their target gene dataset as described above. This process led to 232 TFs that involved 386 fusion events. To survey the TF domain retention, we downloaded the protein domain annotation information for the 232 TFs from the UniProt database, using the UniProtKB search module [49]. Because the protein domain information was based on amino acid sequence, we converted the genomic break point information into the amino acid sequence by considering all UniProt protein accessions, transcript isoforms, and multiple break points for each TF. To map protein domain loci onto the human genome, we used the RefSeq gene model of human reference genome (hg19) from the UCSC Genome Browser [50,51]. For the fusion genes whose 5'-partner genes were TFs (5'-TFFGs), we considered the protein domain being retained in the fusion if the break points were at the 3'-end of the functional domain. Similarly, for the fusion genes whose 3'-partner genes were TFs (3'-TFFGs), we considered the protein domain being retained if the break points occurred at the 5'-end of the functional domain. We also examined functional domain retention in fusion genes whose 5'-and 3'-partners were both TFs (5'-3'-TFFGs). As a result, we obtained 148 TFFGs with 109 TFs. These were 81 5'-TFFGs, 59 3'-TFFGs, and 10 5'-3'-TFFGs involving 52, 51, and 19 unique TFs, respectively. All annotations that included protein domains on the amino acid sequence for each fusion gene are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

First, the identified protein identity was converted to UniProt identity and then mapped to GO identity based on the protein identity. When the identified protein was not annotated by UniProt-GOA, the functional annotation of that protein was conducted using the InterProScan software according to the amino acid sequence alignment approach. All proteins were then classified into 3 groups: molecular function, cellular component and biological process.

    > To identify genes for which no information at all is available, we filtered the database for genes with features drawn from knowledge-base-specific phrase lists that corresponded to genes with no other functional information. For example, 'Putative uncharacterized' often appeared in such UniProt entries. As another example, EcoCyc genes with no information have summaries that begin with this phrase 'No information about this'. (e.g. 'No information about this protein was found by a literature search conducted on 23 February 2017' for ybiU). The full list of phrases that were used can be found in Dataset S5. When genes were annotated only with a protein domain or family, we still included them in the list because such domains (e.g. DUF1479 for ybiU) often themselves have no functional information associated (DUF1479 has the description 'Protein of unknown function' on Pfam: https: //pfam.xfam.org/family/PF07350).

    > Gene nomenclature contains current official symbols and various numbers of synonyms, which pose a challenge to integrating genomic data and increase the probability that different genes share the same symbol. Therefore, we retrieved identifiers assigned to all protein-coding genes in human, mouse, rat and pig genomes that are available in the Ensembl genome browser (release 113) to assess the number of genes, compare species and identify ambiguous symbols. Results: Our analysis revealed that the total number of symbols, both official symbols and synonyms, used to identify protein-coding genes ranges from 16,600 in pigs to 64,580 in mice. Furthermore, the gene nomenclature is not complete because there are also genes without an assigned symbol, which indicates gaps in understanding protein-coding genes, especially in pigs. We also found a large number of gene symbols that map to more than one gene. These symbols might complicate the identification of about 10% of rat and mouse genes and 18% of human protein-coding genes. A simple solution for this problem is the usage of stable gene IDs assigned by scientific institutions and committees (Ensembl, NCBI, RGD, HGNC and VGNC) provided that the genomic information associated with these IDs is retrieved directly from proprietary databases containing the most accurate data. Finally, although gene symbols may pose a problem with unequivocal identification of genes, there are instances when no other identifiers are available in the literature. Therefore, we have developed an R script performing search of the Ensembl database and integrating data to provide a single list of updated symbols with annotation about their ambiguity. Conclusions: Gene symbols are not always reliable and should be reported together with stable IDs to enable unequivocal identification of genes. Therefore, data containing only gene symbols should be used cautiously to avoid misidentification of genes. A solution for this problem is our R script REgeness that performs a gene symbol update to current official versions combined with identification of ambiguous symbols and retrieval of other IDs from the Ensembl database.
