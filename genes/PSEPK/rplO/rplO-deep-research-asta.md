## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88QL6
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Large ribosomal subunit protein uL15 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01341}; AltName: Full=50S ribosomal protein L15 {ECO:0000305};
- **Gene Information:** Name=rplO {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01341}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_0473;
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the universal ribosomal protein uL15 family.
- **Key Domains:** Ribosomal_uL15. (IPR030878); Ribosomal_uL15/eL18. (IPR021131); Ribosomal_uL15/eL18_sf. (IPR036227); Ribosomal_uL15_bact. (IPR005749); Ribosomal_uL15_CS. (IPR001196)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "rplO" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'rplO' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **rplO** (gene ID: rplO, UniProt: Q88QL6) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > However, the peaks were in different positions within the gene in the four individual experiments performed (Fig. 6), and no specific binding site within the mRNA could be identified from the data.
    > Among the genes identified were numerous genes related to protein biosynthesis (tRNAs, tRNA-aminoacyl synthetases, tRNA-modifying enzymes, ribosomal proteins). As an example, genes for ribosomal proteins were highly represented with 18 out of the 22 genes (82%) for small ribosomal proteins, (12 after cold shock, 55%), and 31 out of 34 genes (91%) for large ribosomal subunit proteins (22 after cold shock, 65%). Other protein families represented were chaperones (e.g., dnaK, dnaJ, grpE, but not dafA, groES, groEL, clpB), cold-shock and general stress proteins (TT_RS08235, _09210; hsp22, hsp30; uspA), topoisomerase genes (gyrA, gyrB, topA), genes for transporters and their subunits (often both the gene for the substrate-bind-ing protein and for the permease, for example, branchedchain amino acid ABC transporter, TT_RS01115 and _01120), and genes related to sugar-and cell wall metabolism and cell division, as well as CRISPR-related genes. In many cases, genes for all subunits of protein complexes (e.g., genes for cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II; clpA, clpX coding for the ClpAX protease) were present.
    > A systematic gene ontology analysis using the DAVID server 6.7 (https://david-d.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) (Huang da et al. 2009a,b) with the consolidated gene lists for Hera1/Hera2, and Hera3/Hera4, translated into UniProt accession numbers, revealed three annotation clusters with significant enrichment (Supplemental Table 4a,b).

    > (Huang da et al. 2009a,b) with the consolidated gene lists for Hera1/Hera2, and Hera3/Hera4, translated into UniProt accession numbers, revealed three annotation clusters with significant enrichment (Supplemental Table 4a,b). Under normal-growth conditions, the most enriched cluster (enrichment score 11.4) comprised genes related to ribonucleoproteins, ribosomes, ribosomal proteins, and translation. The second-most enriched cluster (enrichment score 3.8) comprised genes belonging to protein biosynthesis and tRNA metabolism, including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. A third cluster (enrichment score 2.2) comprised genes related to nucleotide-binding proteins. Among the genes with peaks under cold-shock conditions, the same three annotation clusters were identified, with enrichment scores 6.5, 4.1, and 2.5, respectively.
    > We also analyzed the genes identified under both normal-growth and cold-shock conditions, only under normal-growth conditions, or only under cold-shock conditions. (Supplemental Table 4c-e). The same three annotation clusters (ribosome and translation, tRNA metabolism, and nucleotide binding, enrichment scores 6.4, 3.8, and 2.7, respectively) were reported for genes that contained peaks under both normal-growth and cold-shock conditions. Genes with peaks only under normal-growth conditions were enriched for genes related to ribosomes and translation, genes with peaks only under cold-shock conditions showed no specific enrichment. Genes that neither contained a peak under normal-growth nor under coldshock conditions also showed no significant enrichment of a particular family of proteins (Supplemental Table 4f).
    > As an example for genes related to annotation cluster 1, 18 out of the 22 genes (82%) for proteins of the 30S ribosomal subunit were identified under normal-growth conditions, 12 (55%) after cold shock (11 common genes, three without peaks). For the proteins of the 50S ribosomal subunit, the picture was similar: Out of 34 genes, 31 (91%) were identified under normal-growth, 22 (65%) under coldshock conditions (20 common genes, one without peaks).

    > Genes were identified using Prodigal [18] as part of the DOE-JGI genome annotation pipeline [19]. The predicted CDSs were translated and used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information non-redundant database, UniProt, TIGR-Fam, Pfam, KEGG, COG, and InterPro database. These data sources were combined to assert a product description for each predicted protein. tRNAScanSE was used to find tRNA genes and rRNA genes were found using searches against models of the ribosomal RNA genes built from SIVLA [20,21].
    > Additional gene prediction analysis and functional annotation was performed within the IMG-ER platform [22,23]. For each gene discussed in this publication, the annotation was manually checked against the Gen-Bank® databased manual searches using the BLASTn and BLASTp algorithms -both of the gene from T. tepidarius and using the equivalent gene from members of the Acidithiobacillia or Escherichia coli.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

### [4] Identification of 12 New Yeast Mitochondrial Ribosomal Proteins Including 6 That Have No Prokaryotic Homologues*

- Summary: It is shown that a subset of the newly described ribosomal proteins are localized in mitochondria and are required for the respiratory competency of the yeast cells, bringing to 26 the total number of proteins described as components of the mitochondrial small Ribosomal subunit.

    > However, this name does not allow one to discriminate between small and large subunit proteins and thus may be misleading. For example, Mrp2 is not the homologue of the prokaryotic S2 ribosomal proteins but belongs to the S14p family. Accordingly, we preferred to designate the newly identified genes RSMxx genes, where RSM stands for ribosomal small subunit of mitochondria, and xx is the number of the corresponding prokaryotic protein family (see Table II). The genes that encode proteins that are not significantly similar to prokaryotic proteins were named with the same prefix RSM followed by a number that begins with 22, because there are 21 prokaryotic small ribosomal subunit protein families. Thus, the proposed name of the YKL155c gene is RSM22 (Table II). The matched peptide has the sequence VT-PGSLYK. The differences between the masses of the marked peaks correspond to the masses of amino acid residues Gly, Pro, and Thr. D, the fragmentation spectrum for the peptide that is found within residues 400 -408 in the predicted sequence of Ygl129c shows a very good signal-to-noise ratio. Fragmentation spectra that were generated for other peptides show a signal-to-noise ratio between the two extremes shown in C and D.
    > A large amount of functional data was generated in the course of genetic screenings and functional genomic studies in yeast. Hence, for a number of the identified proteins, some cellular or functional data were already available in public data bases. In addition, for some of the less well characterized proteins, we analyzed the cellular localization of the GFP C-terminally tagged proteins and the respiratory competency of strains disrupted for the corresponding genes. These data are summarized in Table II and described below.
    > Functional Data on the New Proteins That Belong to Known Ribosomal Protein Families-Ribosomal protein families S7p and S10p are represented in yeast mitochondria by the corresponding homologues Yjr113c and Ydr041w. Mammalian homologues of S7 (19) and S10 (20) were also recently described as components of the bovine small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > To get comprehensive gene function of rambai genes, gene annotation to seven databases, namely National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein sequences (NR), NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome Ortholog (KO), SwissProt, Protein family (Pfam), Gene Ontology (GO) and Cluster of Orthologous Groups (KOG), was used as reference.
    > The NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), include protein sequence information from GenBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), SwissProt, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and Protein Research Foundation (PRF). The NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) are the nucleotide sequence database that includes nucleotide sequence from GenBank of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as cell, organism and ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. KEGG is an established Cluster of Orthologous (KO) annotation system that can accomplish the function annotation of the genome/transcriptome of a newly sequenced species. SwissProt is a manual annotated and reviewed protein sequence database that has a high-quality protein sequence database from experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions. Pfam is comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile of hidden Markov models. Many proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of a specific structural domain possesses a certain degree of conservative property. GO is the established standard for the functional annotation of gene products and controlled vocabulary used to classify the functional attributes of gene products of a biological process, a molecular function and a cellular component.

    > In transcriptomics and proteomics studies, one important step of data analysis is the functional annotation of obtained lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or proteins (DEPs). With the increase in the number of organisms with sequenced and annotated genomes, such studies have been performed in many different species. However, the information about gene and protein functions, on which the annotation is based, is mainly derived from a limited number of model organisms or well-annotated species, such as mouse, humans and rat representing mammalian species or even from bacteria, yeast, worms or Drosophila. Based on the assumption that orthologous genes carry out identical or biologically equivalent functions in different organisms, functional annotation is transferred from wellstudied organisms to less well-annotated species (1). Whereas orthologous genes usually have maintained the same function during evolution (2) paralogous genes originated from gene duplication events and often evolved different functions (3,4). Orthologous genes usually have the same gene symbol and name for almost all corresponding species (5, 6). However, depending on the status of the gene annotation of a species, not all annotated genes have an official gene symbol (only locus number, e.g. LOC100152218 60S ribosomal protein L23a-like) and/or are assigned to functional annotation databases like their corresponding orthologs in the well-annotated model organisms. This leads to a substantial loss of information if the gene identifiers (IDs) of the respective species are used for functional annotation. To avoid this data loss and improve the results of functional annotation, one strategy is to transfer information from homologous genes (orthologs and paralogs) of well-annotated species (6).
    > In many situations with non-model species such as livestock species, experimentalists avoid the additional work to assign human ortholog genes for functional annotation analysis and are not aware of the information loss.

    > (ii). Annotation of Protein-Coding Genes Among the 33 ORFs encoding proteins with predicted functions were: nine encoding NADH dehydrogenase subunits, one encoding cytochrome b, three encoding cytochrome C oxidase subunits, five encoding ATP synthase subunits, four responsible for cytochrome C maturation, nine encoding ribosomal proteins, and two with other functions (matR and mttB; Table 1, Figure 2). Among these, the cox2, rps3, nad1, nad5, and rpl2 genes were characterized with potential mutations due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The rpl2 sequence from the VIK32, line MlS-1 mtDNA showed identity with exon 2 of the chloroplast gene encoding ribosomal protein L2. For example, it showed identity with an exon of the line MlS-1 chloroplast gene rplB (OR674883.1; coordinates 78,587-79,084; Cover 69%, Identity 98.3%) (Figure 3), as well as with exon 2 of the chloroplast gene rpl2 from M. lupulina (OM681370.1; Cover 72%, Identity 98.4%) and M. truncatula cultivar Jemalong A17 (MT965675.1; Cover 72%, Identity 97.5%). This sequence also showed high similarity to sequences from the chloroplast genomes of phylogenetically distant plants from the genera Trigonella, Melilotus, Lathyrus, and Pisum (Cover 97%, Identity 95.6-96.2%). The 45 protein-coding genes were characterized as genes encoding hypothetical proteins (Figure 2).

We searched using the longest representatives for each gene in the C. shasta þ NHP assembly (23,418 contigs; IIR-RBT6) then parsed matches (bit score > 100) and posteriorly classified homologs to proteases or motility genes matching the specific databases. We then selected only genes with the same annotation in UniProt (determined using the same standards: no ambiguous terms filtering, bit score > 100) to confirm gene identity. Due to disagreements between annotations (CMKB vs. UniProt, and MEROPS vs. UniProt), we curated gene lists manually, removing genes that matched one or more of the following criteria: 1) no genetic distances available (only available for reference); 2) disagreements between annotations from the different databases, after checking for synonyms or function similarity; 3) annotations that contained terms from UniProt "Uncharacterized protein" and "Predicted protein" (ambiguous terms), and whose identity could not be confirmed; and 4) annotations that contained nonspecific terms, such as "heat shock protein" or "ribosomal protein."

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

Predicted gene models exhibiting strong evidence by exon alignment were exported as protein sequences and coding nucleotide sequences (CDS). Predicted gene models lacking evidence from exon alignment were discarded in downstream analyses. To determine function, the protein sequences were used as input for InterProScan 5RC6 (Jones et al. 2014) (parameters: -dp -f -t p -iprlookup -pa -goterms) and were also compared to the manually curated protein data set from UniProt/Swiss-Prot by blastp v. 2.2.28+. The results in XML format from blastp v. 2.2.28+ and InterProScan were loaded into Blast2GO v. 2.7.1 (Conesa et al. 2005) and merged to create an annotation table (available from the first author on request). The gene models with BLAST hits having e-value of less than 1.0E -100 and mean similarity hit of ≥ 70% were assumed to be orthologs and they were given names following recommended conventions (http:// www.uniprot.org/docs/proknameprot).

    > gene_input Mandatory fields are 'gene_name', 'uniprot', 'hgnc_symbol' and 'ensembl'. This file is critical for establishing the link between the scRNA-seq data and the interaction pairs stored at the protein level. It includes the following gene and protein identifiers: (i) gene name ('gene_name'), (ii) UniProt identifier ('uniprot'), (iii) HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbol ('hgnc_symbol') and (iv) gene Ensembl identifier (ENSG) ('ensembl'). To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > Protein-coding gene annotation is typically a two-step process. Initially, Prodigal is employed to identify open reading frames (ORFs) by locating gene coordinates, but it does not infer gene function. To assign putative functions, Prokka performs hierarchical annotation by comparing candidate genes to curated protein databases. It begins with a user-supplied, high-confidence protein set, using BLAST+ for sequence similarity searches. If no match is found, it progresses to UniProt's verified bacterial proteins, covering \~ 16,000 sequences, and then optionally to RefSeq proteins specific to the organism's genuscapturing nomenclature consistency. When sequence-based annotation fails, Prokka applies profile-based searches using HMMER's hmmscan to query against Pfam and TIGRFAMs databases. An e-value threshold of 10 −6 is consistently applied to ensure significance. If no reliable match is found across all levels, the gene is designated as a "hypothetical protein. " This layered strategy maximizes annotation accuracy and functional insight across diverse bacterial genomes (Seemann, 2014).

    > Many of the 49 essential proteins used to construct our tree are those involved in translation, but not all (25 of them are not). The point of our study was to find genes that were conserved across the breadth of bacterial phyla so they could be used in a study such as this. Other studies have solely used ribosomal proteins, e.g., [8], or ad hoc methods of identifying the selected genes or proteins for inclusion. We identified the 49 proteins in a systematic manner. In some studies, researchers analyzed a much smaller set of related taxa (i.e., more closely related) and, thus, could use a more diverse set of proteins. However, we were specifically searching for a set of proteins that can be used for bacteria in all recognized phyla. It is not surprising to find ribosomal proteins to be widely conserved, as the ribosome, composed of a small and large subunit, is the basic unit for protein translation, a task common to all organisms [40][41][42][43][44][45]. The 30S ribosomal subunit is composed of 24 small proteins and one molecule of ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) [40]. The 50S large subunit contains two rRNA molecules (23S and 5S rRNA) and 33 proteins [41]. The proteins shared by 94% of the bacteria in our study are a subset of those predicted as part of the minimal gene content of the last universal common ancestor in previous studies [46,47] and are in agreement with other studies on the minimal gene set that were published between 1995 and 2016 [48][49][50]. Of the 122 proteins shared by >94% of the organisms in our dataset, 42 were 30S or 50S ribosomal proteins. Given that ribosomal proteins are among the most highly conserved of all proteins, these results are not surprising.

    > The ultimate goal of the functional annotation process (Figure 4) is to assign biologically relevant information to predicted polypeptides, and to the features they derive from (e.g. gene, mRNA). This process is especially relevant nowadays in the context of the NGS era due to the capacity of sequencing, assembling, and annotating full genomes in short periods of time, e.g. less than a month. Functional elements could range from putative name and/or symbols for protein-coding genes, e.g. ADH to its putative biological function, e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase, associated gene ontology terms, e.g. GO:0004022, functional sites, e.g. METAL 47 47 Zinc 1, and domains, e.g. IPR002328, among other features. The function of predicted proteins can be computationally inferred based on the similarity between the sequence of interest and other sequences in different public repositories, e.g. BLASTP against Uniprot. Caution should be taken when assigning results merely based on sequence similarity as two evolutionary independent sequences which share some common domains could be considered homologs 62 . Thus, whenever possible, it is better to use orthologous sequences for annotation purposes rather than simply similar sequences 63 . With the growing number of sequences in those public repositories, it is possible to perform various searches and combine obtained results into a consensus annotation. The accurate assignment of the functional elements is a complex process, and the best annotation will involve manual curation.
    > There are two main outcomes of the functional annotation process. The first is the assignment of functional elements to genes. Downstream analysis of these elements allow further understanding of specific genome properties, e.g. metabolic pathways, and similarities compared with closely related species. The second result of the functional annotation is the additional quality check for the predicted gene set. It is possible to identify problematic and/or suspicious genes by the presence of specific domains, suspicious orthology assignment and/or absence of other functional elements, e.g. functional completeness.

    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.
