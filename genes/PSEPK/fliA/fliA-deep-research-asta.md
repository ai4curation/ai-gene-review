## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88EW1
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=RNA polymerase sigma factor FliA {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00962}; AltName: Full=RNA polymerase sigma factor for flagellar operon {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00962}; AltName: Full=Sigma F {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00962}; AltName: Full=Sigma-28 {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00962};
- **Gene Information:** Name=fliA {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00962, ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN69920.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_4341 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN69920.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the sigma-70 factor family. FliA subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** RNA_pol_sigma-70_dom. (IPR014284); RNA_pol_sigma70. (IPR000943); RNA_pol_sigma70_r2. (IPR007627); RNA_pol_sigma70_r3. (IPR007624); RNA_pol_sigma70_r4. (IPR007630)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "fliA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'fliA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **fliA** (gene ID: fliA, UniProt: Q88EW1) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > The database enables searching by gene symbols/names, GenBank accession numbers, UniGene cluster IDs, Swiss-Prot entry names and several unique clone IDs (IMAGE clone IDs, University of Iowa clone IDs, Operon oligo IDs, TAIR IDs and a subset of selected Affymetrix and Agilent IDs).
    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > The GeneCards (RRID:SCR_002773) database was used to search for reported tendinopathy-related genes by entering keywords of tendon injuries, tendon rupture, tendon healing, and tendon adhesion for target-based drug applications. The potential tendon-healing targets of the active components of SHT matched the potential gene targets of the active ingredients of SHT. According to the UniProt database (https://www.uniprot.org/), the full names of the target proteins were transformed into gene symbols based on the UniProt ID (The UniProt Consortium, 2017) (Figure 1). The database leverages the unique rich combinatorial annotations of GeneCards. The GeneCards database provides direct links to generelated research reagents, such as antibodies, recombinant proteins, DNA clones, and inhibitory RNAs, and lists of gene-related drugs and compounds. GeneCards was used to depict the GeneCards Inferred Functionality Score annotation landscape tool for scoring the functional status of genes (Fishilevich et al., 2016).

    > The flat files FACTOR and GENE of the commercially available database TRANSFAC v2008_2 [26] were downloaded and parsed into a MySQL database. The FAC-TOR and GENE flat files contain information on transcription factor proteins and genes regulated by transcription factors, respectively. A total of 2362 regulating factors for the human species (Homo Sapiens) were extracted and 70 entries, that did not describe proteins, but other regulatory factors were omitted. A large fraction (about 77 percent) of the remaining 2292 transcription factor proteins were mapped to Uniprot [27], either by external database ID's, or exact matches between protein names. With these accessions the protein coding gene IDs, as well as other information was downloaded automatically via a MATLAB based data retrieval algorithm implemented for this study. The transcript and probeset annotation files for the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array were downloaded from the manufacture's website http://www. affymetrix.com and parsed into MySQL tables. Transcript IDs for 98 percent of the human transcription factor coding genes were extracted based on direct matches between gene names.
    > Genes that can potentially be up regulated when the transcription factor protein binds to a specific site in its promoter region are called transcription factor target genes. We extracted all target genes for human transcription factor proteins by joining a number of database tables. This revealed 3296 gene targets for the 2292 transcription factor proteins. We used direct matches between the target gene names, as well as additional entries, to identify corresponding transcripts on the Affymetrix GeneChip. This resulted in matches for 83 percent of the target genes.

    > Notably, only one target gene was identified for HrdB although it is presumed to be responsible for transcriptional initiation of the majority of housekeeping genes. As activities of some sigma factors are controlled by posttranslational modification such as proteolysis or acetylation or additional factors such as RbpA, those sigma factors may be inactive or only partially functional without such modifications or factors [24][25][26] . Indeed, multiple forms of SigH, SigR, BldN and HrdB have been identified from cell extracts of S. coelicolor A3(2) and S. griseus 4,23,27,28 .
    > Modulation of sigma factor activities by proteolysis. Because posttranslational modification plays a role in activating some sigma factors, the activities of sigma factors were further tested using protein variants presumed to mimic posttranslationally modified sigma factors. Some sigma factors possess an extra N-or C-terminal extension that prevents or limits RNA polymerasebinding or promoter recognition activity. Further analysis of protein domain organisations revealed that 17 sigma factors possessed an additional N-or C-terminal extension (> 100 amino acid residues). As the activity of these 17 sigma factors may be negatively affected by these extensions, genes encoding truncated  versions of these 17 sigma factors were cloned. Of them, 4 truncated sigma factors were successfully purified including three sigma factors of which full-length counterparts were also analysed by RIViT-seq (Supplementary Table 2). Using RIViT-seq, at least one target gene was identified for three truncated sigma factors (Table 1; Supplementary Tables 14-16). Greater numbers of genes were directly transcribed by the truncated versions of all three sigma factors than their full-length counterparts, suggesting that the N-or C-terminal extensions exert negative effects on RNA polymerase activity. The number of genes transcribed by SCO2742 substantially increased by removing the C-terminal extension. However, this modification only marginally (about 1.5 times) increased the transcriptional initiation activity of SCO2742 as judged by the fold change between SCO2742_ΔC and SCO2742, suggesting that the C-terminus of SCO2742 may be involved in only fine tuning the activity (Fig. 3a).

    > In bacteria, alterations in gene expression are often controlled at the transcriptional level through changes in associations between the catalytic core of RNA polymerase and the different sigma factors present in a bacterial cell [1]. RNA polymerase is the enzyme responsible for recognizing appropriate genes under specifi c environmental conditions, and for creating the mRNA transcripts that can be translated into new proteins. Sigma factors are dissociable subunits of prokaryotic RNA polymerase. When a sigma factor associates with a core RNA polymerase to form RNA polymerase holoenzyme, it directs the holoenzyme to recognize conserved DNA motifs called promoter sites (or regions) that precede gene sequences. Sigma factors also contribute to DNA strand separation, which is a critical step in transcription initiation. The sigma subunit dissociates from the RNA polymerase core enzyme shortly after transcription begins, thus becoming available for reassociation. Associations between different alternative sigma factors and core RNA polymerase essentially reprogram the ability of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme to recognize different promoter sequences and express entirely new sets of target genes. As the set of genes controlled by a single sigma factor (also known as the regulon) can number in the hundreds, sigma factors provide effective mechanisms for simultaneously regulating large numbers of prokaryotic genes.
    > Sigma factors are classifi ed into two structurally unrelated families: σ 54 and σ 70 families. Subunits comprising the σ 54 family are often commonly referred to as σ N . σ N has been identifi ed in multiple diverse species, including Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, and L. monocytogenes. In addition to regulating nitrogen metabolism in a number of organisms, σ N -dependent genes also contribute to a diverse array of metabolic processes [2,3]. The σ 70 family, which is larger and more diverse than the σ 54 family, is divided into four groups based on conservation of their primary sequences and structures [4,5]. The Group I sigma proteins are the primary sigma factors (e.g., Bacillus subtilis σ A ) and are also referred to as "housekeeping" sigma factors, as they direct transcription of genes important for bacterial growth and metabolism.

    > Critical and absolutely necessary for gene transcription is the RNA polymerase and sigma factors that ensure specific promoter recognizing by the RNA polymerase. The Francisella RNA polymerase is composed of two α subunits, the β, β and ω subunits (rpoA1, rpoA2, rpoB, rpoC, rpoZ, respectively) [30]. Francisella contains two rpoA genes that encode two non-identical α subunits, which are able to form both a heterodimer and a homodimer [30,56]. In addition, Francisella contains at least two sigma factors. The major sigma factor σ 70 is encoded by the rpoD gene and an alternative sigma factor, which is a homolog of the σ 32 heat-shock family proteins, is encoded by the rpoH gene [30,57]. Transcripts of several genes were observed to have increased level of expression during heat shock (Hsp40, GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, ClpB, ClpX, ClpP, and HtpG), and six of them were found to be more abundant during overproduction of RpoH in the live vaccine strain (LVS) (Hsp40, HptG, DnaK, DnaJ, GroES, and GroEL) [57], which are proteins included in the heat stress response and are designated as heat-shock proteins (HSP) [57]. The HSP proteins are under direct regulation of RpoH in E. coli [58], suggesting the same model of gene regulation during heat shock conditions in F. tularensis subsp. holarctica LVS [57]. The response to heat shock is crucial for intracellular bacteria such as Francisella. Most of the RNA-polymerase-regulated genes are required for intracellular growth and full virulence of F. novicida [124]. Probably the most important of them is ClpB [125] that directly interacts with DnaK, which is under RpoH control, [59] and a strain defective for the clpB gene is an auspicious candidate as a live vaccine strain [126,127].

    > Datasets can be inserted or uploaded to the web interface (Figure 2b). Data must be tab separated and formatted as shown in Figure 3A. They could include gene symbols and UniProt identifiers, which are used for the Gene Ontology annotation feature. To annotate a dataset which contains gene symbols and/ or UniProt identifiers, the appropriate organism can be set (Figure 2d) and the user can choose between full or slim GO annotation (Figure 2e) and full or experimental evidence (Figure 2f). The annotation is based on the gene and UniProt identifiers provided by UniProt-GOA and will be updated monthly.
    > It is essential that the first column contains the experimental value (log fold-change, isotope incorporation, intensity, etc.). Titles of the annotation columns are used to discriminate between different types of annotation in the results. If a pasted dataset already contains annotations such as KEGG and Pfam, these terms must reside in tab separated and titled columns (Figure 3A and online help). Annotations need to be located in the last columns. Importantly, semi-colons must separate multiple identifiers or terms in one column. For example, multiple identifiers are common for protein groups of mass spectrometric data and annotation will be done for all entries. Similarly, multiple terms are also common with Gene Ontology as one gene can be associated with several compartments at the same time and any of these terms will be treated independently. When columns of annotation are provided, the correct number of columns must be set in the respective spin-box in the web interface (Figure 2c). The dataset used in the example analysis already contains three annotation columns (KEGG, Pfam and InterPro) and is available on the web site of the tool as tab separated text file and Excel file (Figure 2a).
    > Regulation or the enrichment based on various statistics (estimators) can be tested depending on the focus of the analysis (Figure 2g). The number of resamplings R can be set in the range from 500 to 10,000 (Figure 2h).

    > There are several knowledge bases that represent the collected knowledge of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome: EcoCyc (11), EcoGene (12), UniProt (13) and RefSeq (14). Other useful knowledge bases cater to specific classes of gene products, such as the RegulonDB, which contains manually curated functional information about transcription factors in E. coli (15). Our initial review of these knowledge bases yielded conflicting information on gene function and level of annotation for many E. coli genes. Any attempt to systematically assess the function of unannotated genes must therefore draw from multiple knowledge bases and resolve these conflicts.
    > Many research groups have categorized E. coli genes and proteins by annotation quality as a part of their studies. In 2009, Hu et (16). First, they identified all unannotated proteins in the K-12 W3110 and MG1655 genomes. In order for a protein-encoding gene to be considered functionally uncharacterized in their analysis, it had to meet the following criteria: (i) The gene name begins with 'y', (ii) the gene does not have a known pathway within EcoCyc and (iii) the gene does not have a functional description in Gen-ProtEC (17) (any gene with a description containing the words 'predicted', 'hypothetical', or 'conserved'). Based on these criteria, it was determined that 1431 of 4225 protein coding sequences were not functionally annotated. In 2015, Kim et al. published a database called EcoliNet that curated and predicted cofunctional gene networks for every protein coding gene in the E. coli genome (18). This study also quantified the number of uncharacterized protein coding genes in E. coli. To assess functional annotation, they used the presence of experimentally supported 'biological process' annotations in the Gene Ontology database (19). They concluded that ∼2000 protein coding genes in E. coli were not functionally annotated. The most comprehensive effort to assess the level of annotation in bacterial genomes has been Computational Bridges to Experiments (COM-BREX) (20,21).

    > Although this is a fairly obvious requirement, it is not trivial to implement because a protein reagent expressed recombinantly is typically not the exact same entity or in the same state as its corresponding assay participant in a living cell (e.g., kinase domain binding assay vs. corresponding kinase occurring in a specific cell line used for a growth inhibition assay). In this first version of metadata standards, we take a rudimentary approach. We use the UniProt accession and approved Gene symbol (NCBI Gene) and accession number to identify and reference proteins and their coding genes, respectively. Although we recognize limitations, for the purpose of our current simple use cases, this is sufficient. Linking protein and gene identifiers in addition is relevant to integrate RNAi reagent gene targets (see below). The recommended explicit fields for proteins include a standardized name, both for the protein and the gene that encodes it; source of protein (e.g., chemically synthesized, purified from natural source, recombinantly expressed); protein modifications (e.g., mutations, posttranslational modification); protein purity; subunit information for components of a protein complex; and isoform information (derived from either alternative promoter usage, alternative splicing, alternative translation initiation, or frame shifting). We are currently working on a formal description of proteins that will allow ambiguity (more-or less-specific definition of proteins), because in some cases, the exact entity and state of a protein reagent or model system participant is not definitively known (full length, functional domain, exact sequence, mutation, phosphorylation state, etc.).

This can be achieved using different types of small RNA molecules, including siRNA, shRNA, and miRNA.

    > It is possible that the current gene annotation is incorrect and that these genes were mislabeled as "RNA binding." Out of all 64 manually added genes, nine genes contained weak to very weak RBDs (median E-value = 0.041), of which five were strongly related to the gene annotation. Diversification of these genes in P. falciparum may have precluded identification of these domains in our HMM search.
    > The type of molecule that the candidate RBP interacts with was determined based on existing annotations and known functions of homologs in other species. If this information was not available, the type of molecule was predicted based on the nature of the RNA-binding domain (RBD). Proteins for which no information was available were categorized as "non-RNA."
    > To calculate the percentage of sequences from groups of organisms in the HMM seed, the HMM seed file (Pfam version 27.0) was downloaded, filtered for the 372 mRNAbinding domains used in this study, and parsed for UniProt accession numbers. The source organism of each sequence was then retrieved using the retrieve/ID mapping tool on the UniProt website (http://www.uniprot.org/ uploadlists/) and matched to the corresponding Pfam domain. For each domain, the percentage of sequences derived from each group at the third level of the taxonomic lineage was determined.
    > In each organism, a variety of proteins that are unlikely to be involved in RNA metabolism were identified in the HMM search. However, manually curating these protein lists would introduce a bias, since not all genomes have been annotated to the same extent. Therefore, to make a fair comparison between organisms, we included all mRBD-containing proteins in our subsequent analysis, irrespective of their annotation. To correct for differences in genome size, RBD abundance was expressed as the number of RBDs per 10,000 genes. Pfam domains that were present in at least one out of 11 organisms (n = 353) were clustered based on their relative abundance across organisms using the k-means clustering algorithm with a maximum of 1000 iterations in R v2.7.0 [70].

    > As previously described (Triant et al. 2020), once a proteincoding gene annotation is complete, each new or modified isoform should be compared to a well-curated protein sequence database to check for congruency with known proteins. The sequence of an annotation is obtained by right clicking it and selecting Get Sequence. The first choice of database to search is the well-curated UniProtKB/Swissprot database using BLAST at either the UniProt (https:// www. unipr ot. org/ blast) or NCBI website (https:// blast. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ Blast. cgi) (Sayers et al. 2023a;UniProt Consortium 2023). If there is no match with a significant e-value (< 1e−05) in UniProtKB/Swissprot, the next database to try is the Model Organisms (landmark) database at NCBI. If that fails, select the RefSeq Proteins database and exclude your organism of interest from the search. Although RefSeq includes computationally predicted and hypothetical proteins, an alignment to a homologous protein from another organism provides support for the annotation. An alignment that covers the full length of both the annotated protein and the database protein sequence suggests the annotation is correct. An alignment that encompasses the full length of an annotated protein sequence but only part of a database protein suggests that the annotation is truncated. You may be able to correct the annotation with additional evidence, but if there is not sufficient evidence the issue can be noted in the Annotation Information Panel under the Comment tab. A partial alignment of an annotated protein to a database protein suggests the annotation has a reading frame shift or was extended incorrectly. Aligning the coding sequence (CDS) to the protein database will reveal whether the problem is due to a reading frame shift. Further annotation editing should be performed to correct the reading frame. If an incorrect extension was due to the merging of two genes, you should edit or redo the annotation. Any unresolved issues should be entered in the Comment section of the Annotation Information Panel.

    > The scientific community has recently witnessed the publication of several large eukaryotic genomes in various stages of completion, including the human genome [1,2], the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [3], the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster [4], and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana [5,6]. Each of these genomes contains over 10,000 genes, and as scientists attempt to study these genes more closely, the need for accurate gene models becomes increasingly apparent. For high-throughput genome sequencing projects, equally rapid high-throughput genome annotation is necessary, and bioinformaticists use a variety of computational methods to generate this annotation. Despite many improvements in recent years, these computational methods still fall short of producing correct models for every gene. In order to improve the annotation and facilitate further research, it is essential that we develop methods to identify genes correctly.
    > Annotation of a gene model should include a precise description of where the genomic DNA sequence is transcribed into messenger RNA, the positions in the mRNA of any and all introns, and the translated protein sequence of the gene. If alternative splice variants are present, these should be annotated as well. Computational methods for genome annotation have several shortcomings that result in the following errors in annotation.
    > Gene prediction programs predict exon boundaries correctly only about 80% of the time, even for the most intensively studied organisms [7][8][9]. Thus a gene with five exons will be completely correct only 0.8 5 = 33% of the time, and genes with more exons will be even less likely to be correct. Gene prediction programs also tend to merge and split gene models. Thus two real genes may be merged into one predicted transcript, or vice versa. In addition, programs to align genomic DNA to protein sequences often miss small exons, especially when the homologous proteins are not well conserved. Annotation protocols also tend to miss short genes.
