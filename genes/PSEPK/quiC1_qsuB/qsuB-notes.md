# qsuB Gene Review Notes

## Colleague Question
**Contact**: metabolic@doe.gov
**Key Interest**: Aromatic compound degradation pathways

## Key Findings

### Function: 3-Dehydroshikimate Dehydratase
- Part of quinate/shikimate catabolism pathway
- Converts 3-dehydroshikimate to protocatechuate
- Essential for aromatic compound degradation
- Found through BLAST search (no native C. glutamicum qsuB)

### Molecular Mechanism
1. **Catalytic activity**:
   - Dehydration reaction (lyase)
   - Mg²⁺-dependent catalysis
   - Produces protocatechuate
   - Links to central aromatic degradation

2. **Pathway context**:
   - Quinate → dehydroquinate → dehydroshikimate
   - QsuB: dehydroshikimate → protocatechuate
   - Protocatechuate enters β-ketoadipate pathway

3. **Structural features**:
   - Similar to AroD/AroZ family
   - Metal binding site for Mg²⁺
   - Conserved active site residues

## Environmental Importance
- Plant-derived aromatic degradation
- Lignin breakdown pathway component
- Bioremediation applications
- Carbon cycling in soil

## GO Annotation Review
- IDA evidence for dehydratase activity (PMID:27706847)
