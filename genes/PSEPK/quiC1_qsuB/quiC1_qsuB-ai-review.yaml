  label: Pseudomonas putida KT2440
description: "QuiC1 is a 635-amino acid 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.118) that catalyzes the conversion of 3-dehydroshikimate to protocatechuate (3,4-dihydroxybenzoate), a key reaction in quinate and shikimate degradation pathways. This enzyme is structurally distinct from previously characterized DSDs, consisting of a fusion of two domains: an N-terminal sugar phosphate isomerase-like domain that confers DSD activity, and a C-terminal hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase-like domain important for optimal activity. The enzyme requires divalent metal cations (preferentially Co2+) and functions as a homodimer. QuiC1 represents a novel structural variant of dehydroshikimate dehydratases found in pseudomonads, with applications in metabolic engineering for protocatechuate production."
