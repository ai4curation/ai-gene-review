## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88FH2
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=NADH-quinone oxidoreductase subunit G; EC=7.1.1.-; AltName: Full=NADH dehydrogenase I subunit G; AltName: Full=NDH-1 subunit G;
- **Gene Information:** Name=nuoG; OrderedLocusNames=PP_4124;
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the complex I 75 kDa subunit family.
- **Key Domains:** 2Fe-2S_ferredoxin-like_sf. (IPR036010); 2Fe-2S_ferredoxin-type. (IPR001041); Mopterin_OxRdtase. (IPR006656); Mopterin_OxRdtase_4Fe-4S_dom. (IPR006963); NADH_UbQ_OxRdtase_75kDa_su_CS. (IPR000283)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "nuoG" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'nuoG' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **nuoG** (gene ID: nuoG, UniProt: Q88FH2) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > However, the peaks were in different positions within the gene in the four individual experiments performed (Fig. 6), and no specific binding site within the mRNA could be identified from the data.
    > Among the genes identified were numerous genes related to protein biosynthesis (tRNAs, tRNA-aminoacyl synthetases, tRNA-modifying enzymes, ribosomal proteins). As an example, genes for ribosomal proteins were highly represented with 18 out of the 22 genes (82%) for small ribosomal proteins, (12 after cold shock, 55%), and 31 out of 34 genes (91%) for large ribosomal subunit proteins (22 after cold shock, 65%). Other protein families represented were chaperones (e.g., dnaK, dnaJ, grpE, but not dafA, groES, groEL, clpB), cold-shock and general stress proteins (TT_RS08235, _09210; hsp22, hsp30; uspA), topoisomerase genes (gyrA, gyrB, topA), genes for transporters and their subunits (often both the gene for the substrate-bind-ing protein and for the permease, for example, branchedchain amino acid ABC transporter, TT_RS01115 and _01120), and genes related to sugar-and cell wall metabolism and cell division, as well as CRISPR-related genes. In many cases, genes for all subunits of protein complexes (e.g., genes for cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II; clpA, clpX coding for the ClpAX protease) were present.
    > A systematic gene ontology analysis using the DAVID server 6.7 (https://david-d.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) (Huang da et al. 2009a,b) with the consolidated gene lists for Hera1/Hera2, and Hera3/Hera4, translated into UniProt accession numbers, revealed three annotation clusters with significant enrichment (Supplemental Table 4a,b).

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

The 23 kDa subunit of the human mitochondrial respiratory complex I is 72% identical to the Rhodobacter capsulatus nuoI counterpart [21]. Furthermore, the phyre2 web server predicted the spatial structure of the protein encoding by gene monascus_4971, and the result showed that it was almost same as the spatial structure of protein 6gcsI with 100% confidence and 80% coverage (Figure 1). In fact, the protein data bank showed that 6gcs (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the respiratory complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica (Candida lipolytica), and 6gcsI (229 aa, 25.68 kDa) is the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain I (https: //www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/6gcs/protein/9 (accessed on 10 October 2018)), and the domain homologous to the gene nuim (UniProtKB-Q9UUT8, 33-229 aa, coverage: 83%) encoding NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase 23 kDa subunit (https://www.uniprot.org/ uniprot/Q9UUT8 (accessed on 1 May 2020)).

    > The ultimate goal of the functional annotation process (Figure 4) is to assign biologically relevant information to predicted polypeptides, and to the features they derive from (e.g. gene, mRNA). This process is especially relevant nowadays in the context of the NGS era due to the capacity of sequencing, assembling, and annotating full genomes in short periods of time, e.g. less than a month. Functional elements could range from putative name and/or symbols for protein-coding genes, e.g. ADH to its putative biological function, e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase, associated gene ontology terms, e.g. GO:0004022, functional sites, e.g. METAL 47 47 Zinc 1, and domains, e.g. IPR002328, among other features. The function of predicted proteins can be computationally inferred based on the similarity between the sequence of interest and other sequences in different public repositories, e.g. BLASTP against Uniprot. Caution should be taken when assigning results merely based on sequence similarity as two evolutionary independent sequences which share some common domains could be considered homologs 62 . Thus, whenever possible, it is better to use orthologous sequences for annotation purposes rather than simply similar sequences 63 . With the growing number of sequences in those public repositories, it is possible to perform various searches and combine obtained results into a consensus annotation. The accurate assignment of the functional elements is a complex process, and the best annotation will involve manual curation.
    > There are two main outcomes of the functional annotation process. The first is the assignment of functional elements to genes. Downstream analysis of these elements allow further understanding of specific genome properties, e.g. metabolic pathways, and similarities compared with closely related species. The second result of the functional annotation is the additional quality check for the predicted gene set. It is possible to identify problematic and/or suspicious genes by the presence of specific domains, suspicious orthology assignment and/or absence of other functional elements, e.g. functional completeness.

    > In addition to gene prediction models, evidence from orthologous protein sequences and transcriptome assembly could be used to improve annotation quality. Protein sequences of orthologous genes can be obtained from UniProt (The UniProt, 2017). Ones from Swiss-Port have been reviewed and thus are of higher quality. Transcriptome assembly may be available from previous studies or can be assembled de novo from RNA-seq reads by Trinity (Haas et al., 2013). High quality transcriptome assembly can be selected as described in (Zhang et al., 2021). Note: Details about gene structure annotation (Holt and Yandell, 2011) can be found at http:// gmod.org/wiki/MAKER_Tutorial, https://darencard.net/blog/2017-05-16-maker-genomeannotation/, and the protocol (Campbell et al., 2014).
    > b. Quality measurement and functional annotation.
    > For each predicted gene, Maker2 provides the annotation edit distance (AED) score, which measures the goodness of fit between its predicted gene structure and its evidence support. The lower the score, the more accurate the prediction. If more than 90% genes with AED scores lower than 0.5, the genome can be considered well annotated. In addition to the AED score, a high proportion of recognizable domains contained in predicted protein -e.g., higher than 50% -also indicates a good annotation. Recognizable protein domains can by scanned by InterProScan (Jones et al., 2014), assigning potential function to predicted genes.
    > Note: Besides the aforementioned quality measurement, we strongly recommend measuring the completeness of the genome assembly and annotation by checking the existence of a set of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) (Simao et al., 2015). A high-level completeness of genome assembly and annotation is imperative for a better identification of gene expansion. Based on the result of this analysis, researchers can decide whether they need to further improve the genome assembly before predicting gene expansion. A detailed protocol of BUSCO is available at

Formate dehydrogenase subunit genes are found in A-plasma, I-plasma, Fer1, and Fer2 genomes within molybdopterin synthesis gene clusters. Formate dehydrogenase is a MOB-DN-utilizing enzyme. In silico protein modeling provided additional evidence for the formate dehydrogenase annotation of these genes (Table S3).

    > We obtained the full set of human protein-coding genes from HGNC [24] and curated potential gene synonyms from various sources including ENTREZ, UniProt, Ensembl, and Wikipedia. For specific gene families, we also manually added family-level synonyms which are not captured by synonyms curated at the single gene level. This included genes encoding the following proteins: T cell receptor subunits, immunoglobulin subunits, class II MHC molecules, hemoglobin subunits, surfactant proteins, chymotrypsinogen subunits, CD8 subunits (CD8A, CD8B), and CD3 subunits (CD3E, CD3G, CD3D, and CD247). The complete gene vocabulary is given in File S4.
    > For the cell type annotation algorithm described subsequently, we only considered protein-coding genes which were strongly associated with at least one cell type in the literature (local score ≥ 3; see description of local scores below). Further, we excluded mitochondrially encoded genes (gene names starting with "MT-"), genes encoding ribosomal proteins (gene names starting with "RPS", "RPL", "MRPS", or "MRPL"), and MHC class I genes except for HLA-G (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-E, HLA-F). These filtering steps yielded a final set of 5113 "eligible genes" for consideration during the cell type annotation steps (indicated in File S4).

    > To get comprehensive gene function of rambai genes, gene annotation to seven databases, namely National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein sequences (NR), NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome Ortholog (KO), SwissProt, Protein family (Pfam), Gene Ontology (GO) and Cluster of Orthologous Groups (KOG), was used as reference.
    > The NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), include protein sequence information from GenBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), SwissProt, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and Protein Research Foundation (PRF). The NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) are the nucleotide sequence database that includes nucleotide sequence from GenBank of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as cell, organism and ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. KEGG is an established Cluster of Orthologous (KO) annotation system that can accomplish the function annotation of the genome/transcriptome of a newly sequenced species. SwissProt is a manual annotated and reviewed protein sequence database that has a high-quality protein sequence database from experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions. Pfam is comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile of hidden Markov models. Many proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of a specific structural domain possesses a certain degree of conservative property. GO is the established standard for the functional annotation of gene products and controlled vocabulary used to classify the functional attributes of gene products of a biological process, a molecular function and a cellular component.

- Summary: FlyBase (flybase.org), the MOD for Drosophila melanogaster, has established a ‘Gene Group’ resource: high-quality sets of genes derived from the published literature and organized into individual report pages, to enable researchers with diverse backgrounds and interests to easily view and analyse acknowledged D. melanogsaster gene sets and compare them with those of other species.

    > Given the wealth of post-genomic data, it should be straightforward to query a biological database and obtain a robust list of genes related by the shared attributes of their products, such as actins, protein kinases or subunits of the proteasome. However, this is often not the case. For evolutionary-related genes, BLAST (1) or domain-based searches may yield a good preliminary list, but without further analysis, particularly when inferring function from se-quence, it is hard to distinguish false positives. Additionally, there may be false negatives because a gene may be somewhat atypical or fails to score above a given threshold. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations can be used to search for gene products that are related by common biological attributes, but annotation is not exhaustive and expressing features that pertain to sequence does not fall within its scope (2,3).
    > An alternative approach to finding related genes (at least in species with well-characterized genomes such as humans and model organisms) can be to search for gene symbols that share a common prefix. This can be effective for databases such as WormBase (4) or the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) (5) that assign unifying and systematic gene symbols to nematode and human genes, respectively, based on shared structures, functions or phenotypes. However, this strategy is not generally applicable to Drosophila melanogaster genes in FlyBase (6) as these are traditionally named on a gene-by-gene basis by the authors who first publish on the gene, often reflecting a specific mutant phenotype.
    > A third method for acquiring a set of related genes is to directly consult relevant research or review articles. The advantage of this approach is that the list is compiled directly from an expert and peer-reviewed source, and as such will be robust and clearly attributable. However, it can be time-consuming to seek out and then extract a set of genes from individual publications (or, often, their supplementary data) and lists obtained in this manner are inherently uncoupled from the relevant species database, meaning that the listed gene symbols/IDs may become stale over time.
    > Several databases have addressed these issues by providing explicit sets of related genes.

All the data deposited in eFG can be freely downloaded for academic use. Furthermore, eFG provides access to gene expression data measured under different conditions deposited in GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) (14) and PLEXdb (15) databases for further analysis.
    > In addition, a user-friendly interactive interface was constructed for querying genes of interest. By submitting gene symbols (e.g. FGSG_00296), one can retrieve annotations of interest, homologs in other databases, and orthologs in other species, among others, for this gene by selecting distinct drop-down options (Figure 2). Furthermore, one can also retrieve corresponding genes' information by identifiers of enzymatic function [e.g. query with 'EC:1.3.5.1' can return genes with the catalytic function of 'succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone)'], protein domains (e.g. query with 'IPR001926' can retrieve the genes which contain the domain of 'Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme, beta subunit'), KEGG pathway (e.g. query with 'fgr00260' can present all genes which are included in the 'glycine, serine and threonine metabolism' pathway) and annotation key word (e.g. 'kinase' and 'transferase' can respectively return the genes that are annotated with the key words). In addition, logical combination by word 'AND' (e.g. key words 'kinase and serine' can list the genes which are kinases and contain serine) is also supported.

    > gene_input Mandatory fields are 'gene_name', 'uniprot', 'hgnc_symbol' and 'ensembl'. This file is critical for establishing the link between the scRNA-seq data and the interaction pairs stored at the protein level. It includes the following gene and protein identifiers: (i) gene name ('gene_name'), (ii) UniProt identifier ('uniprot'), (iii) HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbol ('hgnc_symbol') and (iv) gene Ensembl identifier (ENSG) ('ensembl'). To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > Labelling of such a gene as "inactivated" seems biologically correct. This is translated to the CDS qualifier /pseudo in EMBL and securely ensures that the protein translation is not present in UniProt (e.g., searching for OE_1059R results in no hit). When, however, an invalid partial translation product is produced but not tagged as disrupted (as is the case for VNG0034H), then this is considered by EMBL as a "regular" gene (CDS). Such a gene fragment is included as a regular protein in UniProt (VNG0034H is Q9HSX6). Upon superficial analysis, this may be taken as evidence for an "improved" (because less incomplete) genome annotation in strain NRC-1 compared to strain R1. In addition, according to EMBL requirements, the "CDS" coordinates of OE_1059R must be given as 29913-31570, thus covering and including the integrated transposon ISH1 (with its transposase gene). Only a "tolerated" misc_feature annotation allows representation of this disrupted gene in a biologically meaningful way, representing the reconstructed ancestral gene.

    > determine their activity, new protein interactions, quantitative parameters such as copy number and kinetics constants, and possible functional roles that are completely unknown today. While we manually checked characterization assignments, some genes may be miscategorized or their characterization level may be misleading. There are several reasons for this. First, we did not use some GO terms, specifically GO:0005515-protein binding, GO:0042802-identical protein binding and GO:0042803-protein homodimerization activity, even if supported by experimental evidence, because these GO terms are insufficient for consideration in the algorithm due to their ambiguous contribution to the functioning of the gene product. One example is the putative fim-brial protein YbgD which was initially categorized as Uncharacterized because it only had an identical protein binding GO term imported; we corrected this by adding more specific GO terms for both molecular function and biological process in which it was involved and will curate with more specific GO terms for other genes when mischaracterizations are found. Second, the algorithm automatically classifies the subunits of Well-characterized complexes as also being Well-characterized even if the function of the subunit is uncertain. These are manually changed when found, such as the cydX and appX encoded 'accessory' subunits of uncertain function within the Well-characterized cytochrome bd-I and cytochrome bd-II ubiquinol:oxygen oxidoreductase complexes, which were changed from Well-characterized to Partial, are cases in point.

    > For human genes, we recommend using the Entrez Gene database IDs (e.g. 4193 corresponds to MDM2, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4193) or gene symbols (MDM2 is the official symbol recommended by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee). As gene symbols change over time, we recommend maintaining both gene symbols and Entrez Gene IDs.

    > • Pathway enrichment analysis of short non-coding genomic regions such as transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-seq experiments need additional consideration.

    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.
