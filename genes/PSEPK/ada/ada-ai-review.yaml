description: >-
  Bifunctional Ada protein that combines O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity
  with transcriptional activation function. The C-terminal domain performs suicidal
  methyl transfer from O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine to a catalytic cysteine
  (Cys319), while the N-terminal domain repairs methylphosphotriesters via a zinc-coordinating
  cysteine cluster (Cys36, Cys40, Cys67, Cys70). Upon methylation of the N-terminal domain,
  Ada becomes a transcriptional activator that induces expression of the alkA-ada operon
  in response to alkylating agents such as MMS and MNNG. In P. putida KT2440, Ada activates
  the alkA promoter (~60-fold induction by MMS) through binding to conserved Ada box motifs,
  but notably does not regulate alkB, which is constitutively expressed in this organism
  unlike in E. coli.

    summary: >-
      Ada is a DNA-binding protein that interacts with DNA in two functional contexts:
      (1) as a DNA repair enzyme that binds to alkylated DNA substrates to perform
      direct reversal repair, and (2) as a transcription factor that binds to Ada box
      motifs (A and B boxes) in the promoter region of target genes. The deep research
      confirms Ada's DNA-binding activity and notes the protein contains "N-terminal
      regulatory/Ada-like domain (HTH/AraC features, inferred Zn-binding) and C-terminal
      O6-alkylguanine transferase domain" [ada-deep-research-falcon.md]. The
      UniProt record indicates a HTH araC/xylS-type domain (positions 80-181).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      DNA binding is a core function of Ada, required for both its enzymatic DNA repair
      activity and its transcriptional regulatory function. This general term is appropriate
      as a parent term given the more specific annotations for sequence-specific binding.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Ada functions as a methylation-dependent transcriptional activator. Upon methylation
      of the N-terminal cysteine (Cys36 in P. putida), Ada gains enhanced DNA binding
      affinity and switches into a transcription factor that activates expression of
      the alkA-ada operon. The deep research states: "The N-terminal domain repairs
      methylphosphotriesters (MPTs) and, when methylated, activates transcription of
      target promoters" and notes "alkA transcript induction by MMS was reported at ~60-fold"
      with "ada deletion eliminated induction" [ada-deep-research-falcon.md].

      Transcriptional activation is a core function of Ada. The protein contains a

      bifunctional property of Ada proteins across bacteria.

      This annotation requires careful evaluation. Ada is involved in a methylation
      process, but it is the RECIPIENT of methylation (self-methylation during DNA
      repair), not a methylator of other substrates. The enzyme accepts methyl groups
      from alkylated DNA and transfers them to its own cysteine residues. This is a
      suicidal (single-turnover) reaction that inactivates the protein. The term
      GO:0032259 "methylation" typically refers to adding methyl groups TO substrates,
      not removing them FROM substrates. Ada performs DNA DEalkylation/DEmethylation,
      not methylation of substrates. The deep research confirms: "irreversible (suicidal)
