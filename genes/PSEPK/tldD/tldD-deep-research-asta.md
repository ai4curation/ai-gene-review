## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88PB0
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Protease involved in Microcin B17 maturation and in sensitivity to the DNA gyrase inhibitor LetD {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66565.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=tldD {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66565.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_0940 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66565.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the peptidase U62 family.
- **Key Domains:** Metalloprtase-TldD/E_C. (IPR045569); Metalloprtase-TldD/E_cen_dom. (IPR045570); Metalloprtase-TldD/E_N. (IPR002510); Peptidase_U62_metallo. (IPR051463); TldD. (IPR025502)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "tldD" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'tldD' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **tldD** (gene ID: tldD, UniProt: Q88PB0) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > We chose cell migration genes and proteases/inhibitors as candidate virulence factors, due to their relevance in hostpathogen interactions (e.g., Barragan and Sibley 2002;McKerrow et al. 2006;Bouzid et al. 2013). Given the low amount of functional (GO) annotation in our largest assembly, C. shasta þ NHP (see Results), we used BlastX to search for homologs of genes of interest in two custom concatenated databases that comprised the Cell Migration Knowledge Database (CMKB) which includes proteins, families, and complexes involved in cell migration (http://www.cellmigration. org/index.shtml, last accessed February 5, 2015; $7,600 protein sequences), and the MEROPS database, which consists of a nr library of full-length sequences of peptidases and peptidase inhibitors (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/, last accessed December 2, 2014; $450,000 sequences; Rawlings et al. 2016). We searched using the longest representatives for each gene in the C. shasta þ NHP assembly (23,418 contigs; IIR-RBT6) then parsed matches (bit score > 100) and posteriorly classified homologs to proteases or motility genes matching the specific databases. We then selected only genes with the same annotation in UniProt (determined using the same standards: no ambiguous terms filtering, bit score > 100) to confirm gene identity. Due to disagreements between annotations (CMKB vs. UniProt, and MEROPS vs. UniProt), we curated gene lists manually, removing genes that matched one or more of the following criteria: 1) no genetic distances available (only available for reference); 2) disagreements between annotations from the different databases, after checking for synonyms or function similarity; 3) annotations that contained terms from UniProt "Uncharacterized protein" and "Predicted protein" (ambiguous terms), and whose identity could not be confirmed; and 4) annotations that contained nonspecific terms, such as "heat shock protein" or "ribosomal protein."

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):

    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > The lists of proteins used for the comparison contain more items than listed previously due to expansion out of gene clusters, for example, to allow the updating and comparison of current HGNC gene symbols. These lists of proteins were compared in Microsoft Excel 2011 using PivotTable.
    > The protein set for the CHO midbody was derived from the accession numbers in Table S1 and Table S2 from Skop et al. [9]. Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.
    > The protein set for the HeLa spindle proteome is derived from the 1121 accession numbers in Sauer et al. supplementary table 1 column 2 [17]. Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > The scientific community has recently witnessed the publication of several large eukaryotic genomes in various stages of completion, including the human genome [1,2], the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [3], the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster [4], and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana [5,6]. Each of these genomes contains over 10,000 genes, and as scientists attempt to study these genes more closely, the need for accurate gene models becomes increasingly apparent. For high-throughput genome sequencing projects, equally rapid high-throughput genome annotation is necessary, and bioinformaticists use a variety of computational methods to generate this annotation. Despite many improvements in recent years, these computational methods still fall short of producing correct models for every gene. In order to improve the annotation and facilitate further research, it is essential that we develop methods to identify genes correctly.
    > Annotation of a gene model should include a precise description of where the genomic DNA sequence is transcribed into messenger RNA, the positions in the mRNA of any and all introns, and the translated protein sequence of the gene. If alternative splice variants are present, these should be annotated as well. Computational methods for genome annotation have several shortcomings that result in the following errors in annotation.
    > Gene prediction programs predict exon boundaries correctly only about 80% of the time, even for the most intensively studied organisms [7][8][9]. Thus a gene with five exons will be completely correct only 0.8 5 = 33% of the time, and genes with more exons will be even less likely to be correct. Gene prediction programs also tend to merge and split gene models. Thus two real genes may be merged into one predicted transcript, or vice versa. In addition, programs to align genomic DNA to protein sequences often miss small exons, especially when the homologous proteins are not well conserved. Annotation protocols also tend to miss short genes.

    > Protein-coding gene annotation is typically a two-step process. Initially, Prodigal is employed to identify open reading frames (ORFs) by locating gene coordinates, but it does not infer gene function. To assign putative functions, Prokka performs hierarchical annotation by comparing candidate genes to curated protein databases. It begins with a user-supplied, high-confidence protein set, using BLAST+ for sequence similarity searches. If no match is found, it progresses to UniProt's verified bacterial proteins, covering \~ 16,000 sequences, and then optionally to RefSeq proteins specific to the organism's genuscapturing nomenclature consistency. When sequence-based annotation fails, Prokka applies profile-based searches using HMMER's hmmscan to query against Pfam and TIGRFAMs databases. An e-value threshold of 10 −6 is consistently applied to ensure significance. If no reliable match is found across all levels, the gene is designated as a "hypothetical protein. " This layered strategy maximizes annotation accuracy and functional insight across diverse bacterial genomes (Seemann, 2014).
    > The genome of coliphage ASEC2201 has been analyzed and three holin protein coding genes were selected. The sequences of all three holin proteins were retrieved from NCBI using accession no. SRX17770782 in the FASTA format. The sequence similarity search was performed via BLAST against the non-redundant database (Altschul et al., 1990).

    > The E. coli K-12 Reference Proteome and Data Sources-Two databases Uniprot (29) and EcoLOCATION (32) and the proposed IM proteome (33) were the main initial starting points for the complete subcellular categorization of K-12 described here. The E. coli K-12/ MG1655 strain is one of the microbial proteomes whose comprehensive annotation is of the highest priority in Uniprot (29). This is the "reference proteome" for E. coli, contains 4303 proteins, and has been annotated here. Our annotation has been formulated in such a way that it can be easily incorporated in Uniprot.
    > EchoLOCATION has an easily accessible table that maps gene names to subcellular locations. However, mapping the gene names given by EchoLOCATION to the respective protein identifiers in Uniprot was not straightforward. Unfortunately, gene names cannot serve as unique identifiers of a protein sequence. In more than 100 cases the gene name of a predicted protein in EchoLOCATION when searched against Uniprot gave as a result more than one K-12 protein hits. That is because there are proteins that have common synonymous gene names with the primary gene name of others.
    > To retrieve updated Uniprot accession identifiers and to map Uniprot accessions identifiers to EchoLOCATION identifiers (termed: EchoBASE IDs) we used the "ID mapping" function of Uniprot. In cases where the only provided identifiers were the gene names, we used mySQL queries to compare with the primary and alternative gene names in Uniprot. In cases where multiple matches existed for the same gene name, we manually resolved the differences based on other information (e.g. protein description, mass etc.).
    > The annotation of pseudogenes, mobile elements, transposons, and insertion elements relied on EcoGene (34), Uniprot (29), and Ochman et al. (35). The list of E. coli K-12 complexes was retrieved from EcoCyc (31) and literature searches.

The potential tendon-healing targets of the active components of SHT matched the potential gene targets of the active ingredients of SHT. According to the UniProt database (https://www.uniprot.org/), the full names of the target proteins were transformed into gene symbols based on the UniProt ID (The UniProt Consortium, 2017) (Figure 1). The database leverages the unique rich combinatorial annotations of GeneCards. The GeneCards database provides direct links to generelated research reagents, such as antibodies, recombinant proteins, DNA clones, and inhibitory RNAs, and lists of gene-related drugs and compounds. GeneCards was used to depict the GeneCards Inferred Functionality Score annotation landscape tool for scoring the functional status of genes (Fishilevich et al., 2016).

    > There are several knowledge bases that represent the collected knowledge of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome: EcoCyc (11), EcoGene (12), UniProt (13) and RefSeq (14). Other useful knowledge bases cater to specific classes of gene products, such as the RegulonDB, which contains manually curated functional information about transcription factors in E. coli (15). Our initial review of these knowledge bases yielded conflicting information on gene function and level of annotation for many E. coli genes. Any attempt to systematically assess the function of unannotated genes must therefore draw from multiple knowledge bases and resolve these conflicts.
    > Many research groups have categorized E. coli genes and proteins by annotation quality as a part of their studies. In 2009, Hu et (16). First, they identified all unannotated proteins in the K-12 W3110 and MG1655 genomes. In order for a protein-encoding gene to be considered functionally uncharacterized in their analysis, it had to meet the following criteria: (i) The gene name begins with 'y', (ii) the gene does not have a known pathway within EcoCyc and (iii) the gene does not have a functional description in Gen-ProtEC (17) (any gene with a description containing the words 'predicted', 'hypothetical', or 'conserved'). Based on these criteria, it was determined that 1431 of 4225 protein coding sequences were not functionally annotated. In 2015, Kim et al. published a database called EcoliNet that curated and predicted cofunctional gene networks for every protein coding gene in the E. coli genome (18). This study also quantified the number of uncharacterized protein coding genes in E. coli. To assess functional annotation, they used the presence of experimentally supported 'biological process' annotations in the Gene Ontology database (19). They concluded that ∼2000 protein coding genes in E. coli were not functionally annotated. The most comprehensive effort to assess the level of annotation in bacterial genomes has been Computational Bridges to Experiments (COM-BREX) (20,21).

The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > After a genome is assembled, the next step is genomic annotation, which can generate data that will allow various types of research of the model organism. Complete DNA sequences of the organism are then mapped in areas pertinent to the research objectives. In this chapter, we explore relevant ongoing research on genes and consider the gene as a basic mapping unit. Gene prediction is the first hurdle we come across to begin the extensive and intensive work demonstrated in first item, which deals with assembly of the genome. Gene prediction can be made with computational techniques for recognizing gene sequences, including stop codons and the initial portions of nucleotide sequences; it involves empirical rules concerning minimum coding sequences (CDS's) and is limited due to overlapping sequences coding forward and reverse. Finishing gene prediction step by a computer initiates the functional annotation stage. Functional annotation, item 3, can be done initially by computer, using similarity in sequence alignment. However, no software is capable of generating a functional annotation without many false positive results, since conserved protein domains with varied functions make gene sequence alignment difficult. In this case, after automatic annotation, the predicted genes need to be revised manually. In manual curation, item 4, an expert can more accurately locate frameshifts in the DNA strand. Depending on the number of errors found, genomic annotation may be postponed, requiring a return to the previous stage of genome assembly. In manual curation, the principal contributions are usually correction of the start codon position, gene name, gene product and, finally, identification of frameshifts. When functional annotation is completed, the genome should subsequently be submitted. It occurs after the assembly and annotation steps making the data generated available in public-access databanks. Submission is a pre-requisite for publication in scientific journals. Another advantage of genome publication in public-access sites is that it permits use of various genome analysis tools. For example, searches for genomic plasticity, pangenomic study, exported antigens and evaluation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The pangenome approach, item 5, concepts of species can be used as a filter for targeting candidates for vaccines, diagnostic kits and drug development. For drug development, the

    > The content of the result table can be defined by preselecting individual types of information that are grouped and presented by LEGER as part of four main topics, termed Annotation, Subcellular Localization, Protein Information and Comparative Genomics. The topic 'Annotation' refers to information for the functional assignment of genes or proteins. Whereas 'Description' and 'Classification' represent the original annotation, the UniProt-Swiss-Prot entries give access to the data of curated databases to reveal inconsistencies accumulated in the past 105 years. However, further powerful databases and services have to be considered for the generation of functional hypotheses and thus are included as part of this topic (e.g. Gene Ontology Annotation from UniProt and InterPro). With 'SPS-Annotation', the user receives information whether the selected genes/proteins were mentioned within a systematic post-genome study. This part requires manual updating and currently refers to the most important and comprehensive studies such as the investigation of PrfA-dependent gene expression (11), stress regulation and adaptation (12,13) and proteome studies aiming at subcellular reference maps derived from 2D-PAGE analyses (15,21). 'MineBlast' was recently published and can retrieve the most recent functional Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, Database issue D403 information for listerial proteins and their orthologues from other organisms in literature (22). MineBlast often can complement missing functional assignments with data that were published following the first annotation of a genome and thus alleviates a still highly manual task. A genome-wide MineBlast query was already completed and adapted result pages shortcut the alternative processing using the public NCBI services (BLAST and PubMed queries). 'Genome View' and 'KEGG' generate links to graphical presentations for every gene/protein in the result table. Adapted KEGG pathway pages display the distribution of proteins along biochemical pathways (Figure 2). The Genome Viewer displays the experimental results at the level of genome organization. Genes are visualized according to their length, order and orientation in the genome (Figure 1). Rho-independent terminator sites and operon predictions help to recognize putative transcriptional units.
