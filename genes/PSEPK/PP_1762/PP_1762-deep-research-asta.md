## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88M13
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=TenA family transcriptional regulator {ECO:0008006|Google:ProtNLM};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_1762 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN67382.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Haem_Oase-like_multi-hlx. (IPR016084); Haem_oxygenas_2 (PF14518)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_1762" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_1762' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_1762** (gene ID: PP_1762, UniProt: Q88M13) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > The protein sequences were functionally annotated by combining information retrieved from the UniProt database ( [25], accessed on 9 June 2022) and one-to-one fast orthology assignments using the eggNOG-mapper v.2.1.7 tool ( [26], accessed on 9 June 2022), as described in [27]. Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

- Citations: 5
- Summary: The Plant Parasitic Nematodes Database (PPND) is developed, a platform to combine genomic, transcriptomic, protein, and functional annotation data, allowing users to conduct BLAST searches and genome browser analyses and download bioinformatics data for in-depth research.

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.764)
    > PPND integrates various sequences, annotations, and expression information to provide an efficient search tool for researchers, including the gene, gene family, transcription factor (TF), and protein kinase searches. In subsequent work, we added four additional tool modules: flanking sequence finder, TTL (Transthyretin-like) family [46] finder, pathway map, and miRNA search. Users can enter the gene ID obtained from BLAST or the genome browser into the gene search function to obtain more information. This includes information on the origin of the organism, gene family, KEGG ID, coding sequence, protein sequence, annotation information (site position and annotation source database), and expression data (Figure 4). This information will allow researchers to gain a basic understanding of the gene structure and function. Certain search functionalities, such as the protein kinase search, complement the gene search function. They provide more detailed assistance for researchers with varying levels of bioinformatics analysis expertise. Therefore, PPND provides Pfam links in the gene search function. By linking to InterPro, researchers can access additional information. Using this toolkit, users can also obtain information on the upstream and downstream sequences, functional components, signaling pathways, and miRNA sequences of the target gene. These data can help researchers conduct more in-depth investigations.
    > Gene families are groups of genes derived from a single ancestral gene due to gene duplication events. They usually have high similarity in structure and function and encode similar proteins with shared domains. For example, the MADS-box gene family [47] is involved in plant growth and development, especially flower reproductive development. In PPND, users can search for a gene family by entering the gene family name or Pfam ID and selecting a species. They can also click "↓" to make a selection. The "↓" button will display a random set of 50 members, including the family name and Pfam ID. The platform provides a list of genes from that family along with the option to obtain their sequences in FASTA format (Figure 5). Gene families are groups of genes derived from a single ancestral gene due to gene duplication events. They usually have high similarity in structure and function and encode similar proteins with shared domains.

    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > The user can also choose between the two Gene pages via the register tabs specifying the strains (see Fig. 3). The next section of the Gene page contains detailed information about the gene (Gene section, Fig. 2A). This section covers the basic information from the Summary section as well as the gene coordinates, gene length, essentiality, DNA sequence, and accession numbers used by external databases with corresponding links, including BioCyc (40) and PneumoBrowse 2 (23). The largest section, the Protein section (Fig. 2B), is dedicated to the encoded protein. Here, users can find the protein length, molecular weight, isoelectric point, catalyzed reaction, protein function assignments based on TIGRFAMs, Pfam, and the SEED (see Materials and Methods), subcellular localization, and other information. If the selected gene encodes a transcriptional regulator, the corresponding regulon members are displayed, as shown in Fig. 2B. As for the Gene section, the Protein section is concluded with database links (NCBI and UniProt) and the protein sequence. Functional annotations based on complementary classification algorithms (TIGRFAMs, Pfam, and the SEED) can support the elucidation of protein functions in the case of proteins with poorly characterized or unknown function. For the sake of conciseness, by default, the lists of assigned predicted functions according to TIGRFAMs and Pfam are collapsed and show only the hit with the best HMM-score but can be expanded by clicking on the plus sign.
    > The following section of the Gene page (Expression and regulation, Fig. 2C) provides information related to regulation and gene expression. This includes the predicted operon structure obtained from MicrobesOnline (41), regulation by transcription factors (Table 1), and a link to the respective gene expression data in PneumoExpress (15). For the TIGR4 strain, additional data on transcription start sites and operon structures determined experimentally by Warrier et al. (42) are provided.

    > To assign functional or gene categories, we integrated cancer genes, tumor suppressors, epigenetic regulators, DNA damage repair genes, human essential genes, kinases and transcription factors. In each gene group, we checked the retention and ORFs of the main protein functional features. There are 13 features belonging to the 'region' category, including 'calcium binding', 'coiled coil', 'compositional bias', 'DNA binding', 'domain', 'intramembrane', 'motif', 'nucleotide binding', 'region', 'repeat', 'topological domain', 'transmembrane' and 'zinc finger'. To perform the protein functional feature retention search, we first downloaded the GFF (General Feature Format) format protein information of 10 651 UniProt accessions from UniProt for 10 619 genes involved in 15 030 fusion genes ( 10 ). UniProt provides the loci information of 39 protein features, including six molecule processing features, 13 region features, four site features, six amino acid modification features, two natural variation features, five experimental info features and three secondary structure features. Since such feature loci information is based on amino acid sequences, the genomic breakpoint information was converted into the amino acid level while considering all UniProt protein accessions, ENST isoforms and multiple breakpoints for each partner. To map each feature to the human genome sequence, we used the GENCODE (v19) gene model of human reference genome ( 11 ). For the 5 -partner gene, we considered the protein feature to be retained in the fusion gene if the breakpoints occurred on the 3 -end of the protein feature. On the contrary, if a protein domain was not entirely included in the fusion amino acid sequence, we reported such fusion genes as having not retained that protein feature. Similarly, for the 3partner gene, we considered the fusion gene to have retained the protein feature if the breakpoints occurred on the 5 -end of the protein feature region.

A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Given a set of predicted protein-coding genes for a newly sequenced genome, functional annotation involves assigning putative functions to the predicted genes. Two ways in which this can be done are assigning protein names and Gene Ontology (GO;Gene Ontology Consortium, 2010) terms to the predicted proteins. Here we describe a computational pipeline for assigning protein names and GO terms to predicted proteins in parasitic worm (nematode and platyhelminth) genomes, which transfers names and GO terms from orthologues in other species.
    > When assigning protein names, UniProt protein naming rules (www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot) are followed where possible. This recommends that a good and stable name for a protein is "as neutral as possible"; that a protein name "should be, as far as possible, unique and attributed to all orthologs"; and a protein name "should not contain a specific characteristic of the protein, and in particular it should not reflect the function or role of the protein, nor its subcellular location, its domain structure, its tissue specificity, its molecular weight or its species of origin".
    > In our protocol, a protein name is assigned to each predicted protein based on curated names in UniProt (Bairoch & Apweiler, 2000) for human, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schistosoma mansoni orthologues identified from a database of gene families (e.g. built using Ensembl Compara; Vilella et al. 2009), or (if no information is found from orthologues) based on InterPro (Hunter et al. 2012) domains. Figure 1 shows an example of using our protein naming pipeline for four Strongyloides ratti genes that belong to the tubulin polyglutamylase family (underlined in pink), where four different protein names were assigned to them (in pink), based on names of their C. elegans or human orthologues.
    > Since each of the S. ratti genes belonged to a different subfamily of the tubulin polyglutamylase family, they were assigned different names.

The newly released DEG 10 has been developed to accommodate the quantitative and qualitative advancements brought by the progressive identification methods. Currently available records of both essential and nonessential genes among a wide range of organisms can be downloaded from DEG 10, making it possible to compare the two different types of genes in many aspects 21 .
    > 27 prokaryotic organisms including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and Methanococcus maripaludis S2, the only record of the Archaea domain were selected to analyze the protein localization and GO distribution of the essential and nonessential genes. There are 31 bacterial records corresponding to 27 organisms in the database in total and 26 sets of data were selected in the current study. Streptococcus pneumonia was not chosen for the lack of non-essential genes. Since the essential genes were not genome-widely identified, it's not reasonable to regard the complementary set of essential genes as non-essential genes in Streptococcus pneumonia 29,30 . In the case of multiple records for one organism, the one with the most convincing experimental methods was chosen. The non-essential genes in Methanococcus maripaludis S2 and 13 bacteria such as Escherichia coli MG1655 are obtained based on the original literatures, while non-essential genes in other 12 organisms such as Bacillus subtilis 168 are the complementary set of essential genes. The information of the organisms used in the current study are displayed in Table 1.
    > The three model genomes' subcellular location information and the Gene Ontology (GO) terms used for the analysis in the current study were downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt; http://www.uniprot.org). Maintained by the UniProt Consortium, UniProt is committed to providing biologists with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and functional annotation 27 . Among the wealth of annotation data, detailed GO annotation statements are included.

Overview of KinaseFusionDB and its role in understanding kinase fusion proteins. (a) I. The top section identifies therapeutic targets for oncogenic activation of kinases, including wild-type kinases activated by overexpression or genomic amplification, mutated kinases with gain-offunction mutations, and kinase fusion proteins resulting from chromosomal rearrangements. II. The middle section highlights the functionalities of KinaseFusionDB, such as providing functional annotations, mRNA/protein expression data, drug binding information, and relevant literature reviews. III. The third section addresses the current limitations in targeting kinase fusion proteins, particularly the lack of comprehensive 3D structures for these proteins. It emphasizes the partial knowledge of kinase fusion protein structures and the need for further drug screening. IV. The bottom section discusses how computational approaches, such as predicted 3D structures (e.g. from AlphaFold2), can fill these gaps, supporting drug screening and filtering based on consistent binding among multiple fusion protein isoforms.

    > HymenopteraMine provides a report for each entity in the database. Each report is divided into sections including 'Summary', 'Gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Protein', 'Function', 'Homology', 'Others' or a subset of those categories, depending on the identifier searched. For example, searching a protein identifier would provide sections relevant to proteins. Each section of the report provides information in the form of a table that can be customized and downloaded in various formats. The Summary section of a Gene Report provides gene identifiers, symbols, description, organism, chromosome, strand and other identifiers such as aliases (identifiers from previous OGS versions) and database cross references. The Transcripts section provides information about the gene model (transcripts, exons, coding sequences) and gives a visual representation of the gene model highlighting the structure of the gene. Users can download FASTA-formatted sequences for each type of feature provided in the gene model section. Links are provided to JBrowse and to NCBI gene pages, when applicable. Transcript identifiers are linked to Transcript Reports, which include a Gene Expression section that provides raw read counts, normalized read counts, FPKM and RPKM values for RNAseq data with SRA metadata. The Protein section of the Gene Report includes protein name, accession and length. The protein name/accession numbers are linked to Protein Reports, with more information including protein family, GO annotations, InterPro domains, related publications, protein features, and curated notes from UniProt describing tissue specificity, function and developmental stages. The Function section provides GO annotation with evidence codes from the Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component ontologies. Clicking on the symbols to the right of each GO term leads to the directed acyclic graph showing all parents and children of the term, developed using the BioJS DAG Viewer (50). Clicking on a GO term provides a report for that term, a list of genes annotated with that term and tables showing relationships to other GO terms. The Homologue sec-tion lists homologues in other hymenopteran species and Drosophila melanogaster. The 'Other' section provides publications and a list of overlapping features.

    > Datasets can be inserted or uploaded to the web interface (Figure 2b). Data must be tab separated and formatted as shown in Figure 3A. They could include gene symbols and UniProt identifiers, which are used for the Gene Ontology annotation feature. To annotate a dataset which contains gene symbols and/ or UniProt identifiers, the appropriate organism can be set (Figure 2d) and the user can choose between full or slim GO annotation (Figure 2e) and full or experimental evidence (Figure 2f). The annotation is based on the gene and UniProt identifiers provided by UniProt-GOA and will be updated monthly.
    > It is essential that the first column contains the experimental value (log fold-change, isotope incorporation, intensity, etc.). Titles of the annotation columns are used to discriminate between different types of annotation in the results. If a pasted dataset already contains annotations such as KEGG and Pfam, these terms must reside in tab separated and titled columns (Figure 3A and online help). Annotations need to be located in the last columns. Importantly, semi-colons must separate multiple identifiers or terms in one column. For example, multiple identifiers are common for protein groups of mass spectrometric data and annotation will be done for all entries. Similarly, multiple terms are also common with Gene Ontology as one gene can be associated with several compartments at the same time and any of these terms will be treated independently. When columns of annotation are provided, the correct number of columns must be set in the respective spin-box in the web interface (Figure 2c). The dataset used in the example analysis already contains three annotation columns (KEGG, Pfam and InterPro) and is available on the web site of the tool as tab separated text file and Excel file (Figure 2a).
    > Regulation or the enrichment based on various statistics (estimators) can be tested depending on the focus of the analysis (Figure 2g). The number of resamplings R can be set in the range from 500 to 10,000 (Figure 2h).

    > The ultimate goal of the functional annotation process (Figure 4) is to assign biologically relevant information to predicted polypeptides, and to the features they derive from (e.g. gene, mRNA). This process is especially relevant nowadays in the context of the NGS era due to the capacity of sequencing, assembling, and annotating full genomes in short periods of time, e.g. less than a month. Functional elements could range from putative name and/or symbols for protein-coding genes, e.g. ADH to its putative biological function, e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase, associated gene ontology terms, e.g. GO:0004022, functional sites, e.g. METAL 47 47 Zinc 1, and domains, e.g. IPR002328, among other features. The function of predicted proteins can be computationally inferred based on the similarity between the sequence of interest and other sequences in different public repositories, e.g. BLASTP against Uniprot. Caution should be taken when assigning results merely based on sequence similarity as two evolutionary independent sequences which share some common domains could be considered homologs 62 . Thus, whenever possible, it is better to use orthologous sequences for annotation purposes rather than simply similar sequences 63 . With the growing number of sequences in those public repositories, it is possible to perform various searches and combine obtained results into a consensus annotation. The accurate assignment of the functional elements is a complex process, and the best annotation will involve manual curation.
    > There are two main outcomes of the functional annotation process. The first is the assignment of functional elements to genes. Downstream analysis of these elements allow further understanding of specific genome properties, e.g. metabolic pathways, and similarities compared with closely related species. The second result of the functional annotation is the additional quality check for the predicted gene set. It is possible to identify problematic and/or suspicious genes by the presence of specific domains, suspicious orthology assignment and/or absence of other functional elements, e.g. functional completeness.
