## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88HL2
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Nickel ABC transporter permease subunit {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68948.1}; EC=3.6.3.24 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68948.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=nikC {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68948.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_3344 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68948.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport system
- **Key Domains:** ABC_transport_permease. (IPR053385); BP-dependent_transpt_permease. (IPR050366); MetI-like. (IPR000515); MetI-like_sf. (IPR035906); Nickel_NikC. (IPR014157)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "nikC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'nikC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **nikC** (gene ID: nikC, UniProt: Q88HL2) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

(3) Proteins were considered to have "vague" annotations if the gene description contained "family", "domain protein", "related protein", "transporter related", or if the entire description matched common non-specific annotations ("abc transporter atp-binding protein", "abc transporter permease", "abc transporter substrate-binding protein", "abc transporter", "acetyltransferase", "alpha/beta hydrolase", "aminohydrolase", "aminotransferase", "atpase", "dehydrogenase", "dna-binding protein", "fad-dependent oxidoreductase", "gcn5-related n-acetyltransferase", "histidine kinase", "hydrolase" "lipoprotein", "membrane protein", "methyltransferase", "mfs transporter", "oxidoreductase", "permease", "porin", "predicted dna-binding transcriptional regulator", "predicted membrane protein", "probable transmembrane protein", "putative membrane protein", "response regulator receiver protein", "rnd transporter", "sam-dependent methyltransferase", "sensor histidine kinase", "serine/threonine protein kinase", "signal peptide protein", "signal transduction histidine kinase", "tonb-dependent receptor", "transcriptional regulator", "transcriptional regulators", or "transporter"). The remaining proteins were considered to have "other detailed" annotations. To identify a subset of the proteins annotated as "hypothetical" or "vague" that do not belong to any characterized families, we relied on Pfam and TIGRFAM.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > The addition of these targets to the study efflux pump associated proteins resulted in a total of 108 candidate binding proteins (BP's) targeted for the protein production and ligand screening protocols.
    > Interestingly, of the 108 candidate BP's, 21 were not clustered with an integral membrane and ATPase subunits (Additional file 1 and TransportDB) based on either proximity in genome and/or functional annotation (predicted substrate) from sequence homology. There were 72 total gene clusters having at least one representative of each ABC transporter component; of these, 9 transporters were associated with 2 SBP's, 1 was associated with 3 SBP's, 61 had one associated SBP. Four additional gene clusters were each indicated by associating one SBP with either an integral membrane or an ATPase subunit. One transporter (RPA2039) was predicted to have a fused integral membrane and solute binding subunits in a single polypeptide but was not included in the final list.

    > The lists of proteins used for the comparison contain more items than listed previously due to expansion out of gene clusters, for example, to allow the updating and comparison of current HGNC gene symbols. These lists of proteins were compared in Microsoft Excel 2011 using PivotTable.
    > The protein set for the CHO midbody was derived from the accession numbers in Table S1 and Table S2 from Skop et al. [9]. Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.
    > The protein set for the HeLa spindle proteome is derived from the 1121 accession numbers in Sauer et al. supplementary table 1 column 2 [17]. Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.

    > However, the peaks were in different positions within the gene in the four individual experiments performed (Fig. 6), and no specific binding site within the mRNA could be identified from the data.
    > Among the genes identified were numerous genes related to protein biosynthesis (tRNAs, tRNA-aminoacyl synthetases, tRNA-modifying enzymes, ribosomal proteins). As an example, genes for ribosomal proteins were highly represented with 18 out of the 22 genes (82%) for small ribosomal proteins, (12 after cold shock, 55%), and 31 out of 34 genes (91%) for large ribosomal subunit proteins (22 after cold shock, 65%). Other protein families represented were chaperones (e.g., dnaK, dnaJ, grpE, but not dafA, groES, groEL, clpB), cold-shock and general stress proteins (TT_RS08235, _09210; hsp22, hsp30; uspA), topoisomerase genes (gyrA, gyrB, topA), genes for transporters and their subunits (often both the gene for the substrate-bind-ing protein and for the permease, for example, branchedchain amino acid ABC transporter, TT_RS01115 and _01120), and genes related to sugar-and cell wall metabolism and cell division, as well as CRISPR-related genes. In many cases, genes for all subunits of protein complexes (e.g., genes for cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II; clpA, clpX coding for the ClpAX protease) were present.

    > In addition to the systematic experimental verification of novel annotations in three GO categories as described above, here we highlight individual predictions for which we found supporting evidence in the publicly available databases. This information was not available to the classifiers at the time when the models were constructed. The following examples are for E. coli K12, as this is by far the best-studied model prokaryote [21].
    > We predict genes hypC and hybG to have ''nickel cation binding.'' These genes had no GO terms assigned in the 07-02-2012 UniProt-GOA release (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/ P0AAM3 and http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0AAM7), and we therefore considered them unannotated. In the meantime, hypC was annotated with ''metal ion binding'' using experimental evidence: this is a parent GO term of our prediction. Moreover, when examining the literature, we found evidence that these two genes are involved in the biosynthesis of the [NiFe] cluster [22].
    > Another prediction is for gltL: we predicted it is annotated with ''ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complex.'' In line with our predictions, PortEco, a portal that includes information from 14 different E. coli data resources [23], labels the gene as ''ATPbinding component of ABC superfamily.'' Note that more general electronic GO annotations were available for this gene, e.g. ''ATP binding,'' ''ATPase activity,'' and ''ATP catabolic process'' (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0AAG3).
    > A similar prediction of a more detailed function is for ybgI, where we predict GO terms from both BP and MF ontologies. This gene is known to be a conserved metal-binding protein [24], having an electronic GO annotation ''metal ion binding''; we predict it is annotated with the BP GO term ''Mo-molybdopterin cofactor metabolic process.''

    > Sequence similarity analyses were accomplished using blastx [26] against the NCBI non-redundant database on protein level [32], the Swissprot database [33,34] and KEGG [35]. Additionally, manual gene annotation was performed using PRIAM [36], Motif Scan [37], Prosite  [38], BRENDA [39,40], UniProt/SwissProt [34], Inter-ProScan [41], and Pfam [42] databases. One example of how our manual annotation differed from that of the automated pipeline used by Brown et al. can be found in the case of CLAU_3519 (CAETHG_3609). Here the automated pipeline from the Brown et al. finished genome assigned this gene product as a hypothetical protein, however when the sequence was aligned using BLASTP as part of our manual curation all other proteins with >75 % identity were named sodium ABC transporter. Upon further inspection in Pfam, one large ABC-2 family transporter protein domain was found (E-value 6.8e-31). Similar searches of UniProt and KEGG databases agreed with Pfam, therefore we annotated this gene product as an ABC-2 family transporter. The correction of the previously short-called homopolymer reads through our sequencing efforts gave a fully annotated finished sequence of C. autoethanogenum without the erroneous frame-shift containing annotations which had occurred previously. Using these tools we were able to manually curate the entire genome to ensure that the automated annotation was correct and to insert additional information where required, as well as implementing a standardised protein product naming system as recommend by the NCBI guidelines [43] for ease of identification of genes with related functions. As a consequence of the automated and subsequent manual curation, we have found 482 instances across the genome where genes previously identified as 'hypothetical protein' have either been assigned a specific function, or have been named through identification of conserved domains based on sequence similarity.

    > Protein identifications with 2 peptides and a confident protein score (P <0.05) from the HpH fractionation and IDA-MS were used to assign subcellular localization. Using the top score given by WoLF PSORT [10] (www.genscript.com/wolf-psort.html) proteins were categorized into 8 locations. Membrane proteins were predicted using transmembrane helical Markov model (TMHMM) [11] (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Proteins in the solute carrier protein (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter families were identified according to gene and protein name. We also used website gene names (www.genenames.org/data) to characterise the subcellular location of the transporter and the type of substrate they transport.
    > For proteins annotated as 'uncharacterised' in figures and tables in the manuscript a BLAST protein homology search was carried out using the Ensembl or uniport accession code in uniprotKB (www.uniprot.org). The accession code page contains the sequence and a link to BLAST. BLASTp results against uniprotkb_Swissprot reference proteomes and an identity sequence match of >95.5% to human, bovine (cattle) or caprine (goat) proteome annotation was accepted as the protein name.

We established the following rules for generalizing genes into functional groups: Chaperone: genes that encode proteins that perform chaperone or chaperonin-like activities (Uniprot Keyword: KW-0143); Envelope: Genes that encode proteins involved in the maintenance of the cell-envelope such as phospholipid biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0008654) and peptidoglycan biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0000270); Metabolism: Genes that encode proteins involved in general metabolic functions, such as purine metabolism (KEGG: eco00230), amino acid metabolism (KEGG: eco00470, eco00330); or TCA Cycle (KEGG: eco00020); Regulators: Genes that encode proteins directly involved in transcription (GO-BP: 0031564; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0804), translation (GO-BP:0006412, GO-BP:0006413; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0689), or the regulation of transcription (GO-BP: 0006355, GO-BP:2000143, GO-BP:0006353, GO-BP: GO:0045893; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0805); and Transport: Genes that encode proteins involved in transport: such as ABC transporters (Interpro: PR017871), MFS transporters (Interpro: IPR011701); symporters (Interpro: IPR023954, IPR001204, IPR001734, IPR023025, IPR004840), or Antiporters (Interpro: IPR004771).

    > gene_input Mandatory fields are 'gene_name', 'uniprot', 'hgnc_symbol' and 'ensembl'. This file is critical for establishing the link between the scRNA-seq data and the interaction pairs stored at the protein level. It includes the following gene and protein identifiers: (i) gene name ('gene_name'), (ii) UniProt identifier ('uniprot'), (iii) HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbol ('hgnc_symbol') and (iv) gene Ensembl identifier (ENSG) ('ensembl'). To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > As shown in Figure 1, the comprehensive collection and mapping of transporter substrates to compound IDs from the KEGG Ligand database using the functional annotation from UniProt was achieved in four steps: (i) All UniProt entries with "transport" as a keyword were collected from the UniProt database [13][14][15]; (ii) functional annotations were extracted using the Swissknife module [16]; (iii) the annotations were grouped based on their content, allowing us to quickly and easily assess if and how the searched entries were related to transporters and providing the means to cross-check between different entries; and (iv) if the functional description from UniProt exactly matched a KEGG compound name, we assigned the KEGG compound to that description. The descriptions with mapped KEGG compounds were read manually to identify the substrates and to map them to the compound ID from KEGG Ligand [17,18]. The substrate dataset can be classified into several common types of compounds: carbohydrates, lipids, peptides, amino acid, nucleic acids, vitamins, and hormones. In total, 37608 transporters with 15075 substrates from 884 organisms were collected. For accuracy, we only mapped substrates with clear descriptions to KEGG Ligand compound IDs. Transporters with ambiguous description such as "neutral amino acid" were included in the transporter dataset, but were not mapped to any KEGG compound. In addition to the formatted compound information in TSdb, we classified all the substrates according to their biochemical properties and biological functions; for example, enzyme effector, inhibitor, cofactor, GPCR ligand, ion ligand, P450 substrate or neurotransmitter.
    > Next, we retrieved and integrated extensive functional information about the transporters and their substrates from the public databases GeneRifs [19], UniProt [13,15], KEGG-Ligand 44.0 [18,20], BRENDA 7.1 [21], and HPRD [22]. For the transporters, protein functional annotation, such as subcellular localizations, protein family, gene ontology assignments, and known disease association, was collected from UniProt.

    > The pbmrp gene has an intronless ORF of 5820 nucleotides and is predicted to encode a protein comprised of 1939 amino acids. NCBI's Conserved Domain Database classified pbMRP as a member of the ABCC transporter subfamily (Figure 1a). Using the predicted pbMRP sequence, six homologues were identified in four Plasmodium species (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. knowlesi and P. y. yoelii) by sequence similarity searches in the PlasmoDB and in NCBI. We note that at the time the analyses were performed the annotation of the proteins at NCBI and Plas-moDB is only complete for the pfMRP2 and pfMRP1. For pvMRP1 and pvMRP2 the annotations are ABC transporter and multidrug-resistance associated protein, respectively.

    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > To obtain comprehensive gene function information, we performed gene function annotation using eight major databases, including UniProt [23], KEGG [24] and KEGG Pathway, GO [25], Pfam [26], COG [27], TIGERfams [28], RefSeq, and NR. The predicted gene sequences were aligned against functional databases such as COG, KEGG, UniProt, and RefSeq using BLAST+ (Version: 2.11.0+), resulting in the gene function annotation outcomes. The statistical results of the annotations are shown in Table S2. Among the top 20 domains annotated based on Pfam, we observed that genes belonging to "ABC transporters" were the most abundant (Figure 2A). As we know, ABC transporters comprise a large superfamily of proteins that facilitate the translocation of a diverse array of substrates, including ions and macromolecules, across cellular membranes through ATP binding and hydrolysis. Furthermore, these transporters are also critically involved in the cellular uptake and efflux of numerous organic pollutants [29,30]. These results suggest that the abundance of ABC transporter genes provides Paracoccus sp. P-2 with a significant capacity for deltamethrin transport. As shown in Figure 2B, the genes annotated by KEGG are divided into 5 major categories and 23 minor subcategories. Among them, the subcategory with the largest number of genes is metabolic pathways, which include amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, among others. The abundance of genes related to metabolic pathways provides the fundamental basis for the survival and deltamethrin degradation capability of Paracoccus sp. P-2. It is worth noting that a substantial number (254) of membrane transporter genes have been annotated in the genome of Paracoccus sp. P-2. Pollutants are often adsorbed onto the microbial membrane surface and subsequently internalized into the cells-a process in which membrane transporter proteins play a crucial role [31]. This abundance of transporter genes highlights the strain's strong capacity for pollutant transport.
