## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88BZ8
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Metal RND efflux outer membrane protein, CzcC family {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70950.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=czcC {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70950.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_5385 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70950.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the outer membrane factor (OMF) (TC 1.B.17)
- **Key Domains:** MdtP/NodT-like. (IPR010131); OMP_efflux. (IPR003423); OEP (PF02321)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "czcC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'czcC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **czcC** (gene ID: czcC, UniProt: Q88BZ8) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

- Summary: Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal primarily found as a by-product of zinc production. Cd was a proven carcinogen, and exposure to this metal has been linked to various adverse health effects, which were first reported in the mid-19th century and thoroughly investigated by the 20th century. The toxicokinetics and dynamics of Cd reveal its propensity for long biological retention and predominant storage in soft tissues. Until the 1950s, Cd pollution was caused by industrial activities, whereas nowa...

    > Four open reading frames (ORFs) were detected in the czc-DNA sequence. They are arranged on the czc operon as follows: first is the czcC gene (encodes a CzcC protein of 346 amino acids (AA) followed by the czcB gene (CzcB protein composed of 521 AA), the czcA gene (CzcA protein composed of 1064 AA), and the czcD gene (CzcD protein consisting of 200 AA) [45]. The second plasmid, pMOL28, encodes resistance to Ni 2+ and Co 2+ , increasing the MIC of Co 2+ by 16 times. This type of resistance is called the cnr gene, which encodes the CnrA protein. CzcA and CnrA proteins were the first proteins identified in the RND family. The resistance to Cd, along with cobalt and zinc, in the bacterium R. metallidurans (former name Alcaligenes eutrophus) is shown in Figure 3.   2+ , and Co 2+ efflux system functioning as proton/cation antiporter consisting of inner membrane (CzcA), outer membrane (CzcC), and membrane fusion (CzcB) proteins functioning as a dimer [45].

    > Microorganisms may be exposed to a variety of exogenous environmental toxins, such as hydrocarbons and heavy metals, which may be of natural or anthropogenic origin and may be harmful if allowed to accumulate in bacterial cells [60]. Efflux pumps play key roles in the removal of these substrates. CzcCBA belongs to the family of heavy metal efflux (HME) RND pumps and are involved mainly in response to the export of Co 2+ , Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ (czc) [61]. Three-gene operon czcCBA is also a tripartite efflux system consisting of the three proteins CzcC, CzcB and CzcA. The genome possesses the czcC gene (B5J99_01260) that encodes the heavy metal RND efflux outer-membrane protein CzcC, the acrB gene (B5J99_01265) encoding metal cation efflux fusion protein CzcB and the czcA (B5J99_01270) encoding for heavy metal RND efflux inner-membrane protein CzcA, which form a CzcCBA pump (Figure 7). Comparative genomic analysis revealed that this putative czcCBA efflux pump operon is closely homologous to that of Caulobacter crescentus CB15 [55], where the czcC gene had 37.0% of similarity to the cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance gene of C. crescentus CB15, the czcB showed 56.4% of similarity to that of C. crescentus CB15 and the czcA gene showed 71.3% of similarity to that of C. crescentus CB15 (Table 3). Phylogenetic studies of CzcCBA efflux proteins have revealed that czcCBA homolog genes formed clades with members of efflux fusion proteins and inner-membrane proteins, respectively. Based on their placement in clades with czcCBA (Figure 10) and similarities with related proteins, the strain B. fulva T2 is likely to possess a CzcCBA pump.

    > Target genes outlined in Supplemental Table 3 and their corresponding gene cluster in Xcc Cf4B1 (NZ_ JAFFQM000000000.1) are visualized in Fig. 4. Genes were annotated using RASTtk and Uniprot to assign the nearest best homolog protein and corresponding gene in the Xcc RefSeq genome (ATCC 33913). The czc cluster containing the czcB target is predicted to occur on a chromosomal contig (NZ_ JAFFQM010000094.1). This resolved contig containing this cluster was only 14.7 kb long with a single IS3 family transposase on one end and matched with >90% identity to complete Xcc chromosomes. MDR efflux clusters from the RND (4A, 4B, 4G, 4H [czcB and cusA], 4I [ABC_29]) and czcB (chromosomal), MFS (4E and 4J) and ABC (4C, 4D, 4F, 4K, 4L) superfamilies are represented in Fig. 4. Also depicted are the copLABMGF and ars operons (4H). Details on the MDR efflux gene clusters' (4A-4L) annotated functions, efflux pump superfamily and predicted metal-binding sites are given in Supplemental Table 16. Complete (100%) coverage with 97-100% sequence ID across multiple NCBI Xcc genomes were noted for all gene clusters, except 1H, and with Uniprot entries matching genome annotations.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Given a set of predicted protein-coding genes for a newly sequenced genome, functional annotation involves assigning putative functions to the predicted genes. Two ways in which this can be done are assigning protein names and Gene Ontology (GO;Gene Ontology Consortium, 2010) terms to the predicted proteins. Here we describe a computational pipeline for assigning protein names and GO terms to predicted proteins in parasitic worm (nematode and platyhelminth) genomes, which transfers names and GO terms from orthologues in other species.
    > When assigning protein names, UniProt protein naming rules (www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot) are followed where possible. This recommends that a good and stable name for a protein is "as neutral as possible"; that a protein name "should be, as far as possible, unique and attributed to all orthologs"; and a protein name "should not contain a specific characteristic of the protein, and in particular it should not reflect the function or role of the protein, nor its subcellular location, its domain structure, its tissue specificity, its molecular weight or its species of origin".
    > In our protocol, a protein name is assigned to each predicted protein based on curated names in UniProt (Bairoch & Apweiler, 2000) for human, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schistosoma mansoni orthologues identified from a database of gene families (e.g. built using Ensembl Compara; Vilella et al. 2009), or (if no information is found from orthologues) based on InterPro (Hunter et al. 2012) domains. Figure 1 shows an example of using our protein naming pipeline for four Strongyloides ratti genes that belong to the tubulin polyglutamylase family (underlined in pink), where four different protein names were assigned to them (in pink), based on names of their C. elegans or human orthologues.
    > Since each of the S. ratti genes belonged to a different subfamily of the tubulin polyglutamylase family, they were assigned different names.

    > PSPTO_0820 also showed high similarity to RND transporters of the AcrB/AcrD/AcrF family from other bacteria such as Azotobacter chroococcum (90% identity) and Paraburkholderia tuberum (87% identity), species which can be found in rhizosphere soils or nitrogen-fixing nodules on legume roots, respectively. We then decided to investigate whether PSPTO_0820 had a role in PsPto-plant interaction.
    > As mentioned above, the gene PSPTO_0820 is predicted to encode the inner membrane protein component of a RND family transporter. The gene context of PSPTO_0820 (Fig 1A ) suggests that this gene is part of an operon, since it overlaps 4 bp with the upstream  PSPTO_0821 gene. This gene would encode the MFP component of the system. However, no gene coding for an outer membrane efflux protein was present in the vicinity of these genes. This resembles the situation observed in the E. coli AcrAB-TolC tripartite efflux pump, where the acrAB genes are cotranscribed but the gene encoding the outer membrane component of the pump, tolC, is located elsewhere on the chromosome [12]. A search for proteins belonging to the outer membrane efflux protein family (Pfam family PF02321) was carried out in PsPto genome. The result of the search is depicted in Table 3. Nine putative candidates were found, of which seven were adjacent to different transporters from the RND or ATP-binding cassette (ABC) families. From the two remaining candidates, PSPTO_4977 was the most similar protein to E. coli TolC and it was well-conserved within the genus (S3 Using an arrayed transposon mutant library of PsPto, we isolated two mutants in PSPTO_0820 and PSPTO_4977 genes (named PS0820 and PS4977, respectively). A schematic view of the transposon location in the disrupted genes is shown in Fig 1 . We then proceeded to characterize these two strains.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information.

The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn.

    > Gene nomenclature contains current official symbols and various numbers of synonyms, which pose a challenge to integrating genomic data and increase the probability that different genes share the same symbol. Therefore, we retrieved identifiers assigned to all protein-coding genes in human, mouse, rat and pig genomes that are available in the Ensembl genome browser (release 113) to assess the number of genes, compare species and identify ambiguous symbols. Results: Our analysis revealed that the total number of symbols, both official symbols and synonyms, used to identify protein-coding genes ranges from 16,600 in pigs to 64,580 in mice. Furthermore, the gene nomenclature is not complete because there are also genes without an assigned symbol, which indicates gaps in understanding protein-coding genes, especially in pigs. We also found a large number of gene symbols that map to more than one gene. These symbols might complicate the identification of about 10% of rat and mouse genes and 18% of human protein-coding genes. A simple solution for this problem is the usage of stable gene IDs assigned by scientific institutions and committees (Ensembl, NCBI, RGD, HGNC and VGNC) provided that the genomic information associated with these IDs is retrieved directly from proprietary databases containing the most accurate data. Finally, although gene symbols may pose a problem with unequivocal identification of genes, there are instances when no other identifiers are available in the literature. Therefore, we have developed an R script performing search of the Ensembl database and integrating data to provide a single list of updated symbols with annotation about their ambiguity. Conclusions: Gene symbols are not always reliable and should be reported together with stable IDs to enable unequivocal identification of genes. Therefore, data containing only gene symbols should be used cautiously to avoid misidentification of genes. A solution for this problem is our R script REgeness that performs a gene symbol update to current official versions combined with identification of ambiguous symbols and retrieval of other IDs from the Ensembl database.

    > Sequence similarity analyses were accomplished using blastx [26] against the NCBI non-redundant database on protein level [32], the Swissprot database [33,34] and KEGG [35]. Additionally, manual gene annotation was performed using PRIAM [36], Motif Scan [37], Prosite  [38], BRENDA [39,40], UniProt/SwissProt [34], Inter-ProScan [41], and Pfam [42] databases. One example of how our manual annotation differed from that of the automated pipeline used by Brown et al. can be found in the case of CLAU_3519 (CAETHG_3609). Here the automated pipeline from the Brown et al. finished genome assigned this gene product as a hypothetical protein, however when the sequence was aligned using BLASTP as part of our manual curation all other proteins with >75 % identity were named sodium ABC transporter. Upon further inspection in Pfam, one large ABC-2 family transporter protein domain was found (E-value 6.8e-31). Similar searches of UniProt and KEGG databases agreed with Pfam, therefore we annotated this gene product as an ABC-2 family transporter. The correction of the previously short-called homopolymer reads through our sequencing efforts gave a fully annotated finished sequence of C. autoethanogenum without the erroneous frame-shift containing annotations which had occurred previously. Using these tools we were able to manually curate the entire genome to ensure that the automated annotation was correct and to insert additional information where required, as well as implementing a standardised protein product naming system as recommend by the NCBI guidelines [43] for ease of identification of genes with related functions. As a consequence of the automated and subsequent manual curation, we have found 482 instances across the genome where genes previously identified as 'hypothetical protein' have either been assigned a specific function, or have been named through identification of conserved domains based on sequence similarity.

Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.
