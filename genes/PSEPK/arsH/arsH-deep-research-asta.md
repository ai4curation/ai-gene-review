## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88JD4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=NADPH-dependent FMN reductase ArsH {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00073853}; AltName: Full=Arsenical resistance operon protein ArsH {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00081288};
- **Gene Information:** Name=arsH {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68323.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_2715 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68323.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ArsH family.
- **Key Domains:** Arsenate-R_ArsH. (IPR014063); Flavoprotein-like_sf. (IPR029039); FMN_Rdtase-like_dom. (IPR005025); FMN_red (PF03358)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "arsH" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'arsH' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **arsH** (gene ID: arsH, UniProt: Q88JD4) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > The protein sequences were functionally annotated by combining information retrieved from the UniProt database ( [25], accessed on 9 June 2022) and one-to-one fast orthology assignments using the eggNOG-mapper v.2.1.7 tool ( [26], accessed on 9 June 2022), as described in [27]. Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > The BLASTx homology search tool, a component of the standalone NCBI-blast-2.3.0+, was used to perform functional annotation of the F. udum genes (Altschul et al., 1990). With a cut-off E value of ≤1e−06 and a similarity of 34%, BLASTx identified the homologous sequences of the genes in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using Blast2GO PRO 4.1.5 (Conesa and Gotz, 2008). In three different mappings, B2G performed as follows: (1) Using two NCBI-provided mapping files, blast result accessions are used to get gene names (symbols; gene info, gene 2 accessions). (2) Blast result GI identifiers were used to retrieve UniProt IDs using a mapping file from PIR (non-redundant reference protein database), which includes PSD, Swiss-Prot, UniProt, TrEMBL, GenPept, RefSeq, and PDB. The names of the identified genes were searched in the species-specific entries of the gene product table of the GO database. With the aid of the KAAS-KEGG Automatic Annotation Server, pathway analyses were carried out. This database provides functional annotation of genes using other data servers (Moriya et al., 2007). Accessions from the blast results were looked for in the DBXRef table of the GO database.

The P. denitrificans ars operon-like gene clusters are of the arsRCBH type, where arsR codes for a putative repressor, arsC for an As(V) reductase, arsB for an As(III) efflux pump and arsH for a flavin reductase. These clusters (genes 3131 to 3136 and 3337 to 3342) were denoted as ars1 and ars2. The predicted protein products of arsH1 and arsH2 genes (pden_3133 and 3339) are composed of 235 amino acids and display 100% sequence identity with each other. There is also significant sequence homology with the most intensively studied ArsH proteins from other organisms (Figure S1).

Cytochrome c, produced by a posttranslational process, consists of heme-containing proteins important for cellular energy production and signaling. 28,29 The arsD controls the maximal expression of the arsenic-resistant operon (arsRDABC). 43 The ArsD metallochaperone protein delivers arsenite to ArsA efflux pump. 44,45 he significance of the adjacency of cytochrome c biogenesis protein and the metallochaperone needs further investigation. In Shewanella putrefaciens strain CN-2, a subunit of c-type cytochrome (CymA) that is present in anaerobic conditions functions in conjunction with a known respiratory arsenate reductase. 46 hrough additional functional annotation data curation, we noted the presence of a gene for mercuric transport protein (Locus Tag: BT_0113; UniProt Accession: Q8ABJ7) in one of the BioCyc transcription units (TUJXV-83) of the B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 (Fig. 4).

These genes encode function for sensing and/or regulating (resistance) arsenic content in the bacterial cell. 19 The best-characterized arsenic genes include As(III)responsive transcriptional repressor (arsR), anion-transporting ATPase (arsA), arsenical pump membrane protein (arsB), arsenate reductase and related proteins, glutaredoxin family (arsC), arsenical resistance operon trans-acting repressor (arsD), arylsulfatase family, member H (arsH), putative membrane permease (ArsP), and As(III)-S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (arsM). 20 The genes for conversion of arsenate to arsenite and arsenite extrusion from the cell are typically organized as operons, such as arsRBC, arsRABC, and arsRDABC, but the genes can also exist alone. 20 Proteins for water and/or glycerol transport across cellular membranes termed aquaporins can also function in arsenic transport. 21 3][24] The domain architecture of USPs can be (i) one USP domain, (ii) two USP domains in tandem, or (iii) one or two USP domains together with other functional domains including transporters, kinases, permeases, transferases, and bacterial sensor. 24,25 In Exiguobacterium sp. PS, a Gram-positive bacteria that lacks arsenic reductase activity, a USP was induced by arsenate stress. 26 The uspA of Escherichia coli has been evaluated as a sensor to detect chemical toxicants. 27 he availability of diverse data from HMP allows for secondary data analytics including constructing profiles of functional annotations for genes involved in arsenic sensing and regulation in the HMP genomes collection. Therefore, we report the development of a genome profiling scheme based on the availability of functional annotations for seven Pfam protein families, including known arsenic resistance operon proteins, aquaporins, and USPs.

Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > Bioinformatics Databases. DEG is a database of essential genes (http://www. essentialgene.org/). The newly released DEG 10 has been developed to accommodate the quantitative and qualitative advancements brought by the progressive identification methods. Currently available records of both essential and nonessential genes among a wide range of organisms can be downloaded from DEG 10, making it possible to compare the two different types of genes in many aspects 21 .
    > 27 prokaryotic organisms including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and Methanococcus maripaludis S2, the only record of the Archaea domain were selected to analyze the protein localization and GO distribution of the essential and nonessential genes. There are 31 bacterial records corresponding to 27 organisms in the database in total and 26 sets of data were selected in the current study. Streptococcus pneumonia was not chosen for the lack of non-essential genes. Since the essential genes were not genome-widely identified, it's not reasonable to regard the complementary set of essential genes as non-essential genes in Streptococcus pneumonia 29,30 . In the case of multiple records for one organism, the one with the most convincing experimental methods was chosen. The non-essential genes in Methanococcus maripaludis S2 and 13 bacteria such as Escherichia coli MG1655 are obtained based on the original literatures, while non-essential genes in other 12 organisms such as Bacillus subtilis 168 are the complementary set of essential genes. The information of the organisms used in the current study are displayed in Table 1.
    > The three model genomes' subcellular location information and the Gene Ontology (GO) terms used for the analysis in the current study were downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt; http://www.uniprot.org). Maintained by the UniProt Consortium, UniProt is committed to providing biologists with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and functional annotation 27 . Among the wealth of annotation data, detailed GO annotation statements are included.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > The NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), include protein sequence information from GenBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), SwissProt, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and Protein Research Foundation (PRF). The NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) are the nucleotide sequence database that includes nucleotide sequence from GenBank of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as cell, organism and ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. KEGG is an established Cluster of Orthologous (KO) annotation system that can accomplish the function annotation of the genome/transcriptome of a newly sequenced species. SwissProt is a manual annotated and reviewed protein sequence database that has a high-quality protein sequence database from experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions. Pfam is comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile of hidden Markov models. Many proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of a specific structural domain possesses a certain degree of conservative property. GO is the established standard for the functional annotation of gene products and controlled vocabulary used to classify the functional attributes of gene products of a biological process, a molecular function and a cellular component.

    > Of the 19,984 protein-coding genes in C. elegans, 10,838 have a name/gene symbol (e.g. lin-12). Gene naming is largely investigator-initiated, with a request to WormBase through genenames@wormbase.org ; this will continue with C. elegans content in the Alliance. The gene symbol, which is formatted in lowercase and italics, communicates information about the gene based on mutant phenotype, functional criteria, orthology, or homology. To make genes easily recognizable to non-elegans researchers, the current preference is to name genes with human orthologs after the human gene if characterized. Gene name stability and formatting are important to avoid confusion in the literature and to facilitate searches of other databases that use the C. elegans gene symbols (e.g. UniProt) and text mining. However, occasionally names have been changed because of incorrect orthology or not supported by functional studies from the community. Names have also been changed based on requests from multiple community members (e.g. daf-21 renamed as hsp-90). To avoid name changes and to have the published name used in databases, researchers should contact WormBase prior to manuscript submission; the most common issue is that the requested name is already in use in C. elegans or another model organism for a nonhomologous gene product. Over the past 10 years, the community has averaged 180 new gene names per year, often with a corresponding publication, increasing knowledge about our favorite organism. More information about C. elegans-specific nomenclature can be found at https://wormbase.org/about/ userguide/nomenclature.

    > Further the assembled transcript contigs were validated using CLC Genomics workbench (CLC Bio, Boston, MA 02108 USA) by mapping high quality reads back to the assembled transcript contigs. ORF-Predictor [57], an online tool, was used on default parameters to identify the coding DNA sequences (CDS) from assembled transcript contigs. GC counts of transcripts was determined using a custom-made perl script.
    > Functional annotations. The functional annotation was performed by aligning coding DNA sequence (CDS) to NCBI 'green plant database (txid 33090)' database using basic local alignment search tool (BLASTX) [58] with an E-value threshold of 1e -06 and GO assignments were used to classify the functions of the predicted CDS. The GO mapping also provided ontology of defined terms representing gene product properties which were grouped into three main domains: biological process (BP), molecular function (MF) and cellular component (CC). GO mapping was carried out in order to retrieve GO terms for all the BLASTX functionally annotated CDS. The GO mapping used defined criteria to retrieve GO terms for annotated CDS which included use of BLASTX result accession IDs to retrieve gene names or symbols, UniProt IDs and direct search in the dbxref table of GO database. Identified gene names or symbols were then searched in the species specific entries of the gene-product tables of GO database. UniProt IDs made use of protein information resource (PIR) which includes protein sequence database (PSD), UniProt, SwissProt, TrEMBL, RefSeq, GenPept, and PDB databases. Gene Ontology analysis helps in specifying all the annotated nodes comprising of GO functional groups. CDS were compared against the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) database for the analysis of phylogenetically widespread domain families. CDS were compared against Pfam database for higher-level groupings of related protein families, known as clans and the identification of domains that occurs within proteins. BLASTX was used against uniprot-swissprot database with cut-off e-value 1e-6 to annotate predicted CDS against protein.

Molecular function and biological processes GO term were investigated. Since UNIPROT-GOA offers automated annotation, the functions of candidate proteins were further verified, using the literature. Protein interaction analysis was performed by mapping UNIPROT accessions to gene names and searching them in the STRING database (version 11.5) versus the S. aureus protein interactions. Only interactions with a high confidence (minimum score of 0.70) were maintained in the network. The sources utilized for the generation of the networks were from neighborhood, experiments, gene fusion, databases, co-occurrence, and co-expression (textmining was excluded to increase accuracy). Disconnected nodes were not displayed in the networks.
