## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88PE4
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Multidrug efflux RND transporter {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66531.1};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_0906 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66531.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** AcrB_DN_DC_subdom. (IPR027463); Acrflvin-R. (IPR001036); ACR_tran (PF00873)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_0906" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_0906' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_0906** (gene ID: PP_0906, UniProt: Q88PE4) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Gene nomenclature contains current official symbols and various numbers of synonyms, which pose a challenge to integrating genomic data and increase the probability that different genes share the same symbol. Therefore, we retrieved identifiers assigned to all protein-coding genes in human, mouse, rat and pig genomes that are available in the Ensembl genome browser (release 113) to assess the number of genes, compare species and identify ambiguous symbols. Results: Our analysis revealed that the total number of symbols, both official symbols and synonyms, used to identify protein-coding genes ranges from 16,600 in pigs to 64,580 in mice. Furthermore, the gene nomenclature is not complete because there are also genes without an assigned symbol, which indicates gaps in understanding protein-coding genes, especially in pigs. We also found a large number of gene symbols that map to more than one gene. These symbols might complicate the identification of about 10% of rat and mouse genes and 18% of human protein-coding genes. A simple solution for this problem is the usage of stable gene IDs assigned by scientific institutions and committees (Ensembl, NCBI, RGD, HGNC and VGNC) provided that the genomic information associated with these IDs is retrieved directly from proprietary databases containing the most accurate data. Finally, although gene symbols may pose a problem with unequivocal identification of genes, there are instances when no other identifiers are available in the literature. Therefore, we have developed an R script performing search of the Ensembl database and integrating data to provide a single list of updated symbols with annotation about their ambiguity. Conclusions: Gene symbols are not always reliable and should be reported together with stable IDs to enable unequivocal identification of genes. Therefore, data containing only gene symbols should be used cautiously to avoid misidentification of genes. A solution for this problem is our R script REgeness that performs a gene symbol update to current official versions combined with identification of ambiguous symbols and retrieval of other IDs from the Ensembl database.

    > In contrast, 60 GO terms were overrepresented in dissociation relationships, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complex (GO:0043190; p=4.96e-52), and drug transmembrane transport (GO:0006855; p=2.16e-07) (Figure 3b blue points, Supplementary Table 2).
    > A subset of GO annotations was enriched in both associating and dissociating gene pairs (Figure 3b purple points; Supplementary Table 2). This appears counterintuitive, but may correspond to, for example, two multi-gene functional units that dissociate from one another but whose genes within the unit strongly associate with each other. For example, gene pairs annotated with transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0022857) were enriched in association (p=8.39e-06) and dissociation gene relationships (p=3.01e-28;
    > Figure 3c). While some genes formed independent co-occurring cliques or solitary dissociation patterns (not shown), the majority of genes clustered into groups of associating genes (Supplementary Figure 8a) that dissociated from each other (Figure 3c). Some of these cluster avoidance patterns appear to be largely due to species boundaries (e.g. clusters 7 and 15; Supplementary Figure 8b) but most are independent of phylogeny and syntenic relationships (Supplementary Figure 8bc). Although many of these genes are hypothetical or only loosely annotated, there are, for example, genes for an efflux pump (Resistancenodulation-division (RND) family transporters) in cluster 2 that dissociate from genes for a different efflux pump (glutathione-regulated potassium-efflux system protein, KefB) in cluster 3 (Supplementary Table 3), indicating a possible example of functional redundancy or niche partitioning within this system.
    > The above calculations of intersecting GO annotations rely on known gene information.

    > To obtain basic information on WERs and their target genes, such as official gene symbols, gene IDs, gene types, and genomic locations, gene annotations were downloaded from the GENCODE project [ 44 ] for human and mouse, and from NCBI [ 45 ] and Ensembl [ 46 ] for the other species. Genomic locations were extracted from the corresponding GTF annotation files. Gene symbols were primarily standardized based on the NCBI Gene database [ 45 ] for mRNAs and lncRNAs, GtR-NAdb [ 47 ] for tRNAs, miRbase [ 48 ] for microRNAs, and cir-cBase [ 49 ] for circRNAs. Deprecated or substituted versions of genes were filtered out. The LiftOver [ 50 ] program was employed to convert and unify genomic coordinates across different genome assembly versions.
    > The functional descriptions of WERs were compiled based on the UniProt database [ 51 ] and further supplemented with evidence from relevant publications, with particular emphasis on their functions as RNA modification regulatory proteins.

    > Many public databases of gene information are available (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16). However, different public databases often use different sets of unique identifiers (IDs) to describe the same genes or homologous genes in different species. One challenge of comparing large-scale biological datasets is the unification of gene names; otherwise, researchers spend a lot of effort in converting gene IDs when searching different databases. Another is the likelihood of missing some databases due to unfamiliarity; this is particularly true for clinicians and researchers who are specialized in inner ear research but are not necessarily familiar with genomics and bioinformatics. One goal of the SHIELD is to integrate relevant gene annotation information from various public databases in one centralized location.
    > For the SHIELD, annotations were derived from public databases and literature. Currently implemented annotations include official gene symbols, description of the gene name and synonyms, human and mouse chromosome cytogenetic banding, RefSeq RNA and protein (for protein coding genes) accession numbers, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez gene ID, genomic coordinates in both mouse reference genome assemblies mm9 and mm10, Ensembl, the Vertebrate Genome Annotation Database (VEGA) Mouse Genome Informatics, UniProt, Online Mendalian Inheritance in Man and gene ontology.
    > For each protein coding genes, we display all UniProt protein isoforms for that gene, the length in amino acid residues and the predicted number of transmembrane domains (TMs). We predicted TMs by running TMHMM2.0 run on all UniProt protein isoforms of each gene (17). The number of TMs is of special interest for research in sensory function, because many key proteins involved in signaling-such as the mechanotransduction ion channels-are integral membrane proteins. This information would help identify candidate genes for the components of the mechanotransduction apparatus of the inner ear.
    > We also performed manual curation of inner ear disorders including syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss according to the Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org) and primary literature.

Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.
