  label: Pseudomonas putida KT2440
description: Lanthanide-dependent pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase that catalyzes the oxidation of alcohols and aldehydes in the periplasm. Essential for bacterial growth on volatile organic compounds as carbon and energy sources. Shows absolute dependence on lanthanide cofactors and uses cytochrome c550 as electron acceptor. Also functions in transcriptional regulation as a lanthanide sensory module.

- term:
    id: GO:0005509
    label: calcium ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'Incorrect annotation. PedH is lanthanide-dependent, not calcium-dependent. This annotation likely arose from sequence similarity to other PQQ dehydrogenases. PedH requires La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+ etc. for activity, but not Ca2+.'

    label: membrane
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: 'Too vague and potentially misleading. PedH is a periplasmic protein, not membrane-associated. While it has a signal peptide for periplasmic targeting, it is a soluble enzyme in the periplasm, not membrane-bound.'

    label: oxidoreductase activity, acting on CH-OH group of donors
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: 'Accurate but too general. This correctly describes the broad enzymatic activity but lacks specificity about the PQQ-dependence and cytochrome c as electron acceptor. The more specific term GO:0052934 is present and preferred.'

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: 'Correct but overly specific. This is accurate for the periplasmic localization but the simpler GO:0042597 periplasmic space is also present and more commonly used. Both are correct but GO:0042597 is preferred for simplicity.'

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'Too general and uninformative. While technically correct, this term provides no specific functional information. The more specific terms GO:0052934 and GO:0016614 are present and much more informative.'

    label: heme binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: 'Incorrect annotation. PedH does not bind heme directly. It uses cytochrome c550 as an external electron acceptor, but PedH itself is not a heme-containing protein. This annotation likely arose from automated inference errors.'

    label: periplasmic space
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'Correct and well-supported. PedH has a signal peptide and is localized to the periplasm where it functions in alcohol oxidation. This is a core cellular component annotation.'

    label: metal ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'Correct but too general. PedH specifically binds lanthanide ions (La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+) which are essential for activity. A more specific lanthanide binding term would be preferable if available.'
    action: ACCEPT

    label: alcohol dehydrogenase (cytochrome c) activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'Excellent and highly specific annotation. This perfectly describes PedH function - it is an alcohol dehydrogenase that uses cytochrome c (specifically cytochrome c550) as electron acceptor. This is the core molecular function annotation.'
    action: ACCEPT
- term:
    id: GO:0070968
    label: pyrroloquinoline quinone binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: 'Perfect annotation. PedH absolutely requires PQQ as a cofactor (1:1 stoichiometry) for all catalytic activity. This is well-supported by crystal structure data showing specific PQQ binding sites. Core molecular function.'
    action: ACCEPT
