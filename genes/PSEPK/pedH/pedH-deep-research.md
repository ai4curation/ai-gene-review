# **pedH** Gene (Pseudomonas putida KT2440) – Comprehensive Annotation Report

## Function and Molecular Mechanism  
The **pedH** gene of *P. putida* KT2440 encodes a pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (PQQ-ADH) that is notable for its **lanthanide-dependent enzyme activity** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=characterization%20of%20a%20lanthanide,Notably)). PedH (locus tag PP_2679) catalyzes the periplasmic oxidation of a broad range of alcohols – including linear aliphatic alcohols, aromatic alcohols such as 2-phenylethanol, secondary alcohols, and even some aldehydes – into their corresponding aldehydes or acids ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=organism%20Pseudomonas%20putida%20KT2440,Notably)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=amine%2C%20its%20deamination%20to%20phenylacetaldehyde,PqqABCDEF%20and)). This enzyme uses PQQ as a redox cofactor and requires **trivalent lanthanide ions** (e.g. La³⁺, Ce³⁺, Nd³⁺) in its active site for catalysis, in contrast to its homolog PedE which is Ca²⁺-dependent ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=organism%20Pseudomonas%20putida%20KT2440,little%20as%201%20to%2010%C2%A0nM)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=to%20other%20characterized%20representatives%20of,this%20residue%20is%20an%20aspartate)). A critical active-site residue substitution (Asp in PedH vs Ser in PedE) enables PedH to coordinate lanthanides and confers its lanthanide reliance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=to%20other%20characterized%20representatives%20of,this%20residue%20is%20an%20aspartate)). Mechanistically, PedH oxidizes alcohol substrates by transferring electrons via PQQ to an electron acceptor (a cytochrome c component), linking alcohol catabolism to the respiratory chain ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=for%20its%20oxidation%20to%20phenylacetic,whereas%20CcmABCDEFGHI%20is%20required%20for)). Purified PedH is enzymatically inactive without lanthanides but, upon addition of La³⁺ or other light rare earth metals, it exhibits robust dehydrogenase activity, often with kinetics (V_max and specific activity) exceeding those of the Ca²⁺-dependent PedE ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=organism%20Pseudomonas%20putida%20KT2440,little%20as%201%20to%2010%C2%A0nM)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=match%20at%20L249%20Under%20optimized,metal%20cofactor%20differed%20dramatically%20for)). These characteristics establish PedH as the first described **lanthanide-dependent quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase** in a non-methylotrophic bacterium ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=pyrroloquinoline%20quinone,assays%20revealed%20that%20PedH%20not)). In summary, PedH functions as a PQQ-containing oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.2.8, quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase) that plays a key role in oxidizing a variety of volatile and aromatic alcohols into aldehydes, using lanthanide cofactors for its catalytic activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=organism%20Pseudomonas%20putida%20KT2440,little%20as%201%20to%2010%C2%A0nM)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=lanthanum%2C%20a%20concentration%20assumed%20to,the%20availability%20of%20different%20lanthanides)). *Molecular Function GO terms*: **quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase activity** (PQQ-dependent ethanol/alcohol dehydrogenase), **PQQ binding**, **metal ion binding** (lanthanide ion binding).

## Cellular Localization and Components  
PedH is a **periplasmic enzyme** associated with the inner membrane periplasmic space of *P. putida*. It is synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide that directs its export to the periplasm, where it folds and incorporates the PQQ cofactor (and metal ion) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=amine%2C%20its%20deamination%20to%20phenylacetaldehyde,PqqABCDEF%20and)). In the periplasm, PedH functions together with a periplasmic c-type cytochrome electron carrier to relay electrons into the respiratory chain ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=for%20its%20oxidation%20to%20phenylacetic,whereas%20CcmABCDEFGHI%20is%20required%20for)). The ped gene cluster includes a small **cytochrome c** component required for electron transfer from PedH to cytochrome oxidases ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=for%20its%20oxidation%20to%20phenylacetic,whereas%20CcmABCDEFGHI%20is%20required%20for)). PedH itself is a soluble **periplasmic quinoprotein dehydrogenase**, not anchored in the membrane, though it operates at the periplasmic interface of the cytoplasmic membrane. Experimental and bioinformatic analyses indicate PedH is exported likely via the Sec pathway (or TAT pathway if cofactor-loaded), ensuring its localization in the periplasmic compartment where its alcohol substrates (which can cross the outer membrane) are available ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=for%20its%20oxidation%20to%20phenylacetic,whereas%20CcmABCDEFGHI%20is%20required%20for)). There is no evidence that PedH is present in the cytosol or external medium; its activity in oxidizing alcohols occurs in the periplasmic space, consistent with the need to pass electrons to periplasmic cytochromes and ultimately to the electron transport chain ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=for%20its%20oxidation%20to%20phenylacetic,whereas%20CcmABCDEFGHI%20is%20required%20for)). *Cellular Component GO terms*: **periplasmic space**, **intracellular membrane-bounded periplasmic space** (periplasmic side of inner membrane), **quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase complex** (periplasmic enzyme complex with PQQ and cytochrome c).  

## Biological Processes Involvement  
**PedH is integral to aromatic alcohol catabolism and detoxification** in *Pseudomonas putida*. It is part of the **2-phenylethanol degradation (Ped) pathway**, which converts 2-phenylethanol into phenylacetaldehyde and onward to phenylacetic acid ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=conversion%20of%202,cytochrome%20c%2C%20a%20periplasmic%20binding)). The ped cluster (genes *pedS1R1ABCS2R2DEFGHI*) encodes the complete upper pathway for 2-phenylethanol utilization, including transport and two PQQ-ADHs (PedE and PedH) that perform the initial oxidation step ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=a%20phenylacetaldehyde%20dehydrogenase,the%20biosynthesis%20of%20pyrroloquinoline%20quinone)). PedH specifically oxidizes 2-phenylethanol to phenylacetaldehyde (in the presence of lanthanides), which is then further oxidized by the aldehyde dehydrogenase PedI to phenylacetic acid ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=amine%2C%20its%20deamination%20to%20phenylacetaldehyde,PqqABCDEF%20and)). This pathway feeds into the phenylacetyl-CoA catabolon (Paa pathway) for complete mineralization of aromatic compounds ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=electrons%20to%20an%20independent%20cytochrome,routes%20belonging%20to%20the%20phenylacetyl)). Beyond aromatic alcohols, PedH (along with PedE) also contributes to the metabolism of other growth substrates: for example, both enzymes were shown to oxidize **ethylene glycol** to glycolaldehyde, initiating ethylene glycol catabolism in *P. putida* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=acid,glyoxylic%20acid%20from%20ethylene%20glycol)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=31,3)). More generally, the redundant PedE/PedH system is crucial for growth on various **volatile organic compounds** (VOCs) as sole carbon sources ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=lanthanum%2C%20a%20concentration%20assumed%20to,the%20availability%20of%20different%20lanthanides)). Mutant studies demonstrate that *P. putida* requires at least one of these PQQ-ADH enzymes to efficiently grow on primary alcohols; in their absence, or if the wrong metal cofactor is available, growth is impaired ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=lanthanum%2C%20a%20concentration%20assumed%20to,the%20availability%20of%20different%20lanthanides)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6115532/#:~:text=As%20a%20consequence%20of%20the,overcome%20the%20repression%20of%20pedE)). Thus, PedH enables *P. putida* to utilize a broad spectrum of alcohols (including environmental pollutants and plant-derived aromatics) by oxidizing them to aldehydes for further metabolism ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=organism%20Pseudomonas%20putida%20KT2440,little%20as%201%20to%2010%C2%A0nM)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=acid,glyoxylic%20acid%20from%20ethylene%20glycol)). *Biological Process GO terms*: **2-phenylethanol catabolic process**, **ethanol metabolic process** (ethanol oxidation), **aromatic compound catabolic process**, **ether/alcohol metabolic process**, **response to alcohol** (induction by presence of alcohol substrate), **volatile organic compound catabolic process**.  

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
There are **no known direct disease associations** for the *pedH* gene, as *Pseudomonas putida* KT2440 is a non-pathogenic soil bacterium commonly used in biotechnology and bioremediation. *P. putida* generally does not cause disease in healthy organisms, and pedH’s function is linked to environmental nutrient utilization rather than virulence. However, *P. putida* can be an opportunistic pathogen in rare cases; even in those scenarios, pedH is not implicated in pathogenicity or host interaction. Instead, the importance of pedH is seen in **metabolic phenotypes**. Notably, a Δ*pedH* knockout strain exhibits a specific growth defect on certain substrates under lanthanide-rich conditions: in the presence of lanthanum (which represses the alternate enzyme PedE), a *pedH*-null mutant fails to grow on 2-phenylethanol as sole carbon source ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6115532/#:~:text=As%20a%20consequence%20of%20the,overcome%20the%20repression%20of%20pedE)). This phenotype reflects PedH’s essential role in alcohol utilization when lanthanides are available – without PedH, *P. putida* cannot effectively oxidize 2-phenylethanol (or similar alcohols) if PedE is downregulated ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6115532/#:~:text=As%20a%20consequence%20of%20the,overcome%20the%20repression%20of%20pedE)). In contrast, under calcium-only conditions (no lanthanides), a *pedH* mutant can still grow on alcohols because PedE compensates. Aside from carbon source utilization phenotypes, there are no reported morphological or viability defects associated with pedH disruption. In summary, **pedH is not linked to human disease**, but its deletion yields a metabolic phenotype: inability to catabolize certain alcohols when reliance on lanthanide-dependent dehydrogenase is required ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6115532/#:~:text=As%20a%20consequence%20of%20the,overcome%20the%20repression%20of%20pedE)). *(No specific GO disease terms; phenotypic effect relates to metabolic process failure under certain conditions.)*

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
PedH is a **quinoprotein dehydrogenase** belonging to the family of Type II PQQ-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). Its primary structure contains an N-terminal signal peptide (for periplasmic targeting) followed by a large **eight-bladed β-propeller domain** that harbors the PQQ prosthetic group ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cd10279#:~:text=%3F%20%204%C2%A0PQQ_ADH_II%C2%A0Download%20alignment%20PQQ_like,Proteobacteria%20%20PubMed%3A%20%208)). This β-propeller fold forms the active site pocket where PQQ is non-covalently bound and where substrate oxidation occurs ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cd10279#:~:text=%3F%20%204%C2%A0PQQ_ADH_II%C2%A0Download%20alignment%20PQQ_like,Proteobacteria%20%20PubMed%3A%20%208)). The active site also binds a metal ion cofactor: PedH’s cofactor preference is for lanthanides (Ln³⁺) due to a conserved Asp residue in the coordination sphere, whereas Ca²⁺ cannot adequately activate the enzyme ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=to%20other%20characterized%20representatives%20of,this%20residue%20is%20an%20aspartate)). A key **active-site Aspartate (Asp)** (in place of the Serine found in Ca²⁺-dependent enzymes) is responsible for coordinating the lanthanide ion and is critical for PedH’s catalytic activity with Ln³⁺ ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=to%20other%20characterized%20representatives%20of,this%20residue%20is%20an%20aspartate)). PedH is a **monomeric or homodimeric enzyme** in solution; like other quinoprotein ADHs (e.g. ExaA of *P. aeruginosa*), PedH likely forms a homodimer in the periplasm, with each subunit binding one PQQ and one metal ion ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/Q9Z4J7#:~:text=Quinoprotein%20ethanol%20dehydrogenase%20,strain%20ATCC%2015692)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=31,3)). Unlike some quinohemoproteins, PedH does *not* contain a covalently bound heme c within its polypeptide; instead, electron transfer is mediated by an external c-type cytochrome (encoded separately in the cluster) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=for%20its%20oxidation%20to%20phenylacetic,whereas%20CcmABCDEFGHI%20is%20required%20for)). In the PedH sequence, motifs characteristic of PQQ-binding enzymes are present (such as the conserved glutamate and tyrosine residues that interact with PQQ) and a conserved His-x-[Ser/Asp]-x-x-Gly motif that helps ligate the metal ion. No transmembrane regions are present, consistent with PedH being periplasmic and soluble. Additionally, PedH’s amino acid composition gives it a relatively basic isoelectric point (pI ~8.7) ([journals.asm.org](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aem.02062-12#:~:text=corresponding%20genes%20PP_2664%20to%20PP_2680,75%2C%20while%20PedE)), which may facilitate interaction with acidic cytochromes in the periplasm. Overall, PedH’s structural features include its signal peptide, PQQ-binding β-propeller domain, a metal-binding active site tuned for lanthanides, and the capability to interact with partner electron carriers. *Key domains*: **PQQ-dependent ADH domain** (8-blade propeller), **lanthanide-binding site** (Asp-containing loop), and regions for dimer interface and cytochrome interaction. *Protein Domain GO terms*: **pyrroloquinoline quinone binding**, **metal ion binding**, **beta-propeller domain** (structure), **electron transfer activity** (via cytochrome interaction).

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
Expression of *pedH* is tightly regulated and context-dependent, involving two distinct regulatory systems. First, **substrate-induced regulation** is mediated by the PedS1/PedR1 two-component system, which responds to the presence of 2-phenylethanol or related aromatic substrates ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=a%20phenylacetaldehyde%20dehydrogenase,the%20biosynthesis%20of%20pyrroloquinoline%20quinone)). When 2-phenylethanol is available, the sensor kinase PedS1 and response regulator PedR1 activate transcription of the ped cluster (including *pedE*, *pedH*, *pedI*, etc.), ensuring the enzymes needed for 2-phenylethanol uptake and oxidation are produced ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=a%20phenylacetaldehyde%20dehydrogenase,the%20biosynthesis%20of%20pyrroloquinoline%20quinone)). Consequently, *pedH* mRNA and PedH protein are strongly induced during growth on 2-phenylethanol as a carbon source (and also induced by structurally similar alcohols or volatile compounds) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=a%20phenylacetaldehyde%20dehydrogenase,the%20biosynthesis%20of%20pyrroloquinoline%20quinone)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=acid,glyoxylic%20acid%20from%20ethylene%20glycol)). In addition to substrate-dependent control, *pedH* is subject to the **“lanthanide switch” regulatory system**: the PedS2/PedR2 two-component system senses rare-earth elements and inversely regulates *pedH* and *pedE* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=The%20measured%20amounts%20of%20cell,response%20to%20different%20Ln%20elements)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6115532/#:~:text=As%20a%20consequence%20of%20the,overcome%20the%20repression%20of%20pedE)). In the absence of lanthanides, the Ca²⁺-dependent *pedE* gene is expressed at high levels while *pedH* is kept low; when lanthanide ions (e.g. La³⁺ at nanomolar levels) are present, PedS2/R2 represses *pedE* and strongly induces *pedH* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=The%20measured%20amounts%20of%20cell,response%20to%20different%20Ln%20elements)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6115532/#:~:text=As%20a%20consequence%20of%20the,overcome%20the%20repression%20of%20pedE)). This dual control optimizes the bacterium’s alcohol oxidation system for the available cofactor: PedH is preferentially produced under lanthanide-rich conditions, whereas PedE dominates when only calcium is available ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=The%20measured%20amounts%20of%20cell,response%20to%20different%20Ln%20elements)). Interestingly, PedH itself appears to have a feedback role in regulation – it has been suggested that PedH (perhaps via its cofactor-loaded state or activity) aids in sensing lanthanides and fine-tuning expression of the *pedE/pedH* genes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=Ce,KT2440%20to%20optimize%20growth%20with)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=The%20measured%20amounts%20of%20cell,response%20to%20different%20Ln%20elements)). Reporter gene assays show that *pedH* promoter activity is extremely sensitive to trace lanthanum, aligning with PedH’s role in a high-affinity lanthanide response network ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=Ce,KT2440%20to%20optimize%20growth%20with)). Moreover, global transcriptomic and proteomic studies confirm that *pedH* is highly upregulated when cells are grown on alcohols like ethylene glycol or 2-phenylethanol, and that this induction is modulated by lanthanide availability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=acid,glyoxylic%20acid%20from%20ethylene%20glycol)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=The%20measured%20amounts%20of%20cell,response%20to%20different%20Ln%20elements)). In summary, *pedH* expression is **induced by substrate (alcohol) presence and regulated by lanthanide levels** via two dedicated two-component systems, ensuring the right dehydrogenase is expressed for efficient metabolism. *Regulation GO terms*: **response to alcohol** (transcriptional induction by 2-phenylethanol/ethanol), **response to metal ion** (lanthanide sensing), **positive regulation of gene expression by metal ions** (lanthanide activates *pedH* expression), **two-component signal transduction system** involvement.  

## Evolutionary Conservation  
The ped gene cluster and PedH protein are conserved among certain groups of pseudomonads and related bacteria. *P. putida* KT2440’s PedH is almost identical (99% amino acid identity) to **PedH in *P. putida* strain U**, which first defined the phenylethanol degradation (Ped) pathway ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=31,3)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=P.%20putida%20U%20%20,88%20%28ExaC)). This indicates that the ped cluster has been maintained with little divergence in these strains, likely due to its adaptive value in utilizing aromatic compounds. *PedH* also shows significant homology to PQQ-dependent ethanol dehydrogenases in other species. For instance, *P. putida* PedH shares ~52% identity with **ExaA** (the quinoprotein ethanol dehydrogenase of *P. aeruginosa*) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=31,3)). Notably, PedE (the Ca²⁺-dependent counterpart) is more closely related to ExaA (84% identity), whereas PedH is more divergent ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=31,3)). This suggests that the lineage leading to PedH acquired unique adaptations (like lanthanide use) not present in the single ADH of *P. aeruginosa*. Homologs of PedH (lanthanide-dependent PQQ-ADHs) are now known in other non-methylotrophic bacteria as well, hinting at convergent evolution of lanthanide utilization. Within the *Pseudomonas putida* species complex and closely related *Pseudomonas* species, the entire ped gene cluster (including *pedH*) is conserved in synteny ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=Open%20in%20a%20new%20tab)). Comparative genomics shows that *P. putida* KT2440’s PP_2664–PP_2680 region is structurally similar to the ped cluster in *P. putida* U and corresponds to the ethanol oxidation gene region in *P. aeruginosa* (controlled by ErbR) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=Open%20in%20a%20new%20tab)). This indicates a common evolutionary origin for these alcohol oxidation systems, with diversification (duplication of ADH genes and specialization for lanthanides) in certain lineages ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=P.%20putida%20U%20%20,88%20%28ExaC)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=Comparison%20of%20the%20gene%20cluster,actual%20size%20of%20this%20region)). The strong conservation between KT2440 and strain U (which differ in isolation source) implies that PedH’s function is ecologically important and under purifying selection. Outside the pseudomonads, analogous lanthanide-dependent PQQ dehydrogenases (sometimes called XoxF or ExaF in methylotrophs) share the critical Asp residue and thus are considered distant functional analogs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=match%20at%20L217%20%28Fig,of%20a%20variety%20of%20REMs)). In summary, PedH is highly conserved among *P. putida* strains and exists as part of a conserved phenylethanol utilization operon, and it is evolutionarily related to other quinoprotein ADHs like those in *P. aeruginosa* (ExaA) and methylotrophic bacteria (XoxF-type MDHs), reflecting a broader conserved mechanism of PQQ-dependent alcohol oxidation across proteobacteria ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=31,3)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=P.%20putida%20U%20%20,88%20%28ExaC)).

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
- **Arias et al. (2008)** – Identified and characterized the **ped gene cluster in *P. putida* U**, demonstrating two pathways (Ped for 2-phenylethanol, Pea for phenylethylamine) converging on phenylacetic acid. They showed PedH is one of two quinoprotein ADHs required for phenylethanol oxidation, working with PQQ and cytochrome c ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=conversion%20of%202,repeat%20protein%20and%20an%20ABC)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=efflux%20system,routes%20belonging%20to%20the%20phenylacetyl)). This foundational study defined the gene nomenclature (PedH, etc.) and the necessity of Pqq and Ccm accessory systems for cofactor biosynthesis and cytochrome c maturation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18177365/#:~:text=efflux%20system,routes%20belonging%20to%20the%20phenylacetyl)).  
- **Mückschel et al. (2012)** – Investigated **ethylene glycol metabolism in *P. putida***. They found that PedE and PedH are the periplasmic dehydrogenases initiating ethylene glycol oxidation in KT2440, despite KT2440’s slow growth on EG ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=acid,glyoxylic%20acid%20from%20ethylene%20glycol)). Comparative proteomics and mutagenesis confirmed PedH’s role and noted its high sequence identity with *P. putida* U PedH ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3502918/#:~:text=31,3)). This study highlighted the broad substrate range of PedE/PedH beyond aromatics.  
- **Wehrmann et al. (2017)** – Described the **functional role of lanthanides** for PedH in *P. putida* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=pyrroloquinoline%20quinone,also%20involved%20in%20the%20transcriptional)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=organism%20Pseudomonas%20putida%20KT2440,The%20present)). This mBio article provided the first biochemical characterization of PedH as a lanthanide-dependent enzyme. Key findings were that PedH is inactive without lanthanides but, with nanomolar La³⁺, shows high activity on various alcohols comparable or superior to PedE ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=organism%20Pseudomonas%20putida%20KT2440,little%20as%201%20to%2010%C2%A0nM)). They also discovered that PedH influences its own and *pedE* gene regulation, acting as part of a sensory system responding to lanthanides ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=Ce,KT2440%20to%20optimize%20growth%20with)).  
- **Wehrmann et al. (2018)** – Demonstrated the **“rare earth switch”** controlled by the PedS2/PedR2 system ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=The%20measured%20amounts%20of%20cell,response%20to%20different%20Ln%20elements)). Published in *mSphere*, this study showed that PedS2 is a lanthanide-sensing histidine kinase. In *P. putida* KT2440, lanthanum triggers PedR2 to upregulate *pedH* and concurrently repress *pedE*, an inverse regulatory relationship ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=The%20measured%20amounts%20of%20cell,response%20to%20different%20Ln%20elements)). A Δ*pedH* mutant was unable to grow on 2-phenylethanol with La³⁺ present ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6115532/#:~:text=As%20a%20consequence%20of%20the,overcome%20the%20repression%20of%20pedE)), confirming PedH’s essential role under those conditions. This work detailed the molecular mechanism of how bacteria switch between Ca-ADH and Ln-ADH.  
- **Wehrmann et al. (2019)** – Investigated the **ABC transporter PedA1A2BC and lanthanide uptake** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=uptake%20and%20its%20conversion%20to,Except%20for%20Er)). They found that an ABC transport system (PedA1A2BC, partly encoded in the ped cluster) is required for efficient internalization of lanthanides in *P. putida* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=uptake%20and%20its%20conversion%20to,Except%20for%20Er)). This facilitates PedH’s access to Ln³⁺ in the periplasm and links iron availability to lanthanide utilization, providing insight into how PedH obtains its metal cofactor in vivo.  
- **Recent Studies (2020–2023)** – Ongoing research (e.g., Bassan et al. 2023) examined *P. putida* KT2440’s response to different lanthanides (light vs heavy) and the fine-tuning of *pedH/pedE* expression ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=KT2440%20with%202,of%20pedE%20and%20pedH%20transcripts)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=The%20measured%20amounts%20of%20cell,response%20to%20different%20Ln%20elements)). These studies confirmed that light lanthanides optimally activate PedH, whereas heavy lanthanides cause mismetallation and regulatory perturbations ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=KT2440%20with%202,of%20pedE%20and%20pedH%20transcripts)). They further reinforced the model of PedH as part of an elaborate lanthanide-responsive metabolic network in pseudomonads.  

Overall, the gene **pedH** encodes a lanthanide-dependent PQQ enzyme that is central to *P. putida*’s ability to oxidize and grow on a variety of alcohols, especially aromatic alcohols like 2-phenylethanol. Its function, regulation by rare earth elements, and integration in aromatic catabolic pathways make PedH a compelling example of adaptive enzymatic innovation in environmental bacteria ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487730/#:~:text=lanthanum%2C%20a%20concentration%20assumed%20to,the%20availability%20of%20different%20lanthanides)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11520305/#:~:text=The%20measured%20amounts%20of%20cell,response%20to%20different%20Ln%20elements)). The detailed experimental evidence from genetic, biochemical, and regulatory studies underpins PedH’s annotation with Gene Ontology terms related to quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase activity, periplasmic localization, aromatic alcohol catabolism, and lanthanide-response, all of which are crucial for accurate Gene Ontology curation of this gene.
