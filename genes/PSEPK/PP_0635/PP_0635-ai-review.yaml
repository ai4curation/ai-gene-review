description: >
  PP_0635 encodes a bacterial reverse transcriptase (RT) belonging to the group II intron
  maturase family. The protein contains characteristic domains including Group_II_RT_mat
  (IPR030931), Mat_intron_G2 (IPR013597), and GrpII_Intron_Splice-Mob/Def (IPR051083).
  Based on genomic context analysis, the KT2440 genome harbors group II introns within
  genomic islands, and PP_0635 most plausibly functions as a group II intron-encoded
  RT/maturase involved in intron RNA folding, splicing, and retrohoming/retrotransposition.
  There is no direct evidence that this protein functions as a retron RT or participates
  in phage defense; the group II intron context is more likely based on domain architecture
  and genomic organization.

  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation is inferred from InterPro domain mapping. Group II intron maturases
      are known to bind their cognate intron RNA to promote correct folding and splicing.
      The domain architecture (Group_II_RT_mat, Mat_intron_G2) is consistent with RNA
      binding activity as part of the maturase function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      Group II intron RT/maturases bind specifically to their intron RNA as part of
      ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assembly. This binding is essential for maturase activity
      (promoting intron folding and splicing) and for retrohoming/retrotransposition.
      The annotation is appropriately broad and supported by the domain architecture.

  review:
    summary: >
      This is the core enzymatic activity of reverse transcriptases. PP_0635 is annotated
      with EC:2.7.7.49 (RNA-directed DNA polymerase) and contains the RT domain (IPR000477,
      PROSITE PS50878). This activity is fundamental to group II intron RT/maturases
      for retrohoming.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      The RT domain is clearly present (residues 100-326 per UniProt feature annotation)
      and the protein belongs to the bacterial reverse transcriptase family. RNA-directed
      DNA polymerase activity is the defining enzymatic function of group II intron
      maturases, used during retrohoming/retrotransposition to copy the intron RNA
      into DNA. [Weinel et al. 2002: "KT2440 genome harbors group II introns";

  review:
    summary: >
      This biological process annotation corresponds to the RNA-directed DNA polymerase
      activity of the RT. For group II intron maturases, this process is part of
      retrohoming/retrotransposition where the intron RNA is reverse transcribed
      into DNA for integration at a new genomic site.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >
      While the annotation is not incorrect (the protein does perform RNA-templated
      DNA biosynthesis), a more specific term would better capture the biological
      context. The RT activity in group II intron maturases specifically functions
      in retrotransposition/retrohoming of the intron element. GO:0032197 (retrotransposition)
      or GO:0006315 (homing of group II introns) would be more informative.

  review:
    summary: >
      This is a very high-level parent term of the more specific RNA-directed DNA
      polymerase activity. While technically correct (RT is a nucleotidyltransferase,
      which is a transferase), this annotation provides minimal information beyond
      what is already captured by the more specific GO:0003964.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >
      The annotation is redundant given the presence of the more specific GO:0003964
      (RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity). High-level terms like "transferase
      activity" provide little functional insight when more specific terms are
      already annotated. This is an artifact of automated keyword-based annotation.

      Reverse transcriptases require divalent metal ions (typically Mg2+) for

      and "Metal-binding". This is a standard requirement for polymerase activity.
    action: ACCEPT

  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation is problematic. It was inferred from the UniProt keyword
      "Antiviral defense" which was itself automatically assigned. While some
      bacterial RTs DO function in phage defense (retrons, Abi systems, CRISPR-RT),
      PP_0635 has domain architecture characteristic of group II intron maturases,
      NOT defense-associated RTs. The deep research explicitly states there is
      no evidence this protein participates in defense.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >
      The annotation represents a likely over-annotation based on an overly broad
      automated rule. Key evidence against a defense function:
      1) Domain architecture (Group_II_RT_mat, Mat_intron_G2) is characteristic
         of group II intron maturases, not retron or Abi defense RTs
      2) The KT2440 genome context shows group II introns in genomic islands,
         consistent with mobile genetic element function rather than defense
      3) Recent literature (Gapinska 2024) explicitly distinguishes defense RTs
         (Abi/retrons) from group II intron maturases by domain architecture
         and biological role
      4) No retron ncRNA or effector locus has been identified near PP_0635
      5) Deep research concluded: "There is no direct evidence that PP_0635 is
         a retron RT or participates in a retron defense module"

      genomic islands known to contain group II introns in KT2440. The RT
      activity is used for retrohoming - reverse transcription of the intron
      RNA followed by integration at a new site.

      The maturase domain (Mat_intron_G2 IPR013597, Group_II_RT_mat IPR030931)

      intron RNA and promoting correct folding for the autocatalytic splicing
      reaction. This is a core function distinct from the RT activity.
