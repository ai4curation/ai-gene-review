## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88CQ3
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Ribosomal RNA large subunit methyltransferase I {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70692.1}; EC=2.1.1.- {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70692.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=rlmI {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70692.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_5127 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70692.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the methyltransferase superfamily. RlmI family.
- **Key Domains:** PUA-like_sf. (IPR015947); PUA_sf. (IPR036974); RlmI-like_PUA. (IPR041532); SAM-dep_methyl-trfase. (IPR019614); SAM-dependent_MTases_sf. (IPR029063)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "rlmI" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'rlmI' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **rlmI** (gene ID: rlmI, UniProt: Q88CQ3) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

### [3] The USDA-ARS Ag100Pest Initiative: High-Quality Genome Assemblies for Agricultural Pest Arthropod Research

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

- Summary: CRONOS, a cross-reference server that contains entries from five mammalian organisms presented by major gene and protein information resources, is developed, which shows that the cross-references are highly accurate.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.750)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > gene_input Mandatory fields are 'gene_name', 'uniprot', 'hgnc_symbol' and 'ensembl'. This file is critical for establishing the link between the scRNA-seq data and the interaction pairs stored at the protein level. It includes the following gene and protein identifiers: (i) gene name ('gene_name'), (ii) UniProt identifier ('uniprot'), (iii) HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbol ('hgnc_symbol') and (iv) gene Ensembl identifier (ENSG) ('ensembl'). To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > The ultimate goal of the functional annotation process (Figure 4) is to assign biologically relevant information to predicted polypeptides, and to the features they derive from (e.g. gene, mRNA). This process is especially relevant nowadays in the context of the NGS era due to the capacity of sequencing, assembling, and annotating full genomes in short periods of time, e.g. less than a month. Functional elements could range from putative name and/or symbols for protein-coding genes, e.g. ADH to its putative biological function, e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase, associated gene ontology terms, e.g. GO:0004022, functional sites, e.g. METAL 47 47 Zinc 1, and domains, e.g. IPR002328, among other features. The function of predicted proteins can be computationally inferred based on the similarity between the sequence of interest and other sequences in different public repositories, e.g. BLASTP against Uniprot. Caution should be taken when assigning results merely based on sequence similarity as two evolutionary independent sequences which share some common domains could be considered homologs 62 . Thus, whenever possible, it is better to use orthologous sequences for annotation purposes rather than simply similar sequences 63 . With the growing number of sequences in those public repositories, it is possible to perform various searches and combine obtained results into a consensus annotation. The accurate assignment of the functional elements is a complex process, and the best annotation will involve manual curation.
    > There are two main outcomes of the functional annotation process. The first is the assignment of functional elements to genes. Downstream analysis of these elements allow further understanding of specific genome properties, e.g. metabolic pathways, and similarities compared with closely related species. The second result of the functional annotation is the additional quality check for the predicted gene set. It is possible to identify problematic and/or suspicious genes by the presence of specific domains, suspicious orthology assignment and/or absence of other functional elements, e.g. functional completeness.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > In addition to gene prediction models, evidence from orthologous protein sequences and transcriptome assembly could be used to improve annotation quality. Protein sequences of orthologous genes can be obtained from UniProt (The UniProt, 2017). Ones from Swiss-Port have been reviewed and thus are of higher quality. Transcriptome assembly may be available from previous studies or can be assembled de novo from RNA-seq reads by Trinity (Haas et al., 2013). High quality transcriptome assembly can be selected as described in (Zhang et al., 2021). Note: Details about gene structure annotation (Holt and Yandell, 2011) can be found at http:// gmod.org/wiki/MAKER_Tutorial, https://darencard.net/blog/2017-05-16-maker-genomeannotation/, and the protocol (Campbell et al., 2014).
    > b. Quality measurement and functional annotation.
    > For each predicted gene, Maker2 provides the annotation edit distance (AED) score, which measures the goodness of fit between its predicted gene structure and its evidence support. The lower the score, the more accurate the prediction. If more than 90% genes with AED scores lower than 0.5, the genome can be considered well annotated. In addition to the AED score, a high proportion of recognizable domains contained in predicted protein -e.g., higher than 50% -also indicates a good annotation. Recognizable protein domains can by scanned by InterProScan (Jones et al., 2014), assigning potential function to predicted genes.
    > Note: Besides the aforementioned quality measurement, we strongly recommend measuring the completeness of the genome assembly and annotation by checking the existence of a set of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) (Simao et al., 2015). A high-level completeness of genome assembly and annotation is imperative for a better identification of gene expansion. Based on the result of this analysis, researchers can decide whether they need to further improve the genome assembly before predicting gene expansion. A detailed protocol of BUSCO is available at

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.719)
    > For S. cerevisiae, we used the extra gene feature of SCOPE and identified 12 previously unreported genes containing RBA modules (8 with RRPE-PAC and 4 with PAC-RRPE). By utilizing functional annotation and microarray expression data (see Materials and Methods), we were able to find evidence from at least one other source for 8 genes and from two sources for 4 genes. Based on these analyses, we can hypothesize about several new candidates for a role in ribosome biogenesis in S. cerevisiae.
    > The 4 candidate genes that are most likely involved in RBA (supported as such by SCOPE motif and module data, SGD functional description information and SPELL expression data) are as follows. YDR465C is an arginine methyltransferase that methylates ribosomal protein RPL12. YGR272C is an essential protein required for maturation of 18S rRNA. YPR010C is the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase I. YNL061W is a probable RNA methyltransferase essential for large ribosomal subunit biogenesis. Table 5 describes which genes are supported by which analyses and Table S4 contains more information about all 12 predicted genes.

    > To obtain basic information on WERs and their target genes, such as official gene symbols, gene IDs, gene types, and genomic locations, gene annotations were downloaded from the GENCODE project [ 44 ] for human and mouse, and from NCBI [ 45 ] and Ensembl [ 46 ] for the other species. Genomic locations were extracted from the corresponding GTF annotation files. Gene symbols were primarily standardized based on the NCBI Gene database [ 45 ] for mRNAs and lncRNAs, GtR-NAdb [ 47 ] for tRNAs, miRbase [ 48 ] for microRNAs, and cir-cBase [ 49 ] for circRNAs. Deprecated or substituted versions of genes were filtered out. The LiftOver [ 50 ] program was employed to convert and unify genomic coordinates across different genome assembly versions.
    > The functional descriptions of WERs were compiled based on the UniProt database [ 51 ] and further supplemented with evidence from relevant publications, with particular emphasis on their functions as RNA modification regulatory proteins.

    > It is well known that protein names are highly ambiguous [45,46]. Researchers working in specific subcommunities tend to develop their own nomenclature, resulting in multiple names for the same protein. Acronyms and abbreviations further complicate the picture. Simply being able to recognize a protein name as such is just a starting point. The name needs then to be unambiguously qualified, by referring to an entry in a standard protein database, such as UniProt http:// www.expasy.org/sprot/ [47].
    > In order for that to happen, the disambiguation must occur at two levels: interspecies (to which specific organisms does the protein mention refer?) and intraspecies (within a given organism, which specific protein is meant?). For example, a protein mentioned in text as eIF4E could refer to a large number of different proteins. A search in the Swiss-Prot section of UniProt (the manually curated section) delivers 46 possible matches. However, if the term appears contextually with the mention of a specific organism, like in the sentence 'The Cap-binding protein eIF4E promotes folding of a functional domain of yeast translation initiation factor eIF4G1' (PubMed: 10409688), then it is reasonable to assume that the name refers to a specific organism (yeast), thus restricting the possible matches in UniProt to the following two: EAP1_YEAST (eIF4E-associated protein 1) and IF4E_YEAST (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E). For the task of protein annotation, we have adopted a high-recall, low-precision term annotation approach, followed by very strict disambiguation steps, which gradually increase precision (at some expense for recall).
    > UniProt contains for each protein a list of frequently used synonyms, as well as the name and synonyms of its encoding gene. We have built a database that maps the synonyms to the protein identifier. We have further enriched such a list using morpho-syntactic rules that generate variants of the synonyms. Starting from the subset of UniProt delivered by the BioCreative organizers (which contained 228,

    > Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the scientific community to sequence a large number of genomes. Currently there are 1,390 complete genomes [1] annotated in the KEGG genome repository and many more are in progress. However, experimental functional characterization of these genes cannot match the data production rate. Adding to this, more than 50% of functional annotations are enigmatic [2]. Even the well studied genomes, such as E. coli and C. elegans, have 51.17% and 87.92% ambiguous annotations (putative, probable and unknown) respectively [2]. To fill the gap between the number of sequences and their (quality) annotations, we need fast, yet accurate automated functional annotation methods. Such computational annotation methods are also critical in analyzing, interpreting and characterizing large complex data sets from high-throughput experimental methods, such as protein-protein interactions (PPI) [3] and gene expression data by clustering similar genes and proteins.
    > The definition of biological function itself is enigmatic in biology and highly context dependent [4][5][6]. This is part of the reason why more than 50% of functional annotations are ambiguous. The functional scope of a protein in an organism differs depending on the aspects under consideration. Proteins can be annotated based on their mode of action, i.e. Enzyme Commission (EC) number [7] (physiological aspect) or their association with a disease (phenotypic aspect). The lack of functional coherence increases the complexity of automated functional annotation. Another major barrier is the use of different vocabulary by different annotations. A function can be described differently in different organisms [8]. This problem can be solved by using ontologies, which serve as universal functional definitions. Enzyme Commission (E.C) [9], MIPS Functional Catalogue (FunCat) [10] and Gene Ontology (GO) [11] are such ontologies. With GO being the most recently and widely used, many automated annotation methods use GO for functional annotation.
    > Protein function assignment methods can be divided into two main categories -structure-based methods and sequence-based methods. A protein's function is highly related to its structure. Protein

    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

Given the low amount of functional (GO) annotation in our largest assembly, C. shasta þ NHP (see Results), we used BlastX to search for homologs of genes of interest in two custom concatenated databases that comprised the Cell Migration Knowledge Database (CMKB) which includes proteins, families, and complexes involved in cell migration (http://www.cellmigration. org/index.shtml, last accessed February 5, 2015; $7,600 protein sequences), and the MEROPS database, which consists of a nr library of full-length sequences of peptidases and peptidase inhibitors (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/, last accessed December 2, 2014; $450,000 sequences; Rawlings et al. 2016). We searched using the longest representatives for each gene in the C. shasta þ NHP assembly (23,418 contigs; IIR-RBT6) then parsed matches (bit score > 100) and posteriorly classified homologs to proteases or motility genes matching the specific databases. We then selected only genes with the same annotation in UniProt (determined using the same standards: no ambiguous terms filtering, bit score > 100) to confirm gene identity. Due to disagreements between annotations (CMKB vs. UniProt, and MEROPS vs. UniProt), we curated gene lists manually, removing genes that matched one or more of the following criteria: 1) no genetic distances available (only available for reference); 2) disagreements between annotations from the different databases, after checking for synonyms or function similarity; 3) annotations that contained terms from UniProt "Uncharacterized protein" and "Predicted protein" (ambiguous terms), and whose identity could not be confirmed; and 4) annotations that contained nonspecific terms, such as "heat shock protein" or "ribosomal protein."

    > As previously described (Triant et al. 2020), once a proteincoding gene annotation is complete, each new or modified isoform should be compared to a well-curated protein sequence database to check for congruency with known proteins. The sequence of an annotation is obtained by right clicking it and selecting Get Sequence. The first choice of database to search is the well-curated UniProtKB/Swissprot database using BLAST at either the UniProt (https:// www. unipr ot. org/ blast) or NCBI website (https:// blast. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ Blast. cgi) (Sayers et al. 2023a;UniProt Consortium 2023). If there is no match with a significant e-value (< 1e−05) in UniProtKB/Swissprot, the next database to try is the Model Organisms (landmark) database at NCBI. If that fails, select the RefSeq Proteins database and exclude your organism of interest from the search. Although RefSeq includes computationally predicted and hypothetical proteins, an alignment to a homologous protein from another organism provides support for the annotation. An alignment that covers the full length of both the annotated protein and the database protein sequence suggests the annotation is correct. An alignment that encompasses the full length of an annotated protein sequence but only part of a database protein suggests that the annotation is truncated. You may be able to correct the annotation with additional evidence, but if there is not sufficient evidence the issue can be noted in the Annotation Information Panel under the Comment tab. A partial alignment of an annotated protein to a database protein suggests the annotation has a reading frame shift or was extended incorrectly. Aligning the coding sequence (CDS) to the protein database will reveal whether the problem is due to a reading frame shift. Further annotation editing should be performed to correct the reading frame. If an incorrect extension was due to the merging of two genes, you should edit or redo the annotation. Any unresolved issues should be entered in the Comment section of the Annotation Information Panel.

Cluster representatives were aligned against UniProt/Swiss-Prot (release 2024_01) using DIAMOND v2.0.15 in sensitive mode (--sensitive). The initial alignment yielded 62,689 ORFs with putative UniProt matches. For each match, protein names, functional descriptions, and Gene Ontology (GO) terms were extracted for downstream label assignment.

    > iological and biomedical research relies on complete accurate and consistent annotation of genes and their products. However, identifying and annotating functional elements in the human genome is a persistent challenge. Despite intensive study, especially in identifying protein-coding genes, our understanding of the genome is far from complete, particularly with regard to non-coding RNAs, alternatively spliced transcripts and regulatory sequences. The GENCODE consortium is carrying out the annotation of all gene features in the reference human genome 1 . The annotation combines computational analysis, targeted experimental evidence and manual curation approaches to produce high-accuracy genome annotations for protein-coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) and pseudogenes. The reference gene set produced by GENCODE is the default gene set available in Ensembl.
    > A key goal of genome annotation is to describe a complete list of protein-coding genes. For many genes, confirmation of coding potential and the definition of the exact gene structure are not trivial 2 . Automated algorithms utilize comparative genomics methods such as phyloCSF 3 to score transcript-coding potential while annotation groups incorporate antibody tagging 4 and mass spectrometry [5][6][7] proteogenomic experiments. GENCODE release (V22) contains only 19,814 protein-coding genes, decreasing from over 20,600 protein-coding loci in release V7. This fundamental refinement can mainly be attributed to improved comparative and proteomics analysis methods that have indicated transcripts with poor coding potential for removal from the reference gene set. 8 igh-quality peptides from large-scale proteomics experiments confirm coding potential, especially for genes and transcripts where there is little other supporting evidence 9,10 . Proteomics experiments only identify a fraction of detectable peptides. A peptide may not be detected if it is not amenable to the methods used or if the corresponding protein is not expressed in detectable quantities in the tissue type analysed. This means that while reliably identified peptides verify protein-coding potential, the lack of corresponding peptides does not prove a transcript is not translated.
