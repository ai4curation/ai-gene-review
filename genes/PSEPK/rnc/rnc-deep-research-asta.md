## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88MY5
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Ribonuclease 3 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00104}; EC=3.1.26.3 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00104}; AltName: Full=Ribonuclease III {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00104}; Short=RNase III {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00104};
- **Gene Information:** Name=rnc {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00104}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_1433;
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ribonuclease III family. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-
- **Key Domains:** dsRBD_dom. (IPR014720); RNase_III. (IPR011907); RNase_III_dom. (IPR000999); RNase_III_sf. (IPR036389); dsrm (PF00035)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "rnc" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'rnc' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **rnc** (gene ID: rnc, UniProt: Q88MY5) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

We divided the UniProt and the Gene Ontology annotations (GOA) into tier 1 (more reliable) and tier 2 (less reliable) annotations, depending on the attached evidence codes. For UniProt, annotations with the evidence codes ECO:0000269 or ECO:0000305 are considered as tier 1, while annotations with evidence codes ECO:0000250, ECO:0000255, or ECO:0000303 are tier 2. For Gene Ontology, annotations with evidence codes IDA, IMP, IPI, IGI, EXP, IBA, IKR, TAS, NAS, IC, or ND are tier 1, while annotations with evidence codes HDA, ISS, ISA, RCA, ISO, ISM, IGC, or IEA are tier 2. Based on these, each protein was assigned exactly one broad localization. It was considered to be a transmembrane protein (TMP), if it is assigned the 'integral component of membrane (GO:0016021)' GO term in tier 1 GOA annotations, or it is annotated as a TMP in HTP with a confidence score over 85, or is annotated in HTP as a TMP with a confidence score above 50 and is also annotated as a TMP in GOA (either tier).

The NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) are the nucleotide sequence database that includes nucleotide sequence from GenBank of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as cell, organism and ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. KEGG is an established Cluster of Orthologous (KO) annotation system that can accomplish the function annotation of the genome/transcriptome of a newly sequenced species. SwissProt is a manual annotated and reviewed protein sequence database that has a high-quality protein sequence database from experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions. Pfam is comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile of hidden Markov models. Many proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of a specific structural domain possesses a certain degree of conservative property. GO is the established standard for the functional annotation of gene products and controlled vocabulary used to classify the functional attributes of gene products of a biological process, a molecular function and a cellular component.

Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > Whole-genome sequencing has enabled investigations into the gene content of living many organisms and forms the foundation for further study of gene expression, proteomics and epigenetics. After assembly of a novel genome, gene annotation is often the first step in analysing the gene content of an organism. Accurate annotation of the exonic structure of genes is crucial to the success of all subsequent functional and comparative analyses.
    > Problems that can potentially be caused by incorrect gene annotation are numerous and can lead to incorrect assessments of the lifestyle and ecology of an organism. In comparative genomics where orthologous genes or conserved functional domains are compared between species/isolates, the estimated numbers of such genes/ domains can be distorted by less than perfect annotations (as described by Hane et al. [1], S Text 1). Prediction of extracellular secretion, which can be determined by a short signal peptide at the N-terminus, can miss secreted proteins if the start codon of a gene has been incorrectly annotated. Mis-annotating the start of protein translation could either cut off the signal peptide or bury it within the annotation. While a seemingly benign annotation error, the consequences for downstream research could be detrimental, particularly as the biotic interactions or industrial applications of microbes are largely determined by their secretomes. Additionally, translated protein sequences of novel species are often submitted to databases such as NCBI [2] and Uniprot [3]. It is commonplace to use these database entries to support the annotation of related species or isolates, meaning errors present in the pioneer annotation may be repeated. When these new annotations based on false assumptions are added to databases, there is not only a propagation of errors, but also a perceived strengthening of homology evidence for incorrect protein sequences.
    > In recent years, correction of in silico predicted gene annotations with RNA-seq derived transcripts and read alignments has enabled vastly improved genome annotations and corrections of annotated gene structures [4][5][6].

    > Given a set of predicted protein-coding genes for a newly sequenced genome, functional annotation involves assigning putative functions to the predicted genes. Two ways in which this can be done are assigning protein names and Gene Ontology (GO;Gene Ontology Consortium, 2010) terms to the predicted proteins. Here we describe a computational pipeline for assigning protein names and GO terms to predicted proteins in parasitic worm (nematode and platyhelminth) genomes, which transfers names and GO terms from orthologues in other species.
    > When assigning protein names, UniProt protein naming rules (www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot) are followed where possible. This recommends that a good and stable name for a protein is "as neutral as possible"; that a protein name "should be, as far as possible, unique and attributed to all orthologs"; and a protein name "should not contain a specific characteristic of the protein, and in particular it should not reflect the function or role of the protein, nor its subcellular location, its domain structure, its tissue specificity, its molecular weight or its species of origin".
    > In our protocol, a protein name is assigned to each predicted protein based on curated names in UniProt (Bairoch & Apweiler, 2000) for human, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schistosoma mansoni orthologues identified from a database of gene families (e.g. built using Ensembl Compara; Vilella et al. 2009), or (if no information is found from orthologues) based on InterPro (Hunter et al. 2012) domains. Figure 1 shows an example of using our protein naming pipeline for four Strongyloides ratti genes that belong to the tubulin polyglutamylase family (underlined in pink), where four different protein names were assigned to them (in pink), based on names of their C. elegans or human orthologues.
    > Since each of the S. ratti genes belonged to a different subfamily of the tubulin polyglutamylase family, they were assigned different names.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.

Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.

- Summary: It is demonstrated that sequencing of large numbers of full-length transcripts followed by computational mapping greatly improves identification of the complete exon structures of eukaryotic genes.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.657)
    > The scientific community has recently witnessed the publication of several large eukaryotic genomes in various stages of completion, including the human genome [1,2], the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [3], the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster [4], and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana [5,6]. Each of these genomes contains over 10,000 genes, and as scientists attempt to study these genes more closely, the need for accurate gene models becomes increasingly apparent. For high-throughput genome sequencing projects, equally rapid high-throughput genome annotation is necessary, and bioinformaticists use a variety of computational methods to generate this annotation. Despite many improvements in recent years, these computational methods still fall short of producing correct models for every gene. In order to improve the annotation and facilitate further research, it is essential that we develop methods to identify genes correctly.
    > Annotation of a gene model should include a precise description of where the genomic DNA sequence is transcribed into messenger RNA, the positions in the mRNA of any and all introns, and the translated protein sequence of the gene. If alternative splice variants are present, these should be annotated as well. Computational methods for genome annotation have several shortcomings that result in the following errors in annotation.
    > Gene prediction programs predict exon boundaries correctly only about 80% of the time, even for the most intensively studied organisms [7][8][9]. Thus a gene with five exons will be completely correct only 0.8 5 = 33% of the time, and genes with more exons will be even less likely to be correct. Gene prediction programs also tend to merge and split gene models. Thus two real genes may be merged into one predicted transcript, or vice versa. In addition, programs to align genomic DNA to protein sequences often miss small exons, especially when the homologous proteins are not well conserved. Annotation protocols also tend to miss short genes.

    > The BLASTx homology search tool, a component of the standalone NCBI-blast-2.3.0+, was used to perform functional annotation of the F. udum genes (Altschul et al., 1990). With a cut-off E value of ≤1e−06 and a similarity of 34%, BLASTx identified the homologous sequences of the genes in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using Blast2GO PRO 4.1.5 (Conesa and Gotz, 2008). In three different mappings, B2G performed as follows: (1) Using two NCBI-provided mapping files, blast result accessions are used to get gene names (symbols; gene info, gene 2 accessions). (2) Blast result GI identifiers were used to retrieve UniProt IDs using a mapping file from PIR (non-redundant reference protein database), which includes PSD, Swiss-Prot, UniProt, TrEMBL, GenPept, RefSeq, and PDB. The names of the identified genes were searched in the species-specific entries of the gene product table of the GO database. With the aid of the KAAS-KEGG Automatic Annotation Server, pathway analyses were carried out. This database provides functional annotation of genes using other data servers (Moriya et al., 2007). Accessions from the blast results were looked for in the DBXRef table of the GO database.

    > In a basic workflow, the GOnet application receives a list of gene symbols, protein symbols, or protein IDs (UniProt IDs) as an input, and outputs a graph (an example given in Fig. 1). There are various input parameters which will affect the actual structure of the graph visualized and its appearance. The first main user choice is which GO terms the genes are annotated against:
    > 1. GO terms statistically significantly over-represented in the gene list submitted. 2. A predefined subset (also known as 'GO slim'), or a user-supplied list of terms.
    > In the first case the analysis will be referred to as an 'enrichment' analysis, in the second as an 'annotation' analysis.
    > Input parameters 1) Gene list. A mandatory input parameter containing the genes/proteins of interest. Currently human and mouse data is supported. An example of a human gene list might look like this:
    > Fig. 1 Sample network output generated by GOnet application. Gene differentially expressed in CD4 Bulk Memory T cells in Latent TB patients compared to healthy controls were used as an example [22] The gene list can also be accompanied with a contrast value. For example, This contrast value can be any decimal number, such as the log-fold change of gene expression between two conditions. This is merely a visualization enhancement. If the value is supplied it can be used later to differentially color specific genes in the graph (note different colors of gene nodes in Fig. 1), and visually indicate up-or down-regulation of specific genes and gene clusters.
    > The application can process common gene symbols (like in the example above), UniProt IDs, and MGI Accession IDs (mouse only). The former type of ID (gene symbols), although is the most human friendly, can unfortunately be ambiguous. For example, AIM1 can mean 'absent in melanoma' (also called CRYBG1) or 'Aurora and Ipl1-like midbody-associated protein' (also known as AURKB). Due to this ambiguity UniProt IDs or MGI accession IDs (for mouse) are preferred.
    > 2) GO namespace. Can be any of 'biological process', 'molecular function' or 'cellular component'.
