## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88JP8
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Transcriptional regulator, IclR family {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68209.1};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_2601 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68209.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** GAF-like_dom_sf. (IPR029016); HTH_MetabolicPath_Reg. (IPR050707); Tscrpt_reg_IclR_C. (IPR014757); Tscrpt_reg_IclR_N. (IPR005471); WH-like_DNA-bd_sf. (IPR036388)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_2601" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_2601' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_2601** (gene ID: PP_2601, UniProt: Q88JP8) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > The protein sequences were functionally annotated by combining information retrieved from the UniProt database ( [25], accessed on 9 June 2022) and one-to-one fast orthology assignments using the eggNOG-mapper v.2.1.7 tool ( [26], accessed on 9 June 2022), as described in [27]. Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Given a set of predicted protein-coding genes for a newly sequenced genome, functional annotation involves assigning putative functions to the predicted genes. Two ways in which this can be done are assigning protein names and Gene Ontology (GO;Gene Ontology Consortium, 2010) terms to the predicted proteins. Here we describe a computational pipeline for assigning protein names and GO terms to predicted proteins in parasitic worm (nematode and platyhelminth) genomes, which transfers names and GO terms from orthologues in other species.
    > When assigning protein names, UniProt protein naming rules (www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot) are followed where possible. This recommends that a good and stable name for a protein is "as neutral as possible"; that a protein name "should be, as far as possible, unique and attributed to all orthologs"; and a protein name "should not contain a specific characteristic of the protein, and in particular it should not reflect the function or role of the protein, nor its subcellular location, its domain structure, its tissue specificity, its molecular weight or its species of origin".
    > In our protocol, a protein name is assigned to each predicted protein based on curated names in UniProt (Bairoch & Apweiler, 2000) for human, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schistosoma mansoni orthologues identified from a database of gene families (e.g. built using Ensembl Compara; Vilella et al. 2009), or (if no information is found from orthologues) based on InterPro (Hunter et al. 2012) domains. Figure 1 shows an example of using our protein naming pipeline for four Strongyloides ratti genes that belong to the tubulin polyglutamylase family (underlined in pink), where four different protein names were assigned to them (in pink), based on names of their C. elegans or human orthologues.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

Biomedical concepts Gene/Protein: Annotations could be specific gene/protein names or classes/family names of gene/proteins. In particular, very broad concepts like "protein", "gene", "enzyme", "receptors", "kinase", "cytokine", "transcription regulators/factors" are out of the scope of annotations. However, family/subtype names of those concepts are considered for the annotations, such as "amylolytic enzyme", "antioxidant enzyme", "map kinase p38", because these terms narrow the concepts to specific families of gene/protein, enzyme.

    > Genes overrepresented for nonsynonymous and structural mutations were classified into functional groups based on the functional annotation table constructed with DAVID v.2023q3 91,92 (Table S4). We established the following rules for generalizing genes into functional groups: Chaperone: genes that encode proteins that perform chaperone or chaperonin-like activities (Uniprot Keyword: KW-0143); Envelope: Genes that encode proteins involved in the maintenance of the cell-envelope such as phospholipid biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0008654) and peptidoglycan biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0000270); Metabolism: Genes that encode proteins involved in general metabolic functions, such as purine metabolism (KEGG: eco00230), amino acid metabolism (KEGG: eco00470, eco00330); or TCA Cycle (KEGG: eco00020); Regulators: Genes that encode proteins directly involved in transcription (GO-BP: 0031564; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0804), translation (GO-BP:0006412, GO-BP:0006413; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0689), or the regulation of transcription (GO-BP: 0006355, GO-BP:2000143, GO-BP:0006353, GO-BP: GO:0045893; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0805); and Transport: Genes that encode proteins involved in transport: such as ABC transporters (Interpro: PR017871), MFS transporters (Interpro: IPR011701); symporters (Interpro: IPR023954, IPR001204, IPR001734, IPR023025, IPR004840), or Antiporters (Interpro: IPR004771).

    > Further the assembled transcript contigs were validated using CLC Genomics workbench (CLC Bio, Boston, MA 02108 USA) by mapping high quality reads back to the assembled transcript contigs. ORF-Predictor [57], an online tool, was used on default parameters to identify the coding DNA sequences (CDS) from assembled transcript contigs. GC counts of transcripts was determined using a custom-made perl script.
    > Functional annotations. The functional annotation was performed by aligning coding DNA sequence (CDS) to NCBI 'green plant database (txid 33090)' database using basic local alignment search tool (BLASTX) [58] with an E-value threshold of 1e -06 and GO assignments were used to classify the functions of the predicted CDS. The GO mapping also provided ontology of defined terms representing gene product properties which were grouped into three main domains: biological process (BP), molecular function (MF) and cellular component (CC). GO mapping was carried out in order to retrieve GO terms for all the BLASTX functionally annotated CDS. The GO mapping used defined criteria to retrieve GO terms for annotated CDS which included use of BLASTX result accession IDs to retrieve gene names or symbols, UniProt IDs and direct search in the dbxref table of GO database. Identified gene names or symbols were then searched in the species specific entries of the gene-product tables of GO database. UniProt IDs made use of protein information resource (PIR) which includes protein sequence database (PSD), UniProt, SwissProt, TrEMBL, RefSeq, GenPept, and PDB databases. Gene Ontology analysis helps in specifying all the annotated nodes comprising of GO functional groups. CDS were compared against the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) database for the analysis of phylogenetically widespread domain families. CDS were compared against Pfam database for higher-level groupings of related protein families, known as clans and the identification of domains that occurs within proteins. BLASTX was used against uniprot-swissprot database with cut-off e-value 1e-6 to annotate predicted CDS against protein.

    > Of the 19,984 protein-coding genes in C. elegans, 10,838 have a name/gene symbol (e.g. lin-12). Gene naming is largely investigator-initiated, with a request to WormBase through genenames@wormbase.org ; this will continue with C. elegans content in the Alliance. The gene symbol, which is formatted in lowercase and italics, communicates information about the gene based on mutant phenotype, functional criteria, orthology, or homology. To make genes easily recognizable to non-elegans researchers, the current preference is to name genes with human orthologs after the human gene if characterized. Gene name stability and formatting are important to avoid confusion in the literature and to facilitate searches of other databases that use the C. elegans gene symbols (e.g. UniProt) and text mining. However, occasionally names have been changed because of incorrect orthology or not supported by functional studies from the community. Names have also been changed based on requests from multiple community members (e.g. daf-21 renamed as hsp-90). To avoid name changes and to have the published name used in databases, researchers should contact WormBase prior to manuscript submission; the most common issue is that the requested name is already in use in C. elegans or another model organism for a nonhomologous gene product. Over the past 10 years, the community has averaged 180 new gene names per year, often with a corresponding publication, increasing knowledge about our favorite organism. More information about C. elegans-specific nomenclature can be found at https://wormbase.org/about/ userguide/nomenclature.

    > This is the final step of the workflow. Its goal is to annotate with additional information the genes identified in previous stages, helping to elucidate their possible behavior and role in the response to the treatment under study. A crucial step is to identify the differentially expressed genes in the set I. That is, to select the genes in I that have an absolute value of the Log Fold Change of at least 2 (| ij | ≥ 2) for at least one sample. This corresponds to genes whose expression level is quadrupled (up or down) from the control to treatment condition; they are the target genes.
    > Furthermore, functional category enrichment can be carried out by, e.g., searching for gene ontology annotations in databases such as QuickGO [5], UniProt [10], and the Rice Genome Annotation Project [21]. Such annotations can provide evidence of biological implications of the target genes in the treatment-tolerance mechanisms. Furthermore, those databases can be used to identify the protein products of genes, which can be used in turn to provide new insights on how target genes are involved in functional pathways related to treatment. Such analysis includes a review of reported protein-protein interactions in databases such as STRING [41]. The protein interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations. They stem from computational prediction, knowledge transfer between organisms, and interactions aggregated from other (primary) databases. The search for unknown interactions would extend the workflow with additional steps.

    > Scientists can find querying datasets useful to identify expression levels between disease and normal pairs to discover differential expression for a gene. They may also want to research on potential biomarkers or pathways that lead to tumor formation or want to explore the overall expression of specific genes across multiple cancer types. Users can search BioXpress using HGNCapproved gene symbols (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee), UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot accessions or RefSeq accessions. Differentially expressed genes for a specific cancer type can also be retrieved. Additionally, all data in BioXpress, including lists of genes significantly differentially expressed in two or more cancer types, can be downloaded.
    > Searching using gene name (gene/protein-centric search)
    > A search using the HGNC-approved gene symbol or UniProt/RefSeq accession retrieves differential expression information (cancer vs. normal), tumor-only expression data (where normal samples are not available) and baseline expression information from normal human tissues (Illumina Human Body Map Project). The example below provides an overview of a gene/protein-centric search.
