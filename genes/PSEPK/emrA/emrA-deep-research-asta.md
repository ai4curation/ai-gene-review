## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88H16
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Multidrug efflux transport system-membrane fusion protein {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN69150.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=emrA {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN69150.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_3549 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN69150.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the membrane fusion protein (MFP) (TC 8.A.1)
- **Key Domains:** AaeA-lik-b-barrel. (IPR058634); EmrA/FarA_HH. (IPR058633); MFP. (IPR050739); Beta-barrel_AAEA (PF25963); HH_EMRA (PF25885)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "emrA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'emrA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **emrA** (gene ID: emrA, UniProt: Q88H16) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Could you also add a short explanation why you believe it should be classified as a cathepsin (what protein did you transfer this annotation from)?
    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Genes annotated as "hypothetical protein" in the reference genomes were evaluated to refine functional descriptions and to support ontology assignments used in the functional-category analyses. For each hypothetical protein gene, we queried ChlamBase to retrieve curated locus information, alternative gene names, and any community-or literature-derived annotations for the corresponding gene product (74). We also reviewed the corresponding UniProtKB entry to extract the current protein name, description, predicted features, and evidence context for functional annotations (75).
    > To incorporate experimentally supported information not captured in database summaries, we performed targeted PubMed searches using locus tags and commonly used aliases (e.g., CT_694, CTL_0360), as well as gene and protein name synonyms. When peer-reviewed studies provided direct experimental evidence (e.g., secretion via the type III secretion system, inclusion membrane localization, interaction partners, or phenotypes associated with targeted mutagenesis or knockdown), we used those findings to refine the functional description applied in this study

    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > Many public databases of gene information are available (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16). However, different public databases often use different sets of unique identifiers (IDs) to describe the same genes or homologous genes in different species. One challenge of comparing large-scale biological datasets is the unification of gene names; otherwise, researchers spend a lot of effort in converting gene IDs when searching different databases. Another is the likelihood of missing some databases due to unfamiliarity; this is particularly true for clinicians and researchers who are specialized in inner ear research but are not necessarily familiar with genomics and bioinformatics. One goal of the SHIELD is to integrate relevant gene annotation information from various public databases in one centralized location.
    > For the SHIELD, annotations were derived from public databases and literature. Currently implemented annotations include official gene symbols, description of the gene name and synonyms, human and mouse chromosome cytogenetic banding, RefSeq RNA and protein (for protein coding genes) accession numbers, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez gene ID, genomic coordinates in both mouse reference genome assemblies mm9 and mm10, Ensembl, the Vertebrate Genome Annotation Database (VEGA) Mouse Genome Informatics, UniProt, Online Mendalian Inheritance in Man and gene ontology.
    > For each protein coding genes, we display all UniProt protein isoforms for that gene, the length in amino acid residues and the predicted number of transmembrane domains (TMs). We predicted TMs by running TMHMM2.0 run on all UniProt protein isoforms of each gene (17). The number of TMs is of special interest for research in sensory function, because many key proteins involved in signaling-such as the mechanotransduction ion channels-are integral membrane proteins. This information would help identify candidate genes for the components of the mechanotransduction apparatus of the inner ear.
    > We also performed manual curation of inner ear disorders including syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss according to the Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org) and primary literature.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

- Summary: A comprehensive protein localization analysis of essential genes in 27 prokaryotes including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and 1 archaeon has been performed and shows that proteins encoded by essential genes are enriched in internal location sites, while exist in cell envelope with a lower proportion compared with non-essential ones.

    > Bioinformatics Databases. DEG is a database of essential genes (http://www. essentialgene.org/). The newly released DEG 10 has been developed to accommodate the quantitative and qualitative advancements brought by the progressive identification methods. Currently available records of both essential and nonessential genes among a wide range of organisms can be downloaded from DEG 10, making it possible to compare the two different types of genes in many aspects 21 .
    > 27 prokaryotic organisms including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and Methanococcus maripaludis S2, the only record of the Archaea domain were selected to analyze the protein localization and GO distribution of the essential and nonessential genes. There are 31 bacterial records corresponding to 27 organisms in the database in total and 26 sets of data were selected in the current study. Streptococcus pneumonia was not chosen for the lack of non-essential genes. Since the essential genes were not genome-widely identified, it's not reasonable to regard the complementary set of essential genes as non-essential genes in Streptococcus pneumonia 29,30 . In the case of multiple records for one organism, the one with the most convincing experimental methods was chosen. The non-essential genes in Methanococcus maripaludis S2 and 13 bacteria such as Escherichia coli MG1655 are obtained based on the original literatures, while non-essential genes in other 12 organisms such as Bacillus subtilis 168 are the complementary set of essential genes. The information of the organisms used in the current study are displayed in Table 1.
    > The three model genomes' subcellular location information and the Gene Ontology (GO) terms used for the analysis in the current study were downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt; http://www.uniprot.org). Maintained by the UniProt Consortium, UniProt is committed to providing biologists with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and functional annotation 27 . Among the wealth of annotation data, detailed GO annotation statements are included.

    > To assign the functional or gene categories, we integrated cancer genes, tumor suppressors, epigenetic regulators, DNA damage repair genes, human essential genes, kinases, and transcription factors. In each gene group, we checked the retention and ORFs of the main protein functional features. There are 13 features belonging to the 'region' category, including 'calcium binding', Figure 1. Overview of KinaseFusionDB and its role in understanding kinase fusion proteins. (a) I. The top section identifies therapeutic targets for oncogenic activation of kinases, including wild-type kinases activated by overexpression or genomic amplification, mutated kinases with gain-offunction mutations, and kinase fusion proteins resulting from chromosomal rearrangements. II. The middle section highlights the functionalities of KinaseFusionDB, such as providing functional annotations, mRNA/protein expression data, drug binding information, and relevant literature reviews. III. The third section addresses the current limitations in targeting kinase fusion proteins, particularly the lack of comprehensive 3D structures for these proteins. It emphasizes the partial knowledge of kinase fusion protein structures and the need for further drug screening. IV. The bottom section discusses how computational approaches, such as predicted 3D structures (e.g. from AlphaFold2), can fill these gaps, supporting drug screening and filtering based on consistent binding among multiple fusion protein isoforms. (b) Kinase domain-retained human kinase fusion proteins.

To perform the protein functional feature retention search, we first downloaded the GFF (General Feature Format) format protein information of 10 651 UniProt [26] accessions from UniProt for 10 619 genes involved in 15 030 fusion genes [27]. UniProt provides the loci information of 39 protein features, including 6 molecule processing features, 13 region features, 4 site features, 6 amino acid modification features, 2 natural variation features, 5 experimental info features, and 3 secondary structure features.

    > CellPhoneDB stores ligand-receptor interactions, as well as other properties of the interacting partners, including their subunit architecture and gene and protein identifiers. To create the content of the database, four main .csv data files are required: gene_input.csv, protein_input.csv, complex_input.csv and interaction_input.csv (Fig. 4).
    > gene_input Mandatory fields are 'gene_name', 'uniprot', 'hgnc_symbol' and 'ensembl'. This file is critical for establishing the link between the scRNA-seq data and the interaction pairs stored at the protein level. It includes the following gene and protein identifiers: (i) gene name ('gene_name'), (ii) UniProt identifier ('uniprot'), (iii) HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbol ('hgnc_symbol') and (iv) gene Ensembl identifier (ENSG) ('ensembl'). To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > The lists of proteins used for the comparison contain more items than listed previously due to expansion out of gene clusters, for example, to allow the updating and comparison of current HGNC gene symbols. These lists of proteins were compared in Microsoft Excel 2011 using PivotTable.
    > The protein set for the CHO midbody was derived from the accession numbers in Table S1 and Table S2 from Skop et al. [9]. Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.
    > The protein set for the HeLa spindle proteome is derived from the 1121 accession numbers in Sauer et al. supplementary table 1 column 2 [17]. Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.

    > Datasets can be inserted or uploaded to the web interface (Figure 2b). Data must be tab separated and formatted as shown in Figure 3A. They could include gene symbols and UniProt identifiers, which are used for the Gene Ontology annotation feature. To annotate a dataset which contains gene symbols and/ or UniProt identifiers, the appropriate organism can be set (Figure 2d) and the user can choose between full or slim GO annotation (Figure 2e) and full or experimental evidence (Figure 2f). The annotation is based on the gene and UniProt identifiers provided by UniProt-GOA and will be updated monthly.
    > It is essential that the first column contains the experimental value (log fold-change, isotope incorporation, intensity, etc.). Titles of the annotation columns are used to discriminate between different types of annotation in the results. If a pasted dataset already contains annotations such as KEGG and Pfam, these terms must reside in tab separated and titled columns (Figure 3A and online help). Annotations need to be located in the last columns. Importantly, semi-colons must separate multiple identifiers or terms in one column. For example, multiple identifiers are common for protein groups of mass spectrometric data and annotation will be done for all entries. Similarly, multiple terms are also common with Gene Ontology as one gene can be associated with several compartments at the same time and any of these terms will be treated independently. When columns of annotation are provided, the correct number of columns must be set in the respective spin-box in the web interface (Figure 2c). The dataset used in the example analysis already contains three annotation columns (KEGG, Pfam and InterPro) and is available on the web site of the tool as tab separated text file and Excel file (Figure 2a).
    > Regulation or the enrichment based on various statistics (estimators) can be tested depending on the focus of the analysis (Figure 2g). The number of resamplings R can be set in the range from 500 to 10,000 (Figure 2h).

    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > List of genes and genomic features (GFF) for Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 genome (PlasmoDB release 66) was downloaded and protein-coding genes were extracted along with their gene annotations and genomic location. Additional genomic annotations were obtained by querying PlasmoDB to extract UniProt and Entrez ID(s), ortholog group (OrthoMCL), protein features (CDS and protein length, molecular weight, isoelectric point), domain annotations (InterPro, Pfam, and Superfamily), number of transmembrane (TM) domains, and enzyme commission (EC) numbers. Gene function (Gene Ontology components, functions, and processes) was extracted either from PlasmoDB or by querying the InterPro ID with the InterPro2GO mapping tool from EMBL-EBI. Gene essentiality data was obtained for P. falciparum 20 and P. berghei 21,22 parasites mapped to their falciparum orthologs using OrthoMCL orthology group IDs. Protein Data Bank (PDB) IDs of crystal structures were obtained by searching either gene symbols, UniProt IDs associated with each gene, or the term "Plasmodium". A report with gene identifier, organism, accession number, method for structure determination and publication information was extracted for the search hits.
    > Mapping genes to associated literature publications A download from the NCBI FTP site was performed for gene2pubmed.gz (version 2024-02-21) containing taxonomy ID, gene ID (Entrez) and PubMed ID information. Gene IDs were mapped to the P. falciparum 3D7 annotation set, and corresponding PMIDs were extracted. To include literature references associated with gene symbols, we queried each symbol in PubMed using the Eutils 77 efetch function from NCBI; additional information for each publication was obtained pragmatically using the same tool, namely title, authors and digital object identifier (DOI). Literature references from gene nomenclature extraction were manually reviewed and filtered for unrelated records (e.g., same name but different meaning across organisms/diseases).
