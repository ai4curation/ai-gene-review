## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88HL4
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Nickel ABC transporter periplasmic binding protein {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68946.1}; EC=3.6.3.24 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68946.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=nikA {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68946.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_3342 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68946.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 5 family.
- **Key Domains:** CntA-like. (IPR011980); Peptide/Ni-bd. (IPR030678); SBP_5. (IPR039424); SBP_5_dom. (IPR000914); SBP_bac_5 (PF00496)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "nikA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'nikA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **nikA** (gene ID: nikA, UniProt: Q88HL4) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > In addition to the systematic experimental verification of novel annotations in three GO categories as described above, here we highlight individual predictions for which we found supporting evidence in the publicly available databases. This information was not available to the classifiers at the time when the models were constructed. The following examples are for E. coli K12, as this is by far the best-studied model prokaryote [21].
    > We predict genes hypC and hybG to have ''nickel cation binding.'' These genes had no GO terms assigned in the 07-02-2012 UniProt-GOA release (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/ P0AAM3 and http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0AAM7), and we therefore considered them unannotated. In the meantime, hypC was annotated with ''metal ion binding'' using experimental evidence: this is a parent GO term of our prediction. Moreover, when examining the literature, we found evidence that these two genes are involved in the biosynthesis of the [NiFe] cluster [22].
    > Another prediction is for gltL: we predicted it is annotated with ''ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complex.'' In line with our predictions, PortEco, a portal that includes information from 14 different E. coli data resources [23], labels the gene as ''ATPbinding component of ABC superfamily.'' Note that more general electronic GO annotations were available for this gene, e.g. ''ATP binding,'' ''ATPase activity,'' and ''ATP catabolic process'' (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0AAG3).
    > A similar prediction of a more detailed function is for ybgI, where we predict GO terms from both BP and MF ontologies. This gene is known to be a conserved metal-binding protein [24], having an electronic GO annotation ''metal ion binding''; we predict it is annotated with the BP GO term ''Mo-molybdopterin cofactor metabolic process.''

    > Genes overrepresented for nonsynonymous and structural mutations were classified into functional groups based on the functional annotation table constructed with DAVID v.2023q3 91,92 (Table S4). We established the following rules for generalizing genes into functional groups: Chaperone: genes that encode proteins that perform chaperone or chaperonin-like activities (Uniprot Keyword: KW-0143); Envelope: Genes that encode proteins involved in the maintenance of the cell-envelope such as phospholipid biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0008654) and peptidoglycan biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0000270); Metabolism: Genes that encode proteins involved in general metabolic functions, such as purine metabolism (KEGG: eco00230), amino acid metabolism (KEGG: eco00470, eco00330); or TCA Cycle (KEGG: eco00020); Regulators: Genes that encode proteins directly involved in transcription (GO-BP: 0031564; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0804), translation (GO-BP:0006412, GO-BP:0006413; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0689), or the regulation of transcription (GO-BP: 0006355, GO-BP:2000143, GO-BP:0006353, GO-BP: GO:0045893; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0805); and Transport: Genes that encode proteins involved in transport: such as ABC transporters (Interpro: PR017871), MFS transporters (Interpro: IPR011701); symporters (Interpro: IPR023954, IPR001204, IPR001734, IPR023025, IPR004840), or Antiporters (Interpro: IPR004771). A combination of resources were used to determine if a parallel mutation arose in a functional region of a protein including, EcoCyc, 96 UniProt, 97 and the primary literature (see supplemental bibliography).

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > Protein identifications with 2 peptides and a confident protein score (P <0.05) from the HpH fractionation and IDA-MS were used to assign subcellular localization. Using the top score given by WoLF PSORT [10] (www.genscript.com/wolf-psort.html) proteins were categorized into 8 locations. Membrane proteins were predicted using transmembrane helical Markov model (TMHMM) [11] (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Proteins in the solute carrier protein (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter families were identified according to gene and protein name. We also used website gene names (www.genenames.org/data) to characterise the subcellular location of the transporter and the type of substrate they transport.
    > For proteins annotated as 'uncharacterised' in figures and tables in the manuscript a BLAST protein homology search was carried out using the Ensembl or uniport accession code in uniprotKB (www.uniprot.org). The accession code page contains the sequence and a link to BLAST. BLASTp results against uniprotkb_Swissprot reference proteomes and an identity sequence match of >95.5% to human, bovine (cattle) or caprine (goat) proteome annotation was accepted as the protein name.

Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.
    > The protein set for the HeLa spindle proteome is derived from the 1121 accession numbers in Sauer et al. supplementary table 1 column 2 [17]. Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.

    > Sequence similarity analyses were accomplished using blastx [26] against the NCBI non-redundant database on protein level [32], the Swissprot database [33,34] and KEGG [35]. Additionally, manual gene annotation was performed using PRIAM [36], Motif Scan [37], Prosite  [38], BRENDA [39,40], UniProt/SwissProt [34], Inter-ProScan [41], and Pfam [42] databases. One example of how our manual annotation differed from that of the automated pipeline used by Brown et al. can be found in the case of CLAU_3519 (CAETHG_3609). Here the automated pipeline from the Brown et al. finished genome assigned this gene product as a hypothetical protein, however when the sequence was aligned using BLASTP as part of our manual curation all other proteins with >75 % identity were named sodium ABC transporter. Upon further inspection in Pfam, one large ABC-2 family transporter protein domain was found (E-value 6.8e-31). Similar searches of UniProt and KEGG databases agreed with Pfam, therefore we annotated this gene product as an ABC-2 family transporter. The correction of the previously short-called homopolymer reads through our sequencing efforts gave a fully annotated finished sequence of C. autoethanogenum without the erroneous frame-shift containing annotations which had occurred previously. Using these tools we were able to manually curate the entire genome to ensure that the automated annotation was correct and to insert additional information where required, as well as implementing a standardised protein product naming system as recommend by the NCBI guidelines [43] for ease of identification of genes with related functions. As a consequence of the automated and subsequent manual curation, we have found 482 instances across the genome where genes previously identified as 'hypothetical protein' have either been assigned a specific function, or have been named through identification of conserved domains based on sequence similarity.

    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > Although this is a fairly obvious requirement, it is not trivial to implement because a protein reagent expressed recombinantly is typically not the exact same entity or in the same state as its corresponding assay participant in a living cell (e.g., kinase domain binding assay vs. corresponding kinase occurring in a specific cell line used for a growth inhibition assay). In this first version of metadata standards, we take a rudimentary approach. We use the UniProt accession and approved Gene symbol (NCBI Gene) and accession number to identify and reference proteins and their coding genes, respectively. Although we recognize limitations, for the purpose of our current simple use cases, this is sufficient. Linking protein and gene identifiers in addition is relevant to integrate RNAi reagent gene targets (see below). The recommended explicit fields for proteins include a standardized name, both for the protein and the gene that encodes it; source of protein (e.g., chemically synthesized, purified from natural source, recombinantly expressed); protein modifications (e.g., mutations, posttranslational modification); protein purity; subunit information for components of a protein complex; and isoform information (derived from either alternative promoter usage, alternative splicing, alternative translation initiation, or frame shifting). We are currently working on a formal description of proteins that will allow ambiguity (more-or less-specific definition of proteins), because in some cases, the exact entity and state of a protein reagent or model system participant is not definitively known (full length, functional domain, exact sequence, mutation, phosphorylation state, etc.).

- Summary: The wild strain of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the DH5α strain of Escherichia coli were grown in their own specific media, then cultured for 48 hours and 72 hours by cultivating in media containing 0,1% glucose with different cell number, and finally the differentiation in the proteins released by the cells into the medium was observed in SDS polyacrylamide gels.

    > The proteins identified as a result of LC-MS/MS analysis were evaluated in UniProt and the names and functions of the proteins are given as an appendix. Here, 6 protein-coding genes in the bands of the proteins released into the medium by the co-culture were found in the S.pombe genome and were classified according to their biological functions and cellular locations using the online platform PANTHER (Figure 2). Other 257 protein-coding genes were found in the E. coli genome. These proteins were also classified according to their cellular location (Figure 3) and their cellular functions (Figure 4). Maltose/maltodextrin-binding periplasmic protein (malE) and D-galactose-binding periplasmic protein (mglB) found in E. coli cells are among the binding proteins found in LC-MS-MS results. The binding protein MglB has a high affinity for glucose (Ferenci, 1996), and at low glucose concentration, glucose is mainly taken up by cells in this way. In a study by Egli et al. (1993), giving 1.8 mg l−1 galactose to a low glucose-containing E. coli culture decreased the glucose utilization of the cells and led to glucose accumulation in continuous culture. In addition, Hua and., (2004) found that the expression of a series of genes encoding membrane transporter proteins was significantly induced in cultures of limited chemostats for various carbon sources, and that about half of these genes were maltose (all genes of malGFE and malK-lamB-malM operons), galactose. They showed that there are genes involved in a wide variety of high-affinity ABC transport systems that facilitate uptake (three genes of the mglBAC operon). In E. coli, the ABC transporter gene family covers approximately 5% of the entire genome (Linton and Higgins, 1998). This shows how important these genes are. Carbon-limited cultures have been proposed to investigate bacterial growth and behavior under environmental conditions (Matin, 1979;Moriarty, 1993;Morita, 1993).

    > UniProt is currently the main linking point to GO and KEGG pathway in SPLASH as it is a high quality and extensively cross-referenced information hub for protein sequences. While UniProt accession number is used for retrieving and integrating all known information about a protein, we use IPI sequence database for protein identification by MS and MS/MS experiments, as this database also includes annotated gene splice variants, thus ensuring protein identification with greater confidence. The identified protein is then assigned its UniProt accession number (if available) through cross-referencing between the two databases. However, for those proteins that are not in UniProt or have not been annotated with GO or KEGG data, our current approach is to find the sequence homologue of the unmatched protein and extract its UniProt accession number for further analysis. Although sequence homologues can be inferred to have similar function, it is possible that the protein identified by BLAST may not be the "correct" protein. Thus it may be annotated with incorrect GO or KEGG information. In addition, it is important to point out that some of the GO annotation is based on inferred from electronic annotation (IEA), known to be a source of errors as no curator has checked the annotation to verify its accuracy. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are in an active process of devising a reliability index for GO and KEGG annotation in order to improve data accuracy.

    > Case 2: From proteins to genes When working with protein interaction networks, for example those from the STRING database (see http:// apps.cytoscape.org/apps/stringapp), you may want to translate protein identifiers (e.g., Uniprot-TrEMBL) to gene identifiers. The idmapper app supports this case as well, but one should be aware of the assumptions involved when making this translation. Since most genes encode for many proteins, you may have many-to-one mappings in your results. For all human networks imported from STRING using the StringApp 5 , the following commands will perform an ID mapping from Uniprot-TrEMBL (proteins) to Ensembl (genes):
    > (RCy3): mapTableColumn(column="canonical name", species="Human", map.from="Uniprot-TrEMBL", map.to="Ensembl") (py2cytoscape): cyclient.idmapper.map_column(source_column="canonical name", species="Human", source_selection="Uniprot-TrEMBL", target_selection="Ensembl")
    > Case 3: Identifiers and symbols In contrast to gene names and symbols, identifiers provide a more reliable means of specifying a particular gene.
    > All data integration should be performed using identifiers as keys. Nevertheless, names and symbols play an important role in making results easier to read and understand. The idmapper app is primarily concerned with identifiers. However, relying on a subset of commonly used sources from BridgeDb (Table 1) it does provide one exception.

    > Next, from gene ontology analysis of those twenty genes using ShinyGO (v0.85) [28], we found only one cluster of eight genes, associated with the signaling and transportation mechanism of different substrates. These genes are rpa0466 (metalloprotease inhibitor), rpa2624 (sulfonate transport), rpa3362 (hypothetical protein), rpa3725 (ABC transporter substrate-binding protein), rpa3751 (cache domain-containing protein), rpa3872 (hypothetical protein), rpa4029 (ABC transporter substrate-binding protein), and rpa4571 (BA14K family protein). In R. palustris, the listed genes represent a diverse array of functions that contribute to the organism's metabolic versatility and environmental adaptability. rpa0466, a metalloprotease inhibitor, likely plays a regulatory role in proteolysis, protecting proteins from degradation under certain conditions [29]. rpa2624 is involved in sulfonate transport, enabling the organism to utilize sulfur from organic sources, which is important in sulfur-limited environments [30]. Both rpa3725 and rpa4029 are substrate-binding proteins of ABC transporters, which facilitate the uptake of various substrates critical for nutrient acquisition [31]. rpa3751, a cache domain-containing protein, is likely involved in sensing extracellular signals or nutrients, guiding cellular responses [32]. rpa3362 and rpa3872, both hypothetical proteins, might represent uncharacterized functions in metabolism or stress response. Lastly, rpa4571, a BA14K family protein, could have a role in stress resistance or environmental interactions [33]. Together, these genes reflect the complex regulatory, transport, and environmental sensing capabilities of R. palustris, enhancing its ability to thrive in diverse ecosystems. Comparing the result with gene ontology analysis, StringDB database could not predict any interaction among the proteins encoded by these genes. The lack of predicted interactions in StringDB, along with the high prevalence of hypothetical and unannotated genes in R. palustris, underscores the unique and relatively understudied nature of this organism.
