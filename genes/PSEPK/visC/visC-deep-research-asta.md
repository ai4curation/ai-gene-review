## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88CI4
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Oxidoreductase involved in anerobic synthesis of ubiquinone, FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70762.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=visC {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70762.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_5197 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70762.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the UbiH/COQ6 family.
- **Key Domains:** FAD-bd. (IPR002938); FAD/NAD-bd_sf. (IPR036188); Ubi_Hdrlase_CS. (IPR018168); UbiH/COQ6. (IPR010971); UbiH/COQ6_monooxygenase. (IPR051205)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "visC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'visC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **visC** (gene ID: visC, UniProt: Q88CI4) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > The database enables searching by gene symbols/names, GenBank accession numbers, UniGene cluster IDs, Swiss-Prot entry names and several unique clone IDs (IMAGE clone IDs, University of Iowa clone IDs, Operon oligo IDs, TAIR IDs and a subset of selected Affymetrix and Agilent IDs).
    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

- Summary: A comprehensive protein localization analysis of essential genes in 27 prokaryotes including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and 1 archaeon has been performed and shows that proteins encoded by essential genes are enriched in internal location sites, while exist in cell envelope with a lower proportion compared with non-essential ones.

    > Bioinformatics Databases. DEG is a database of essential genes (http://www. essentialgene.org/). The newly released DEG 10 has been developed to accommodate the quantitative and qualitative advancements brought by the progressive identification methods. Currently available records of both essential and nonessential genes among a wide range of organisms can be downloaded from DEG 10, making it possible to compare the two different types of genes in many aspects 21 .
    > 27 prokaryotic organisms including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and Methanococcus maripaludis S2, the only record of the Archaea domain were selected to analyze the protein localization and GO distribution of the essential and nonessential genes. There are 31 bacterial records corresponding to 27 organisms in the database in total and 26 sets of data were selected in the current study. Streptococcus pneumonia was not chosen for the lack of non-essential genes. Since the essential genes were not genome-widely identified, it's not reasonable to regard the complementary set of essential genes as non-essential genes in Streptococcus pneumonia 29,30 . In the case of multiple records for one organism, the one with the most convincing experimental methods was chosen. The non-essential genes in Methanococcus maripaludis S2 and 13 bacteria such as Escherichia coli MG1655 are obtained based on the original literatures, while non-essential genes in other 12 organisms such as Bacillus subtilis 168 are the complementary set of essential genes. The information of the organisms used in the current study are displayed in Table 1.
    > The three model genomes' subcellular location information and the Gene Ontology (GO) terms used for the analysis in the current study were downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt; http://www.uniprot.org). Maintained by the UniProt Consortium, UniProt is committed to providing biologists with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and functional annotation 27 . Among the wealth of annotation data, detailed GO annotation statements are included.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Labelling of such a gene as "inactivated" seems biologically correct. This is translated to the CDS qualifier /pseudo in EMBL and securely ensures that the protein translation is not present in UniProt (e.g., searching for OE_1059R results in no hit). When, however, an invalid partial translation product is produced but not tagged as disrupted (as is the case for VNG0034H), then this is considered by EMBL as a "regular" gene (CDS). Such a gene fragment is included as a regular protein in UniProt (VNG0034H is Q9HSX6). Upon superficial analysis, this may be taken as evidence for an "improved" (because less incomplete) genome annotation in strain NRC-1 compared to strain R1. In addition, according to EMBL requirements, the "CDS" coordinates of OE_1059R must be given as 29913-31570, thus covering and including the integrated transposon ISH1 (with its transposase gene). Only a "tolerated" misc_feature annotation allows representation of this disrupted gene in a biologically meaningful way, representing the reconstructed ancestral gene.

This involved in putting the target gene names and restricting the search to the human species, ensuring that all target gene names were accurately converted to their official gene symbols. Subsequently, the acquired data underwent further analysis with a significance threshold of P < 0.05.

    > The ultimate goal of the functional annotation process (Figure 4) is to assign biologically relevant information to predicted polypeptides, and to the features they derive from (e.g. gene, mRNA). This process is especially relevant nowadays in the context of the NGS era due to the capacity of sequencing, assembling, and annotating full genomes in short periods of time, e.g. less than a month. Functional elements could range from putative name and/or symbols for protein-coding genes, e.g. ADH to its putative biological function, e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase, associated gene ontology terms, e.g. GO:0004022, functional sites, e.g. METAL 47 47 Zinc 1, and domains, e.g. IPR002328, among other features. The function of predicted proteins can be computationally inferred based on the similarity between the sequence of interest and other sequences in different public repositories, e.g. BLASTP against Uniprot. Caution should be taken when assigning results merely based on sequence similarity as two evolutionary independent sequences which share some common domains could be considered homologs 62 . Thus, whenever possible, it is better to use orthologous sequences for annotation purposes rather than simply similar sequences 63 . With the growing number of sequences in those public repositories, it is possible to perform various searches and combine obtained results into a consensus annotation. The accurate assignment of the functional elements is a complex process, and the best annotation will involve manual curation.
    > There are two main outcomes of the functional annotation process. The first is the assignment of functional elements to genes. Downstream analysis of these elements allow further understanding of specific genome properties, e.g. metabolic pathways, and similarities compared with closely related species. The second result of the functional annotation is the additional quality check for the predicted gene set. It is possible to identify problematic and/or suspicious genes by the presence of specific domains, suspicious orthology assignment and/or absence of other functional elements, e.g. functional completeness.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > To obtain basic information on WERs and their target genes, such as official gene symbols, gene IDs, gene types, and genomic locations, gene annotations were downloaded from the GENCODE project [ 44 ] for human and mouse, and from NCBI [ 45 ] and Ensembl [ 46 ] for the other species. Genomic locations were extracted from the corresponding GTF annotation files. Gene symbols were primarily standardized based on the NCBI Gene database [ 45 ] for mRNAs and lncRNAs, GtR-NAdb [ 47 ] for tRNAs, miRbase [ 48 ] for microRNAs, and cir-cBase [ 49 ] for circRNAs. Deprecated or substituted versions of genes were filtered out. The LiftOver [ 50 ] program was employed to convert and unify genomic coordinates across different genome assembly versions.
    > The functional descriptions of WERs were compiled based on the UniProt database [ 51 ] and further supplemented with evidence from relevant publications, with particular emphasis on their functions as RNA modification regulatory proteins.

    > 3. Gene annotation and functional annotation. a. Gene structure annotation.
    > In addition to gene prediction models, evidence from orthologous protein sequences and transcriptome assembly could be used to improve annotation quality. Protein sequences of orthologous genes can be obtained from UniProt (The UniProt, 2017). Ones from Swiss-Port have been reviewed and thus are of higher quality. Transcriptome assembly may be available from previous studies or can be assembled de novo from RNA-seq reads by Trinity (Haas et al., 2013). High quality transcriptome assembly can be selected as described in (Zhang et al., 2021). Note: Details about gene structure annotation (Holt and Yandell, 2011) can be found at http:// gmod.org/wiki/MAKER_Tutorial, https://darencard.net/blog/2017-05-16-maker-genomeannotation/, and the protocol (Campbell et al., 2014).
    > b. Quality measurement and functional annotation.
    > For each predicted gene, Maker2 provides the annotation edit distance (AED) score, which measures the goodness of fit between its predicted gene structure and its evidence support. The lower the score, the more accurate the prediction. If more than 90% genes with AED scores lower than 0.5, the genome can be considered well annotated. In addition to the AED score, a high proportion of recognizable domains contained in predicted protein -e.g., higher than 50% -also indicates a good annotation. Recognizable protein domains can by scanned by InterProScan (Jones et al., 2014), assigning potential function to predicted genes.
    > Note: Besides the aforementioned quality measurement, we strongly recommend measuring the completeness of the genome assembly and annotation by checking the existence of a set of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) (Simao et al., 2015). A high-level completeness of genome assembly and annotation is imperative for a better identification of gene expansion. Based on the result of this analysis, researchers can decide whether they need to further improve the genome assembly before predicting gene expansion. A detailed protocol of BUSCO is available at

    > To assign functional or gene categories, we integrated cancer genes, tumor suppressors, epigenetic regulators, DNA damage repair genes, human essential genes, kinases and transcription factors. In each gene group, we checked the retention and ORFs of the main protein functional features. There are 13 features belonging to the 'region' category, including 'calcium binding', 'coiled coil', 'compositional bias', 'DNA binding', 'domain', 'intramembrane', 'motif', 'nucleotide binding', 'region', 'repeat', 'topological domain', 'transmembrane' and 'zinc finger'. To perform the protein functional feature retention search, we first downloaded the GFF (General Feature Format) format protein information of 10 651 UniProt accessions from UniProt for 10 619 genes involved in 15 030 fusion genes ( 10 ). UniProt provides the loci information of 39 protein features, including six molecule processing features, 13 region features, four site features, six amino acid modification features, two natural variation features, five experimental info features and three secondary structure features. Since such feature loci information is based on amino acid sequences, the genomic breakpoint information was converted into the amino acid level while considering all UniProt protein accessions, ENST isoforms and multiple breakpoints for each partner. To map each feature to the human genome sequence, we used the GENCODE (v19) gene model of human reference genome ( 11 ). For the 5 -partner gene, we considered the protein feature to be retained in the fusion gene if the breakpoints occurred on the 3 -end of the protein feature. On the contrary, if a protein domain was not entirely included in the fusion amino acid sequence, we reported such fusion genes as having not retained that protein feature. Similarly, for the 3partner gene, we considered the fusion gene to have retained the protein feature if the breakpoints occurred on the 5 -end of the protein feature region.

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

    > 25. Enrichment analysis using R package UniprotR. Note: The functional enrichment analysis of the differential proteins is performed using R package UniprotR. 16 In our paper, we utilized the online functional enrichment analysis tool Metascape. 25 However, there is no R version of Metascape. Another R package, clusterProfiler, is commonly used in enrichment analysis. 10 Since clusterProfiler only supports ENTREZ ID, protein accession numbers or protein names must be converted into ENTREZ ID using ID transformation R packages, such as org.Hs.eg.db (https://bioconductor.org/packages/ release/data/annotation/html/org.Hs.eg.db.html), biomaRt, 26 or gconvert function in g:pro-filer2. 27 It is important to note, however, that not all protein accessions or protein names can be successfully connected to ENTREZ IDs using these tools. Interestingly, UniprotR is ideally suited for proteomics results due to its ability to use all accession numbers or protein names for enrichment analysis.

    > Recorded for each protein of the mass spectrometry data sets were, where available, the original protein identifier, subcellular location, sequence of identified peptides, sequence coverage, and the experimental techniques that had been used for the purification, separation, and identification of the protein. If the original protein identifier could not be mapped to a UniProt primary accession number by PIR ID or MGI, then the protein was compared with proteins in UniProt by using BLASTP (14). If there was a significant match, then the UniProt primary accession number was assigned to the protein. Those proteins without a significant match were discarded. By using the PIR ID and the MGI identifier conversion tools, the evidence of mitochondrial localization for a protein was linked to many of the UniProt entries representing it. Identifiers of proteins encoded in the mitochondrial genome of organisms were taken from the Organelle database of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute and used to annotate the appropriate proteins in MitoMiner.
    > The source of protein sequences, related features, and annotation was UniProt (11). All UniProt entries were downloaded for the six species with mitochondrial localization data sets. The literature citations in each UniProt entry were retrieved from PubMed by using an InterMine parser. Additional Gene Ontology annotation on the biological process, metabolic function, and cellular component of each protein was taken from UniProt (15) and individual genome projects of M. musculus (12), Rattus norvegicus (16), Drosophila melanogaster (17), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (18).
    > Finally lists of human genes and the descriptions of their associated disease phenotypes were taken from OMIM (19), the definitions of groups of homologous proteins were taken from HomoloGene (20), and data on the reactions, enzymes, and compounds of metabolic pathways were taken from KEGG (21). The EC numbers of proteins in UniProt were used to define the cross-reference between proteins and metabolic pathways.
