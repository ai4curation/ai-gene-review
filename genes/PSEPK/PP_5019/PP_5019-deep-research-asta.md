## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88D10
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase E {ECO:0000256|PIRNR:PIRNR015601}; EC=2.1.1.193 {ECO:0000256|PIRNR:PIRNR015601};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_5019 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70584.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the RNA methyltransferase RsmE family.
- **Key Domains:** Alpha/beta_knot_MTases. (IPR029028); RsmE. (IPR006700); RsmE_MTase_dom. (IPR046886); tRNA_m1G_MTases_N. (IPR029026); Methyltrans_RNA (PF04452)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_5019" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_5019' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_5019** (gene ID: PP_5019, UniProt: Q88D10) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

### [3] The USDA-ARS Ag100Pest Initiative: High-Quality Genome Assemblies for Agricultural Pest Arthropod Research
- Authors: Anna K. Childers, S. Geib, S. Sim, Monica F. Poelchau, B. Coates et al.
- Year: 2021
- Venue: Insects
- URL: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a33d31da6f5aee18501cfc2332ff50d5b7f23508

- PMID: 34357286
- PMCID: 8307976
- Citations: 41
- Influential citations: 2
- Summary: It is shown that the Ag100Pest Initiative will greatly expand the diversity of publicly available arthropod genome assemblies and demonstrate the high quality of preliminary contig assemblies, which should help other researchers attain similarly high-quality assemblies.

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

### [4] CRONOS: the cross-reference navigation server

- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.735)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > It is well known that protein names are highly ambiguous [45,46]. Researchers working in specific subcommunities tend to develop their own nomenclature, resulting in multiple names for the same protein. Acronyms and abbreviations further complicate the picture. Simply being able to recognize a protein name as such is just a starting point. The name needs then to be unambiguously qualified, by referring to an entry in a standard protein database, such as UniProt http:// www.expasy.org/sprot/ [47].
    > In order for that to happen, the disambiguation must occur at two levels: interspecies (to which specific organisms does the protein mention refer?) and intraspecies (within a given organism, which specific protein is meant?). For example, a protein mentioned in text as eIF4E could refer to a large number of different proteins. A search in the Swiss-Prot section of UniProt (the manually curated section) delivers 46 possible matches. However, if the term appears contextually with the mention of a specific organism, like in the sentence 'The Cap-binding protein eIF4E promotes folding of a functional domain of yeast translation initiation factor eIF4G1' (PubMed: 10409688), then it is reasonable to assume that the name refers to a specific organism (yeast), thus restricting the possible matches in UniProt to the following two: EAP1_YEAST (eIF4E-associated protein 1) and IF4E_YEAST (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E). For the task of protein annotation, we have adopted a high-recall, low-precision term annotation approach, followed by very strict disambiguation steps, which gradually increase precision (at some expense for recall).
    > UniProt contains for each protein a list of frequently used synonyms, as well as the name and synonyms of its encoding gene.

    > As previously described (Triant et al. 2020), once a proteincoding gene annotation is complete, each new or modified isoform should be compared to a well-curated protein sequence database to check for congruency with known proteins. The sequence of an annotation is obtained by right clicking it and selecting Get Sequence. The first choice of database to search is the well-curated UniProtKB/Swissprot database using BLAST at either the UniProt (https:// www. unipr ot. org/ blast) or NCBI website (https:// blast. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ Blast. cgi) (Sayers et al. 2023a;UniProt Consortium 2023). If there is no match with a significant e-value (< 1e−05) in UniProtKB/Swissprot, the next database to try is the Model Organisms (landmark) database at NCBI. If that fails, select the RefSeq Proteins database and exclude your organism of interest from the search. Although RefSeq includes computationally predicted and hypothetical proteins, an alignment to a homologous protein from another organism provides support for the annotation. An alignment that covers the full length of both the annotated protein and the database protein sequence suggests the annotation is correct. An alignment that encompasses the full length of an annotated protein sequence but only part of a database protein suggests that the annotation is truncated. You may be able to correct the annotation with additional evidence, but if there is not sufficient evidence the issue can be noted in the Annotation Information Panel under the Comment tab. A partial alignment of an annotated protein to a database protein suggests the annotation has a reading frame shift or was extended incorrectly. Aligning the coding sequence (CDS) to the protein database will reveal whether the problem is due to a reading frame shift. Further annotation editing should be performed to correct the reading frame. If an incorrect extension was due to the merging of two genes, you should edit or redo the annotation. Any unresolved issues should be entered in the Comment section of the Annotation Information Panel.

    > Genome annotation was performed following established guidelines (Haas et al. 2011 (Slater & Birney 2005). Predicted gene models exhibiting strong evidence by exon alignment were exported as protein sequences and coding nucleotide sequences (CDS). Predicted gene models lacking evidence from exon alignment were discarded in downstream analyses. To determine function, the protein sequences were used as input for InterProScan 5RC6 (Jones et al. 2014) (parameters: -dp -f -t p -iprlookup -pa -goterms) and were also compared to the manually curated protein data set from UniProt/Swiss-Prot by blastp v. 2.2.28+. The results in XML format from blastp v. 2.2.28+ and InterProScan were loaded into Blast2GO v. 2.7.1 (Conesa et al. 2005) and merged to create an annotation table (available from the first author on request). The gene models with BLAST hits having e-value of less than 1.0E -100 and mean similarity hit of ≥ 70% were assumed to be orthologs and they were given names following recommended conventions (http:// www.uniprot.org/docs/proknameprot). Ribosomal RNA's were predicted by RNAmmer v. 1.2 (Lagesen et al. 2007).

    > Although this is a fairly obvious requirement, it is not trivial to implement because a protein reagent expressed recombinantly is typically not the exact same entity or in the same state as its corresponding assay participant in a living cell (e.g., kinase domain binding assay vs. corresponding kinase occurring in a specific cell line used for a growth inhibition assay). In this first version of metadata standards, we take a rudimentary approach. We use the UniProt accession and approved Gene symbol (NCBI Gene) and accession number to identify and reference proteins and their coding genes, respectively. Although we recognize limitations, for the purpose of our current simple use cases, this is sufficient. Linking protein and gene identifiers in addition is relevant to integrate RNAi reagent gene targets (see below). The recommended explicit fields for proteins include a standardized name, both for the protein and the gene that encodes it; source of protein (e.g., chemically synthesized, purified from natural source, recombinantly expressed); protein modifications (e.g., mutations, posttranslational modification); protein purity; subunit information for components of a protein complex; and isoform information (derived from either alternative promoter usage, alternative splicing, alternative translation initiation, or frame shifting). We are currently working on a formal description of proteins that will allow ambiguity (more-or less-specific definition of proteins), because in some cases, the exact entity and state of a protein reagent or model system participant is not definitively known (full length, functional domain, exact sequence, mutation, phosphorylation state, etc.).

Given the low amount of functional (GO) annotation in our largest assembly, C. shasta þ NHP (see Results), we used BlastX to search for homologs of genes of interest in two custom concatenated databases that comprised the Cell Migration Knowledge Database (CMKB) which includes proteins, families, and complexes involved in cell migration (http://www.cellmigration. org/index.shtml, last accessed February 5, 2015; $7,600 protein sequences), and the MEROPS database, which consists of a nr library of full-length sequences of peptidases and peptidase inhibitors (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/, last accessed December 2, 2014; $450,000 sequences; Rawlings et al. 2016). We searched using the longest representatives for each gene in the C. shasta þ NHP assembly (23,418 contigs; IIR-RBT6) then parsed matches (bit score > 100) and posteriorly classified homologs to proteases or motility genes matching the specific databases. We then selected only genes with the same annotation in UniProt (determined using the same standards: no ambiguous terms filtering, bit score > 100) to confirm gene identity. Due to disagreements between annotations (CMKB vs. UniProt, and MEROPS vs. UniProt), we curated gene lists manually, removing genes that matched one or more of the following criteria: 1) no genetic distances available (only available for reference); 2) disagreements between annotations from the different databases, after checking for synonyms or function similarity; 3) annotations that contained terms from UniProt "Uncharacterized protein" and "Predicted protein" (ambiguous terms), and whose identity could not be confirmed; and 4) annotations that contained nonspecific terms, such as "heat shock protein" or "ribosomal protein."

    > In addition to gene prediction models, evidence from orthologous protein sequences and transcriptome assembly could be used to improve annotation quality. Protein sequences of orthologous genes can be obtained from UniProt (The UniProt, 2017). Ones from Swiss-Port have been reviewed and thus are of higher quality. Transcriptome assembly may be available from previous studies or can be assembled de novo from RNA-seq reads by Trinity (Haas et al., 2013). High quality transcriptome assembly can be selected as described in (Zhang et al., 2021). Note: Details about gene structure annotation (Holt and Yandell, 2011) can be found at http:// gmod.org/wiki/MAKER_Tutorial, https://darencard.net/blog/2017-05-16-maker-genomeannotation/, and the protocol (Campbell et al., 2014).
    > b. Quality measurement and functional annotation.
    > For each predicted gene, Maker2 provides the annotation edit distance (AED) score, which measures the goodness of fit between its predicted gene structure and its evidence support. The lower the score, the more accurate the prediction. If more than 90% genes with AED scores lower than 0.5, the genome can be considered well annotated. In addition to the AED score, a high proportion of recognizable domains contained in predicted protein -e.g., higher than 50% -also indicates a good annotation. Recognizable protein domains can by scanned by InterProScan (Jones et al., 2014), assigning potential function to predicted genes.
    > Note: Besides the aforementioned quality measurement, we strongly recommend measuring the completeness of the genome assembly and annotation by checking the existence of a set of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) (Simao et al., 2015). A high-level completeness of genome assembly and annotation is imperative for a better identification of gene expansion. Based on the result of this analysis, researchers can decide whether they need to further improve the genome assembly before predicting gene expansion. A detailed protocol of BUSCO is available at

GO molecular function terms that were significantly enriched in at least two out of the three comparisons are summarized in Figure S1.
    > For the upregulated genes, GO molecular function terms associated with binding activities (ATP, nucleic acid, RNA, Adenyl ribonucleotide/nucleotide small molecule, organic cyclic compounds), transferase activity (methyl, one-carbon group), helicase, and ATP-dependent activities were significantly enriched, suggesting the potential role of these key molecular functions following insecticide selection. Of note, GO terms associated with methyltransferase activity were significantly enriched in the upregulated genes. Among these, tRNA (cytosine34-C5)-methyltransferase (AAEL013968) was consistently detected among the top 10 DE genes from all three F S4 vs. F S0 comparisons. This may suggest the involvement of the RNA methylation process in response to insecticide selection; however, direct evidence for DNA or RNA methylation in Ae. aegypti under deltamethrin exposure is currently lacking.

This homolog was then used to search the STRING database using different identifiers (Uniprot ID, Uniprot Ensembl, RefSeq and Genome Reviews accession numbers and gene names in this order). If no STRING homolog was found using this textual search, a BLASTP search was performed on STRING human protein sequences and the first best hit (E-value ≤ 1e-05) was chosen. Then, STRING networks were built (combined score cut-off ≥ 0.9) and sub-networks were extracted by retrieving level 1 neighbours for each protein. These small sub-networks were scored by the Ratio of consistency (Rc), defined as the ratio between the observed number of sub-network edges (protein-protein interactions)
