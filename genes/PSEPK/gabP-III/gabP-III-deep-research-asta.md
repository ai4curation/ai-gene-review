## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88IT8
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Gamma-aminobutyrate permease {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68519.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=gabP-III {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68519.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_2911 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68519.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** AA-permease/SLC12A_dom. (IPR004841); Amino_acid_permease_CS. (IPR004840); GABA_permease. (IPR011265); AA_permease (PF00324)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "gabP-III" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'gabP-III' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **gabP-III** (gene ID: gabP-III, UniProt: Q88IT8) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

I believe that an unrelated fragment of text was copy-pasted into the second sentence of the paragraph ("Many mutations that altered bacterial clearance...") 6. Supplementary text, p. 12, final paragraph. It should be Rv1191, not Rv1191c. Could you also add a short explanation why you believe it should be classified as a cathepsin (what protein did you transfer this annotation from)?
    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

### [3] CRONOS: the cross-reference navigation server
- Authors: Brigitte Waegele, I. Dunger, G. Fobo, Corinna Montrone, H. Mewes et al.
- Year: 2008
- Venue: Bioinformatics
- URL: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c05b3aa0ba01c41ee97c2dc98ea7b5b14ce0e9c
- DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn590

- Summary: CRONOS, a cross-reference server that contains entries from five mammalian organisms presented by major gene and protein information resources, is developed, which shows that the cross-references are highly accurate.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.718)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > Labelling of such a gene as "inactivated" seems biologically correct. This is translated to the CDS qualifier /pseudo in EMBL and securely ensures that the protein translation is not present in UniProt (e.g., searching for OE_1059R results in no hit). When, however, an invalid partial translation product is produced but not tagged as disrupted (as is the case for VNG0034H), then this is considered by EMBL as a "regular" gene (CDS). Such a gene fragment is included as a regular protein in UniProt (VNG0034H is Q9HSX6). Upon superficial analysis, this may be taken as evidence for an "improved" (because less incomplete) genome annotation in strain NRC-1 compared to strain R1. In addition, according to EMBL requirements, the "CDS" coordinates of OE_1059R must be given as 29913-31570, thus covering and including the integrated transposon ISH1 (with its transposase gene). Only a "tolerated" misc_feature annotation allows representation of this disrupted gene in a biologically meaningful way, representing the reconstructed ancestral gene.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Scientists can find querying datasets useful to identify expression levels between disease and normal pairs to discover differential expression for a gene. They may also want to research on potential biomarkers or pathways that lead to tumor formation or want to explore the overall expression of specific genes across multiple cancer types. Users can search BioXpress using HGNCapproved gene symbols (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee), UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot accessions or RefSeq accessions. Differentially expressed genes for a specific cancer type can also be retrieved. Additionally, all data in BioXpress, including lists of genes significantly differentially expressed in two or more cancer types, can be downloaded.
    > Searching using gene name (gene/protein-centric search)
    > A search using the HGNC-approved gene symbol or UniProt/RefSeq accession retrieves differential expression information (cancer vs. normal), tumor-only expression data (where normal samples are not available) and baseline expression information from normal human tissues (Illumina Human Body Map Project). The example below provides an overview of a gene/protein-centric search.

    > Many public databases of gene information are available (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16). However, different public databases often use different sets of unique identifiers (IDs) to describe the same genes or homologous genes in different species. One challenge of comparing large-scale biological datasets is the unification of gene names; otherwise, researchers spend a lot of effort in converting gene IDs when searching different databases. Another is the likelihood of missing some databases due to unfamiliarity; this is particularly true for clinicians and researchers who are specialized in inner ear research but are not necessarily familiar with genomics and bioinformatics. One goal of the SHIELD is to integrate relevant gene annotation information from various public databases in one centralized location.
    > For the SHIELD, annotations were derived from public databases and literature. Currently implemented annotations include official gene symbols, description of the gene name and synonyms, human and mouse chromosome cytogenetic banding, RefSeq RNA and protein (for protein coding genes) accession numbers, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez gene ID, genomic coordinates in both mouse reference genome assemblies mm9 and mm10, Ensembl, the Vertebrate Genome Annotation Database (VEGA) Mouse Genome Informatics, UniProt, Online Mendalian Inheritance in Man and gene ontology.
    > For each protein coding genes, we display all UniProt protein isoforms for that gene, the length in amino acid residues and the predicted number of transmembrane domains (TMs). We predicted TMs by running TMHMM2.0 run on all UniProt protein isoforms of each gene (17). The number of TMs is of special interest for research in sensory function, because many key proteins involved in signaling-such as the mechanotransduction ion channels-are integral membrane proteins. This information would help identify candidate genes for the components of the mechanotransduction apparatus of the inner ear.
    > We also performed manual curation of inner ear disorders including syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss according to the Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org) and primary literature.

- Summary: A comprehensive protein localization analysis of essential genes in 27 prokaryotes including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and 1 archaeon has been performed and shows that proteins encoded by essential genes are enriched in internal location sites, while exist in cell envelope with a lower proportion compared with non-essential ones.

    > Bioinformatics Databases. DEG is a database of essential genes (http://www. essentialgene.org/). The newly released DEG 10 has been developed to accommodate the quantitative and qualitative advancements brought by the progressive identification methods. Currently available records of both essential and nonessential genes among a wide range of organisms can be downloaded from DEG 10, making it possible to compare the two different types of genes in many aspects 21 .
    > 27 prokaryotic organisms including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and Methanococcus maripaludis S2, the only record of the Archaea domain were selected to analyze the protein localization and GO distribution of the essential and nonessential genes. There are 31 bacterial records corresponding to 27 organisms in the database in total and 26 sets of data were selected in the current study. Streptococcus pneumonia was not chosen for the lack of non-essential genes. Since the essential genes were not genome-widely identified, it's not reasonable to regard the complementary set of essential genes as non-essential genes in Streptococcus pneumonia 29,30 . In the case of multiple records for one organism, the one with the most convincing experimental methods was chosen. The non-essential genes in Methanococcus maripaludis S2 and 13 bacteria such as Escherichia coli MG1655 are obtained based on the original literatures, while non-essential genes in other 12 organisms such as Bacillus subtilis 168 are the complementary set of essential genes. The information of the organisms used in the current study are displayed in Table 1.
    > The three model genomes' subcellular location information and the Gene Ontology (GO) terms used for the analysis in the current study were downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt; http://www.uniprot.org). Maintained by the UniProt Consortium, UniProt is committed to providing biologists with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and functional annotation 27 . Among the wealth of annotation data, detailed GO annotation statements are included.

    > In order to identify enzymes among glycolytic interactors, we used the EC number in the Uniprot reference proteome [34]. Similarly, we used the Uniprot GO (Gene Ontology) terms to map proteins to biological processes, including "metabolic process" to find metabolic proteins or proteins not known to be involved in any metabolic pathway. This information was verified using annotations from KEGG [35] to identify proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism or other processes, such as environmental information processing. Lastly, we identified essential genes/proteins using the Database of Essential Genes (DEG version 15.2) [36].

    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

- Summary: Four curators from different MODs describe the literature curation process and highlight approaches taken by the four MODs to address: (1) the decision process by which papers are selected, and (2) the identification and prioritization of the data contained in the paper.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.659)
    > The first step in curating a paper is the identification of the genes and proteins described as well as the organism to which they belong (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, one of the more difficult challenges a biocurator can face is unambiguously linking the gene or genes discussed in a paper to a record in their MOD, particularly when the gene nomenclature is unclear or the research organism is not identified. Inclusion of sequence or database identifiers for each gene in the paper ensures accurate linking between the results presented in that paper and the particular gene or genes described therein, no matter how the name of a gene may change over time. Papers that lack this information may be impossible to curate. Nomenclature standards and collaborative efforts often strive to give orthologous genes the same symbol and name in multiple species. For example, MGI, under the auspices of the International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice (Maltais et al. 2002), and the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC, Bruford et al. 2008), works to co-ordinate nomenclature between mouse, human and rat genes. ZFIN attempts to name zebrafish genes after their human or mouse orthologs. Likewise, ArkDB (Hu et al. 2001) which maintains data on cat, chicken, cow, horse and sheep, adopts the HGNC nomenclature. Consequently, when a paper mentions a gene or protein symbol that is the same in several organisms (such as BRCA1, which is used in more than a dozen species) and it does not state the specific organism of origin or provide a sequence accession number for this particular gene, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether the data in that paper belongs in a particular species-specific database or not. Another nomenclature conundrum for many model organisms is the case where the same symbol is used for more than one gene in a single species. For example, the symbol PAP1 in Arabidopsis thaliana is the primary symbol or alias for four different genes (PURPLE ACID PHOSPHATASE 1, PHOSPHATIDIC ACID PHOSPHATASE 1, PRODUC-TION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT 1, and PHY-TOCHROME-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1).

    > The lists of proteins used for the comparison contain more items than listed previously due to expansion out of gene clusters, for example, to allow the updating and comparison of current HGNC gene symbols. These lists of proteins were compared in Microsoft Excel 2011 using PivotTable.
    > The protein set for the CHO midbody was derived from the accession numbers in Table S1 and Table S2 from Skop et al. [9]. Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.
    > The protein set for the HeLa spindle proteome is derived from the 1121 accession numbers in Sauer et al. supplementary table 1 column 2 [17]. Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.
