## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88QR8
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Aminodeoxychorismate synthase / para-aminobenzoate synthase multi-enzyme complex {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66050.1}; EC=2.6.1.85 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66050.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=pabA {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66050.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_0420 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66050.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Anth_synth/Amidotransfase. (IPR050472); Class_I_gatase-like. (IPR029062); GATASE. (IPR017926); TrpG/PapA_dom. (IPR006221); GATase (PF00117)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "pabA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'pabA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **pabA** (gene ID: pabA, UniProt: Q88QR8) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > The identification of hyaluronan-associated genes was performed using Python 3.10.12. The UniProt REST Web Application Programming Interface (API) was used to query and retrieve gene annotations that met specific criteria (UniProt Consortium). A keyword-based query, utilizing the terms "hyaluronan, " "hyaluronic acid, " "hyaluronidase, " "hyaluronic acid synthase, " "hyaluronate binding protein, " "hyaluronan oligosaccharides, " "hyaluronan synthase, " and "hyaluronan receptor, " was executed across our dataset of 663 genes. Gene symbols were returned as "hits" when the query keywords were found in the annotations, including functional comments, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and cross-referenced databases, formatted in JSON.

- Summary: CRONOS, a cross-reference server that contains entries from five mammalian organisms presented by major gene and protein information resources, is developed, which shows that the cross-references are highly accurate.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.699)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.692)
    > The database enables searching by gene symbols/names, GenBank accession numbers, UniGene cluster IDs, Swiss-Prot entry names and several unique clone IDs (IMAGE clone IDs, University of Iowa clone IDs, Operon oligo IDs, TAIR IDs and a subset of selected Affymetrix and Agilent IDs).
    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.670)
    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.668)
    > There are 128 proteins in UniProt that contain the word 'syntase', an incorrect spelling of the word 'synthase'. To put this into context, the RefSeq entry for Rhizobium etli CFN 42 (accession NC_007761) assigns the function 'dihydrofolate syntase' to gene folC. This has propagated into other databases such as UniProt (accession: Q2KE79), KEGG (accession: RHE_CH00024), and xBASE (accession: RHE_CH00024). If a user was to visit any of these databases and search for 'dihydrofolate synthase' the misspelled entries would be omitted from the search results. Large scale detection and correction of spelling mistakes in public databases is a difficult task, and so there is a reliance on the submitter to correct these. Automatic annotation pipelines simply copy and propagate what is there already. Spelling mistakes may be highlighted by the validation software provided by the public databases during submission, however, an alternative correct spelling isn't offered, making it difficult to amend the mistakes without manual intervention.
    > This can be solved by writing rules to find spelling mistakes [16]. However, this approach is limited to spelling mistakes which are explicitly written in the code. A solution may exist beyond biological science. The search engine Google upon receiving the input 'syntase' automatically states 'Did you mean: synthase'. There are programming languages which have classes or plugins to produce such 'did you mean' results [50,51]. 'Same gene name, different product name'
    > This issue occurs when two features, either within or between genomes, are assigned the same short gene name yet different product names. The NCBI validation software specifically highlights when this occurs intra-genomically with the description 'Same gene name, different product name' [9,10]. In the current set of 2696 microbial genome and plasmid sequences in RefSeq, we detected 23,843 genes with at least two different product names (see http:// www.ark-genomics.org/genomeannotation.html for the full list).

    > Gene annotation was primarily derived from the S. clavuligerus reference genome in the NCBI database and was annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline 59 . However, several CA biosynthetic genes were manually corrected based on published literature 9 . For instance, two loci were originally annotated as clavaminate synthase 1 (cas1), but one of these loci is located near the cephamycin C biosynthetic cluster, indicating it was actually cas2. Following this correction, the RefSeq accession numbers of all genes in the reference genome were cross-referenced with the UniProt database to obtain additional annotations 60 . For the mutated genes identified through ICA, protein existence levels were manually assigned based on the UniProt data, including protein existence status, annotation score, similar proteins, and relevant publications.

    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > HymenopteraMine provides a report for each entity in the database. Each report is divided into sections including 'Summary', 'Gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Protein', 'Function', 'Homology', 'Others' or a subset of those categories, depending on the identifier searched. For example, searching a protein identifier would provide sections relevant to proteins. Each section of the report provides information in the form of a table that can be customized and downloaded in various formats. The Summary section of a Gene Report provides gene identifiers, symbols, description, organism, chromosome, strand and other identifiers such as aliases (identifiers from previous OGS versions) and database cross references. The Transcripts section provides information about the gene model (transcripts, exons, coding sequences) and gives a visual representation of the gene model highlighting the structure of the gene. Users can download FASTA-formatted sequences for each type of feature provided in the gene model section. Links are provided to JBrowse and to NCBI gene pages, when applicable. Transcript identifiers are linked to Transcript Reports, which include a Gene Expression section that provides raw read counts, normalized read counts, FPKM and RPKM values for RNAseq data with SRA metadata. The Protein section of the Gene Report includes protein name, accession and length. The protein name/accession numbers are linked to Protein Reports, with more information including protein family, GO annotations, InterPro domains, related publications, protein features, and curated notes from UniProt describing tissue specificity, function and developmental stages. The Function section provides GO annotation with evidence codes from the Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component ontologies. Clicking on the symbols to the right of each GO term leads to the directed acyclic graph showing all parents and children of the term, developed using the BioJS DAG Viewer (50). Clicking on a GO term provides a report for that term, a list of genes annotated with that term and tables showing relationships to other GO terms. The Homologue sec-tion lists homologues in other hymenopteran species and Drosophila melanogaster. The 'Other' section provides publications and a list of overlapping features.

Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.
    > The protein set for the HeLa spindle proteome is derived from the 1121 accession numbers in Sauer et al. supplementary table 1 column 2 [17]. Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.

    > The E. coli K-12 Reference Proteome and Data Sources-Two databases Uniprot (29) and EcoLOCATION (32) and the proposed IM proteome (33) were the main initial starting points for the complete subcellular categorization of K-12 described here. The E. coli K-12/ MG1655 strain is one of the microbial proteomes whose comprehensive annotation is of the highest priority in Uniprot (29). This is the "reference proteome" for E. coli, contains 4303 proteins, and has been annotated here. Our annotation has been formulated in such a way that it can be easily incorporated in Uniprot.
    > EchoLOCATION has an easily accessible table that maps gene names to subcellular locations. However, mapping the gene names given by EchoLOCATION to the respective protein identifiers in Uniprot was not straightforward. Unfortunately, gene names cannot serve as unique identifiers of a protein sequence. In more than 100 cases the gene name of a predicted protein in EchoLOCATION when searched against Uniprot gave as a result more than one K-12 protein hits. That is because there are proteins that have common synonymous gene names with the primary gene name of others.
    > To retrieve updated Uniprot accession identifiers and to map Uniprot accessions identifiers to EchoLOCATION identifiers (termed: EchoBASE IDs) we used the "ID mapping" function of Uniprot. In cases where the only provided identifiers were the gene names, we used mySQL queries to compare with the primary and alternative gene names in Uniprot. In cases where multiple matches existed for the same gene name, we manually resolved the differences based on other information (e.g. protein description, mass etc.).
    > The annotation of pseudogenes, mobile elements, transposons, and insertion elements relied on EcoGene (34), Uniprot (29), and Ochman et al. (35). The list of E. coli K-12 complexes was retrieved from EcoCyc (31) and literature searches.

    > One major concern regarding genome data is the potential spread of false or inaccurate functional annotations iterating by sequence similarity-based gene annotations where functions are ascribed by analogy to other organisms' genes rather than being experimentally verified. As the source of information on a putative gene function is not always clearly indicated in databases, we advise researchers to always trace the original literature related to a gene function to verify its plausibility in a given non-model organism.
    > A special case is the genes with no known functional annotation in model organisms, like the y-genes in E. coli (so named because their gene names begin with the letter y). Ghatak et al. (2019) used multiple databases to define the y-ome of E. coli as the 35% genes that lack experimental evidence of their function, and highlight the differences between genes that lack any known function and those with attributed localization or computationally annotated functional domains. A similar situation is observed with eukaryotic genomes, where a consistent fraction of about 20% of the genes remains with unknown (or unstudied) gene products. Wood et al. (2019) compared unknown gene products of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, S. cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens, and concluded that these genes remained understudied even since genome sequences were published. They disprove the common assumption that unknown gene products are mostly orphaned, as the majority are conserved from yeasts to humans, and they conclude that the reasons for the lack of research on these proteins is two-fold. For many of these genes, no apparent knockout phenotype was observed in standard conditions. On the other hand, researchers still focus on a few well-studied proteins rather than exploring unknown territories, which the authors partly ascribe to risk-adverse strategies of funders and reviewers.
    > Although the primary use of metabolic models is the analysis of already known metabolic pathways, the potential of metabolic models extends far beyond these analyses. They can be used to uncover hidden pathways, unknown reactions, and to construct de novo pathways.

To further enhance research utility, we integrated key functional annotations, including InterPro domains, UniProt similarity information, and expression patterns, into each gene entry (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 6B). We also developed a toolkit comprising BLAST, Annotator, ID converter, and Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment tools to facilitate rapid BLAST queries, gene domain and symbol annotation, DMv4 and DMv6 to DMv8 ID conversion, and functional enrichment analyses (Supplemental Figure 7). Together, this gene database enables researchers to retrieve comprehensive gene information and associated literature using either current gene symbols or legacy identifiers, significantly simplifying the background research process for functional gene studies and facilitating efficient project initiation.
    > To optimize user interaction with the Potato Knowledge Hub, we implemented an agentic task orchestration architecture and developed the Potato Research Assistant, an AI agent capable of invoking the workflows of the knowledge database, gene database, and integrated toolkit (Figure 1A). This agent interacts with users via natural language, conducts intent analysis, and calls the appropriate internal scripts to summarize potato research knowledge, retrieve gene information and sequences, and execute specific analytical tools. For a queried gene symbol, the assistant can summarize historical research, extract sequences (coding, protein, and customized promoter regions, etc.), and provide detailed information on putative gene function. By integrating these capabilities, the AI agent liberates users from tedious literature mining and complex bioinformatics software, enabling scientists without specialized computational expertise to efficiently explore and utilize a tremendous amount of gene information with ease.
    > To evaluate the performance of the Potato Research Assistant, in addition to the 70 questions used to benchmark the knowledge base, we collected an additional 20 questions focused on gene understanding and 10 questions related to sequence extraction to assess the gene database.

To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > functionally annotate these genes. Fourteen of the 27 upregulated genes could be annotated (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, the  annotation showed a clear enrichment of genes involved in translation. Of the 14 annotated genes five were aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and two eukaryotic translation initiation factors (see also below). The biological consequence of this response is not clear but possibly the translational activity of the host is increased during infection. A common challenge faced by the researchers is to translate lists of differentially regulated genes into a better understanding of the underlying biological phenomena. This can be accomplished by the translation of the list of differentially regulated genes into a functional profile that is able to provide insight into the cellular mechanisms relevant in the given condition. The gene ontology (GO; http://www.geneontology.org/) project is an effort to produce a system for annotating gene products that can be applied across all organisms. GO is divided into three categories describing molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components (Harris et al., 2004). A complete list of all Dictyostelium proteins with GO annotations is available from the GO website (http://www. geneontology.org/GO.current.annotations.shtml).
    > We selected those genes of the array (reference list) and of the four major clusters in Fig. 3A (gene lists) whose gene products have GO annotations. To identify statistically sig-nificant enriched GO terms in our gene lists as compared with the reference list we used the program GOAT (Xu and Shaulsky, 2005). The hypothesis is that likewise regulated genes might belong to identical or similar pathways or are affected by the same cause. Given a gene and a reference list, the GOAT program calculates the enrichment and statistical significance of every GO term by comparing the observed number of genes in a specific category with the number of genes that might appear in the same category if a selection performed from the same reference list were completely random. Enriched biological process and molecular function GO terms of groups 1 and 4 that are characterized by mainly downregulated genes are listed in Table 3 and those of groups 2 and 3 that contain mainly upregulated genes in Table 4.
