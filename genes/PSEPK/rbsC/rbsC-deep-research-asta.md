## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88K36
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=D-ribose ABC transporter-permease subunit {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68068.1}; EC=3.6.3.17 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68068.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=rbsC {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68068.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_2456 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN68068.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport system
- **Key Domains:** ABC_transp_permease. (IPR001851); BPD_transp_2 (PF02653)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "rbsC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'rbsC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **rbsC** (gene ID: rbsC, UniProt: Q88K36) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > However, the peaks were in different positions within the gene in the four individual experiments performed (Fig. 6), and no specific binding site within the mRNA could be identified from the data.
    > Among the genes identified were numerous genes related to protein biosynthesis (tRNAs, tRNA-aminoacyl synthetases, tRNA-modifying enzymes, ribosomal proteins). As an example, genes for ribosomal proteins were highly represented with 18 out of the 22 genes (82%) for small ribosomal proteins, (12 after cold shock, 55%), and 31 out of 34 genes (91%) for large ribosomal subunit proteins (22 after cold shock, 65%). Other protein families represented were chaperones (e.g., dnaK, dnaJ, grpE, but not dafA, groES, groEL, clpB), cold-shock and general stress proteins (TT_RS08235, _09210; hsp22, hsp30; uspA), topoisomerase genes (gyrA, gyrB, topA), genes for transporters and their subunits (often both the gene for the substrate-bind-ing protein and for the permease, for example, branchedchain amino acid ABC transporter, TT_RS01115 and _01120), and genes related to sugar-and cell wall metabolism and cell division, as well as CRISPR-related genes. In many cases, genes for all subunits of protein complexes (e.g., genes for cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II; clpA, clpX coding for the ClpAX protease) were present.
    > A systematic gene ontology analysis using the DAVID server 6.7 (https://david-d.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) (Huang da et al. 2009a,b) with the consolidated gene lists for Hera1/Hera2, and Hera3/Hera4, translated into UniProt accession numbers, revealed three annotation clusters with significant enrichment (Supplemental Table 4a,b).

This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Sequence similarity analyses were accomplished using blastx [26] against the NCBI non-redundant database on protein level [32], the Swissprot database [33,34] and KEGG [35]. Additionally, manual gene annotation was performed using PRIAM [36], Motif Scan [37], Prosite  [38], BRENDA [39,40], UniProt/SwissProt [34], Inter-ProScan [41], and Pfam [42] databases. One example of how our manual annotation differed from that of the automated pipeline used by Brown et al. can be found in the case of CLAU_3519 (CAETHG_3609). Here the automated pipeline from the Brown et al. finished genome assigned this gene product as a hypothetical protein, however when the sequence was aligned using BLASTP as part of our manual curation all other proteins with >75 % identity were named sodium ABC transporter. Upon further inspection in Pfam, one large ABC-2 family transporter protein domain was found (E-value 6.8e-31). Similar searches of UniProt and KEGG databases agreed with Pfam, therefore we annotated this gene product as an ABC-2 family transporter. The correction of the previously short-called homopolymer reads through our sequencing efforts gave a fully annotated finished sequence of C. autoethanogenum without the erroneous frame-shift containing annotations which had occurred previously. Using these tools we were able to manually curate the entire genome to ensure that the automated annotation was correct and to insert additional information where required, as well as implementing a standardised protein product naming system as recommend by the NCBI guidelines [43] for ease of identification of genes with related functions. As a consequence of the automated and subsequent manual curation, we have found 482 instances across the genome where genes previously identified as 'hypothetical protein' have either been assigned a specific function, or have been named through identification of conserved domains based on sequence similarity.

    > The BLASTx homology search tool, a component of the standalone NCBI-blast-2.3.0+, was used to perform functional annotation of the F. udum genes (Altschul et al., 1990). With a cut-off E value of ≤1e−06 and a similarity of 34%, BLASTx identified the homologous sequences of the genes in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using Blast2GO PRO 4.1.5 (Conesa and Gotz, 2008). In three different mappings, B2G performed as follows: (1) Using two NCBI-provided mapping files, blast result accessions are used to get gene names (symbols; gene info, gene 2 accessions). (2) Blast result GI identifiers were used to retrieve UniProt IDs using a mapping file from PIR (non-redundant reference protein database), which includes PSD, Swiss-Prot, UniProt, TrEMBL, GenPept, RefSeq, and PDB. The names of the identified genes were searched in the species-specific entries of the gene product table of the GO database. With the aid of the KAAS-KEGG Automatic Annotation Server, pathway analyses were carried out. This database provides functional annotation of genes using other data servers (Moriya et al., 2007). Accessions from the blast results were looked for in the DBXRef table of the GO database.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions.

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

- Summary: It is found that evolution in response to extreme feast/famine is characterized by narrow adaptive trajectories with high mutational parallelism and notable mutational order, which demonstrate how microbes can navigate the adaptive landscapes of regularly fluctuating conditions and ultimately follow mutational trajectories that confer benefits across diverse environments.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Many public databases of gene information are available (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16). However, different public databases often use different sets of unique identifiers (IDs) to describe the same genes or homologous genes in different species. One challenge of comparing large-scale biological datasets is the unification of gene names; otherwise, researchers spend a lot of effort in converting gene IDs when searching different databases. Another is the likelihood of missing some databases due to unfamiliarity; this is particularly true for clinicians and researchers who are specialized in inner ear research but are not necessarily familiar with genomics and bioinformatics. One goal of the SHIELD is to integrate relevant gene annotation information from various public databases in one centralized location.
    > For the SHIELD, annotations were derived from public databases and literature. Currently implemented annotations include official gene symbols, description of the gene name and synonyms, human and mouse chromosome cytogenetic banding, RefSeq RNA and protein (for protein coding genes) accession numbers, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez gene ID, genomic coordinates in both mouse reference genome assemblies mm9 and mm10, Ensembl, the Vertebrate Genome Annotation Database (VEGA) Mouse Genome Informatics, UniProt, Online Mendalian Inheritance in Man and gene ontology.
    > For each protein coding genes, we display all UniProt protein isoforms for that gene, the length in amino acid residues and the predicted number of transmembrane domains (TMs). We predicted TMs by running TMHMM2.0 run on all UniProt protein isoforms of each gene (17). The number of TMs is of special interest for research in sensory function, because many key proteins involved in signaling-such as the mechanotransduction ion channels-are integral membrane proteins. This information would help identify candidate genes for the components of the mechanotransduction apparatus of the inner ear.
    > We also performed manual curation of inner ear disorders including syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss according to the Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org) and primary literature.

    > Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 5.3 449 by MS, the presence of only one TM segment leaves a chance for a false annotation by the prediction software. 3) Also the gene identification software may have falsely predicted coding sequences or the proteins may be expressed at a low level, preventing an identification and functional assignment.
    > To benchmark the capability of our new analysis method and to check for the absence or presence of membrane proteins, we chose ABC transporters as model compounds that contain at least one integral membrane and one soluble subunit. For eight tripartite or tetrapartite ABC transporters, at least three subunits were found, and for 13 tripartite or dipartite transporters, at least two subunits were found. In five cases the permease subunit was not identified, and in two cases the periplasmic component was not identified, whereas the ATPase subunit was detected for all 13 proteins. In conclusion, the membrane-intrinsic permease subunits of ABC transporters appear to be more difficult to detect than their soluble interaction partners. Similarly a previous proteome study of Halobacterium salinarum reports an even more obvious underrepresentation of permease subunits (6). Among the ABC proteins with two or three identified subunits are the glutamate permease (Glu), the ABC type phosphate transport system (Pts), the sn-glycerol 3-phosphate transport system (Ugp), and transporters for which the exact substrate is unknown such as metal, sugar, multidrug, and dipeptide/oligopeptide/nickel transporters. For eight multisubunit ABC transporters none of the subunits could be found. Nevertheless the total number of identified ABC transporters was rather high, suggesting that the majority are expressed under the cultivation conditions. Other experiments are required to quantify these various ABC transporters. Additional transporters that could be identified under these conditions include the lysine exporter; the phosphotransferase systems for glucose, fructose, sucrose, and UDP-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide; the maltose permease; and the low affinity ammonium transporter AmtB.

    > Gene SSU_RS04755 has been predicted to encode a basic membrane family protein (BMP), a transmembrane component of specific ABC transporters. Growth curve experiments did not reveal a significant reduction in the growth rate of our ΔSSU_RS04755 mutant. The operon genes with SSU_RS04755 were predicted to encode an ATPbinding protein and a permease which are typical components of an ABC transporter. Both predicted ATPbinding protein and permease encoding genes appeared as CEGs in our Tn-seq results (Table 1). The protein sequence associated with SSU_RS04755 shares significant identity with lipoproteins that are components of nucleoside ABC transporters in Gram-positive bacteria (see above), suggesting that SSU_RS04755 and its operon genes may encode an ABC transporter complex involved in nucleoside transport. To investigate the possible functional equivalence of SSU_RS04755 operon genes with ABC transporters, we performed amino acid sequence alignments of SSU_RS04755 with PnrA and TmpC, which are homologous nucleoside binding lipoproteins from S. pneumoniae and Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) respectively [49,50]. Using the crystal structure of PnrA binding to adenosine [49], we confirmed that all but one (T70) of the specific amino acids involved in adenosine binding by PnrA were conserved in SSU_RS04755 (Figure 5(c)).
    > To verify if the structural positions of these amino acids were conserved, we performed a structural prediction (see methods) of the predicted S. suis lipoprotein SSU_RS04755 and aligned it to the structure of PnrA (ID 6y9U in Protein Data Bank (PDB). We confirmed that all amino acids involved in the adenosine binding are located at the same position in both protein structures.

    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > Gene nomenclature contains current official symbols and various numbers of synonyms, which pose a challenge to integrating genomic data and increase the probability that different genes share the same symbol. Therefore, we retrieved identifiers assigned to all protein-coding genes in human, mouse, rat and pig genomes that are available in the Ensembl genome browser (release 113) to assess the number of genes, compare species and identify ambiguous symbols. Results: Our analysis revealed that the total number of symbols, both official symbols and synonyms, used to identify protein-coding genes ranges from 16,600 in pigs to 64,580 in mice. Furthermore, the gene nomenclature is not complete because there are also genes without an assigned symbol, which indicates gaps in understanding protein-coding genes, especially in pigs. We also found a large number of gene symbols that map to more than one gene. These symbols might complicate the identification of about 10% of rat and mouse genes and 18% of human protein-coding genes. A simple solution for this problem is the usage of stable gene IDs assigned by scientific institutions and committees (Ensembl, NCBI, RGD, HGNC and VGNC) provided that the genomic information associated with these IDs is retrieved directly from proprietary databases containing the most accurate data. Finally, although gene symbols may pose a problem with unequivocal identification of genes, there are instances when no other identifiers are available in the literature. Therefore, we have developed an R script performing search of the Ensembl database and integrating data to provide a single list of updated symbols with annotation about their ambiguity. Conclusions: Gene symbols are not always reliable and should be reported together with stable IDs to enable unequivocal identification of genes. Therefore, data containing only gene symbols should be used cautiously to avoid misidentification of genes. A solution for this problem is our R script REgeness that performs a gene symbol update to current official versions combined with identification of ambiguous symbols and retrieval of other IDs from the Ensembl database.
