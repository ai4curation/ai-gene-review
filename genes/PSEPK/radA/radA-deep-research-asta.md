## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88E24
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=DNA repair protein RadA {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01498, ECO:0000256|NCBIfam:TIGR00416};
- **Gene Information:** Name=radA {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01498, ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70217.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_4644 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70217.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the RecA family. RadA subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** AAA+_ATPase. (IPR003593); DNA_repair_RadA. (IPR004504); P-loop_NTPase. (IPR027417); RecA_ATP-bd. (IPR020588); Ribosomal_Su5_D2-typ_SF. (IPR020568)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "radA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'radA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **radA** (gene ID: radA, UniProt: Q88E24) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.743)
    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > CellPhoneDB stores ligand-receptor interactions, as well as other properties of the interacting partners, including their subunit architecture and gene and protein identifiers. To create the content of the database, four main .csv data files are required: gene_input.csv, protein_input.csv, complex_input.csv and interaction_input.csv (Fig. 4).
    > gene_input Mandatory fields are 'gene_name', 'uniprot', 'hgnc_symbol' and 'ensembl'. This file is critical for establishing the link between the scRNA-seq data and the interaction pairs stored at the protein level. It includes the following gene and protein identifiers: (i) gene name ('gene_name'), (ii) UniProt identifier ('uniprot'), (iii) HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbol ('hgnc_symbol') and (iv) gene Ensembl identifier (ENSG) ('ensembl'). To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.722)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > The NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), include protein sequence information from GenBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), SwissProt, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and Protein Research Foundation (PRF). The NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) are the nucleotide sequence database that includes nucleotide sequence from GenBank of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as cell, organism and ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. KEGG is an established Cluster of Orthologous (KO) annotation system that can accomplish the function annotation of the genome/transcriptome of a newly sequenced species. SwissProt is a manual annotated and reviewed protein sequence database that has a high-quality protein sequence database from experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions. Pfam is comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile of hidden Markov models. Many proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of a specific structural domain possesses a certain degree of conservative property. GO is the established standard for the functional annotation of gene products and controlled vocabulary used to classify the functional attributes of gene products of a biological process, a molecular function and a cellular component.

    > In a basic workflow, the GOnet application receives a list of gene symbols, protein symbols, or protein IDs (UniProt IDs) as an input, and outputs a graph (an example given in Fig. 1). There are various input parameters which will affect the actual structure of the graph visualized and its appearance. The first main user choice is which GO terms the genes are annotated against:
    > 1. GO terms statistically significantly over-represented in the gene list submitted. 2. A predefined subset (also known as 'GO slim'), or a user-supplied list of terms.
    > In the first case the analysis will be referred to as an 'enrichment' analysis, in the second as an 'annotation' analysis.
    > Input parameters 1) Gene list. A mandatory input parameter containing the genes/proteins of interest. Currently human and mouse data is supported. An example of a human gene list might look like this:
    > Fig. 1 Sample network output generated by GOnet application. Gene differentially expressed in CD4 Bulk Memory T cells in Latent TB patients compared to healthy controls were used as an example [22] The gene list can also be accompanied with a contrast value. For example, This contrast value can be any decimal number, such as the log-fold change of gene expression between two conditions. This is merely a visualization enhancement. If the value is supplied it can be used later to differentially color specific genes in the graph (note different colors of gene nodes in Fig. 1), and visually indicate up-or down-regulation of specific genes and gene clusters.
    > The application can process common gene symbols (like in the example above), UniProt IDs, and MGI Accession IDs (mouse only). The former type of ID (gene symbols), although is the most human friendly, can unfortunately be ambiguous. For example, AIM1 can mean 'absent in melanoma' (also called CRYBG1) or 'Aurora and Ipl1-like midbody-associated protein' (also known as AURKB). Due to this ambiguity UniProt IDs or MGI accession IDs (for mouse) are preferred.
    > 2) GO namespace. Can be any of 'biological process', 'molecular function' or 'cellular component'.

Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > Correspondence gene symbols associated with their respective source publications. To further enhance research utility, we integrated key functional annotations, including InterPro domains, UniProt similarity information, and expression patterns, into each gene entry (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 6B). We also developed a toolkit comprising BLAST, Annotator, ID converter, and Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment tools to facilitate rapid BLAST queries, gene domain and symbol annotation, DMv4 and DMv6 to DMv8 ID conversion, and functional enrichment analyses (Supplemental Figure 7). Together, this gene database enables researchers to retrieve comprehensive gene information and associated literature using either current gene symbols or legacy identifiers, significantly simplifying the background research process for functional gene studies and facilitating efficient project initiation.
    > To optimize user interaction with the Potato Knowledge Hub, we implemented an agentic task orchestration architecture and developed the Potato Research Assistant, an AI agent capable of invoking the workflows of the knowledge database, gene database, and integrated toolkit (Figure 1A). This agent interacts with users via natural language, conducts intent analysis, and calls the appropriate internal scripts to summarize potato research knowledge, retrieve gene information and sequences, and execute specific analytical tools. For a queried gene symbol, the assistant can summarize historical research, extract sequences (coding, protein, and customized promoter regions, etc.), and provide detailed information on putative gene function. By integrating these capabilities, the AI agent liberates users from tedious literature mining and complex bioinformatics software, enabling scientists without specialized computational expertise to efficiently explore and utilize a tremendous amount of gene information with ease.
    > To evaluate the performance of the Potato Research Assistant, in addition to the 70 questions used to benchmark the knowledge base, we collected an additional 20 questions focused on gene understanding and 10 questions related to sequence extraction to assess the gene database.

    > Because the retrieved targets may have irregular names or contain proteins or genes from different species, the target information needs to be standardized after each step of target collection. The specific methods are as follows: use uniprotkb search function in UniProt database, input protein name and define the species as human (Homo sapiens), correct all the retrieved proteins to their official names (official symbols) and extract the standard gene names, and obtain the correct target information through database retrieval and transformation (Shaik et al. 2016).

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > Although this is a fairly obvious requirement, it is not trivial to implement because a protein reagent expressed recombinantly is typically not the exact same entity or in the same state as its corresponding assay participant in a living cell (e.g., kinase domain binding assay vs. corresponding kinase occurring in a specific cell line used for a growth inhibition assay). In this first version of metadata standards, we take a rudimentary approach. We use the UniProt accession and approved Gene symbol (NCBI Gene) and accession number to identify and reference proteins and their coding genes, respectively. Although we recognize limitations, for the purpose of our current simple use cases, this is sufficient. Linking protein and gene identifiers in addition is relevant to integrate RNAi reagent gene targets (see below). The recommended explicit fields for proteins include a standardized name, both for the protein and the gene that encodes it; source of protein (e.g., chemically synthesized, purified from natural source, recombinantly expressed); protein modifications (e.g., mutations, posttranslational modification); protein purity; subunit information for components of a protein complex; and isoform information (derived from either alternative promoter usage, alternative splicing, alternative translation initiation, or frame shifting). We are currently working on a formal description of proteins that will allow ambiguity (more-or less-specific definition of proteins), because in some cases, the exact entity and state of a protein reagent or model system participant is not definitively known (full length, functional domain, exact sequence, mutation, phosphorylation state, etc.).
    > Inhibitory RNAs (siRNA, shRNA). RNA interference is a standard methodology to transiently knock down gene expression in living cells. This can be achieved using different types of small RNA molecules, including siRNA, shRNA, and miRNA. Information that is relevant to identify and describe these perturbations include probe ID, name, source/provider, target gene symbol and accession number, sequence of the probe, and modifications to the probe (e.g., chemical modification) if any are specified.

UniProt provides extensive data on proteins and their functional annotations 19 . The KRAS gene encoding GTPase protein consisting of 189 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 21.6 kDa was recovered from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the RCSB-PDB ID: 7SCW, which has a resolution of 1.98 Å. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) ( https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7SCW/pdb) is a crucial resource for studying the 3D structures, aiding research and education in many fields 20 .
