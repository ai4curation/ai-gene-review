## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88EJ1
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Magnesium transporter MgtE {ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU362011};
- **Gene Information:** Name=mgtE {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70046.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_4471 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN70046.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SLC41A transporter family.
- **Key Domains:** CBS_dom. (IPR000644); CBS_dom_sf. (IPR046342); Mg_transptr_MgtE_intracell_dom. (IPR006668); MgtE_N_sf. (IPR038076); MgtE_transporter. (IPR006669)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "mgtE" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'mgtE' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **mgtE** (gene ID: mgtE, UniProt: Q88EJ1) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.754)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > The lists of proteins used for the comparison contain more items than listed previously due to expansion out of gene clusters, for example, to allow the updating and comparison of current HGNC gene symbols. These lists of proteins were compared in Microsoft Excel 2011 using PivotTable.
    > The protein set for the CHO midbody was derived from the accession numbers in Table S1 and Table S2 from Skop et al. [9]. Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.
    > The protein set for the HeLa spindle proteome is derived from the 1121 accession numbers in Sauer et al. supplementary table 1 column 2 [17]. Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > Sequence similarity analyses were accomplished using blastx [26] against the NCBI non-redundant database on protein level [32], the Swissprot database [33,34] and KEGG [35]. Additionally, manual gene annotation was performed using PRIAM [36], Motif Scan [37], Prosite  [38], BRENDA [39,40], UniProt/SwissProt [34], Inter-ProScan [41], and Pfam [42] databases. One example of how our manual annotation differed from that of the automated pipeline used by Brown et al. can be found in the case of CLAU_3519 (CAETHG_3609). Here the automated pipeline from the Brown et al. finished genome assigned this gene product as a hypothetical protein, however when the sequence was aligned using BLASTP as part of our manual curation all other proteins with >75 % identity were named sodium ABC transporter. Upon further inspection in Pfam, one large ABC-2 family transporter protein domain was found (E-value 6.8e-31). Similar searches of UniProt and KEGG databases agreed with Pfam, therefore we annotated this gene product as an ABC-2 family transporter. The correction of the previously short-called homopolymer reads through our sequencing efforts gave a fully annotated finished sequence of C. autoethanogenum without the erroneous frame-shift containing annotations which had occurred previously. Using these tools we were able to manually curate the entire genome to ensure that the automated annotation was correct and to insert additional information where required, as well as implementing a standardised protein product naming system as recommend by the NCBI guidelines [43] for ease of identification of genes with related functions. As a consequence of the automated and subsequent manual curation, we have found 482 instances across the genome where genes previously identified as 'hypothetical protein' have either been assigned a specific function, or have been named through identification of conserved domains based on sequence similarity.

    > The study provides a detailed overview of Ensembl protein-coding genes and explains relationships between various gene identifiers assigned by Ensembl, NCBI and specialized committees such as MGI, RGD, HGNC and VGNC (Table 2). The most important finding is that a large number of gene symbols in the most frequently studied species, laboratory rodents and humans, can map to more than one gene, either via the official gene symbol or via a synonym (Fig. 4). Symbols that map to more than one gene may lead to confusion in 10% of rat and mouse genes and 18% of human genes, as indicated by the estimate based on the protein-coding genes in the Ensembl database (Fig. 4).
    > Our results also indicated that the impact of the symbol ambiguity is even larger after inclusion of other types of genes. Therefore, it constitutes much more severe problem than previously reported transformations of some gene symbols caused by Excel [1][2][3][4]. The misidentifications caused by symbol ambiguity are most likely in case of literature data retrieved from older studies using past versions of gene nomenclature with a large number of obsolete symbols. A simple solution for this problem is to use stable gene IDs (Table 2) for unequivocal identification of genes. Gene symbols derived from abbreviated full gene names are convenient because they convey functional meaning and can be easily memorized while the stable IDs enable disambiguation of gene nomenclature. Therefore, reporting both gene symbols and stable IDs is a best solution combining advantages of different naming systems.
    > It is important, however, to retrieve genomic information associated with gene identifiers directly from proprietary databases hosted by organizations responsible for the assignment of these IDs. Such proprietary databases contain the most accurate data that are not affected by a delayed exchange of information between databases due to different time schedules of data updates. Furthermore, genomic databases are not fully compatible due to differences in genome annotation caused by the usage of different raw sequence data, different methodology and unusual complexity of some loci that cannot be easily fitted in the canonical view of a gene [36]. The existence of such discrepancies is another reason for using proprietary databases for each type of gene identifiers (Table 2).
  - Snippet 2 (score: 0.707)
    > Gene nomenclature contains current official symbols and various numbers of synonyms, which pose a challenge to integrating genomic data and increase the probability that different genes share the same symbol. Therefore, we retrieved identifiers assigned to all protein-coding genes in human, mouse, rat and pig genomes that are available in the Ensembl genome browser (release 113) to assess the number of genes, compare species and identify ambiguous symbols. Results: Our analysis revealed that the total number of symbols, both official symbols and synonyms, used to identify protein-coding genes ranges from 16,600 in pigs to 64,580 in mice. Furthermore, the gene nomenclature is not complete because there are also genes without an assigned symbol, which indicates gaps in understanding protein-coding genes, especially in pigs. We also found a large number of gene symbols that map to more than one gene. These symbols might complicate the identification of about 10% of rat and mouse genes and 18% of human protein-coding genes. A simple solution for this problem is the usage of stable gene IDs assigned by scientific institutions and committees (Ensembl, NCBI, RGD, HGNC and VGNC) provided that the genomic information associated with these IDs is retrieved directly from proprietary databases containing the most accurate data. Finally, although gene symbols may pose a problem with unequivocal identification of genes, there are instances when no other identifiers are available in the literature. Therefore, we have developed an R script performing search of the Ensembl database and integrating data to provide a single list of updated symbols with annotation about their ambiguity. Conclusions: Gene symbols are not always reliable and should be reported together with stable IDs to enable unequivocal identification of genes. Therefore, data containing only gene symbols should be used cautiously to avoid misidentification of genes. A solution for this problem is our R script REgeness that performs a gene symbol update to current official versions combined with identification of ambiguous symbols and retrieval of other IDs from the Ensembl database.

    > Genes overrepresented for nonsynonymous and structural mutations were classified into functional groups based on the functional annotation table constructed with DAVID v.2023q3 91,92 (Table S4). We established the following rules for generalizing genes into functional groups: Chaperone: genes that encode proteins that perform chaperone or chaperonin-like activities (Uniprot Keyword: KW-0143); Envelope: Genes that encode proteins involved in the maintenance of the cell-envelope such as phospholipid biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0008654) and peptidoglycan biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0000270); Metabolism: Genes that encode proteins involved in general metabolic functions, such as purine metabolism (KEGG: eco00230), amino acid metabolism (KEGG: eco00470, eco00330); or TCA Cycle (KEGG: eco00020); Regulators: Genes that encode proteins directly involved in transcription (GO-BP: 0031564; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0804), translation (GO-BP:0006412, GO-BP:0006413; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0689), or the regulation of transcription (GO-BP: 0006355, GO-BP:2000143, GO-BP:0006353, GO-BP: GO:0045893; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0805); and Transport: Genes that encode proteins involved in transport: such as ABC transporters (Interpro: PR017871), MFS transporters (Interpro: IPR011701); symporters (Interpro: IPR023954, IPR001204, IPR001734, IPR023025, IPR004840), or Antiporters (Interpro: IPR004771). A combination of resources were used to determine if a parallel mutation arose in a functional region of a protein including, EcoCyc, 96 UniProt, 97 and the primary literature (see supplemental bibliography).

    > CellPhoneDB stores ligand-receptor interactions, as well as other properties of the interacting partners, including their subunit architecture and gene and protein identifiers. To create the content of the database, four main .csv data files are required: gene_input.csv, protein_input.csv, complex_input.csv and interaction_input.csv (Fig. 4).
    > gene_input Mandatory fields are 'gene_name', 'uniprot', 'hgnc_symbol' and 'ensembl'. This file is critical for establishing the link between the scRNA-seq data and the interaction pairs stored at the protein level. It includes the following gene and protein identifiers: (i) gene name ('gene_name'), (ii) UniProt identifier ('uniprot'), (iii) HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbol ('hgnc_symbol') and (iv) gene Ensembl identifier (ENSG) ('ensembl'). To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > In order to identify enzymes among glycolytic interactors, we used the EC number in the Uniprot reference proteome [34]. Similarly, we used the Uniprot GO (Gene Ontology) terms to map proteins to biological processes, including "metabolic process" to find metabolic proteins or proteins not known to be involved in any metabolic pathway. This information was verified using annotations from KEGG [35] to identify proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism or other processes, such as environmental information processing. Lastly, we identified essential genes/proteins using the Database of Essential Genes (DEG version 15.2) [36].

    > Case 2: From proteins to genes When working with protein interaction networks, for example those from the STRING database (see http:// apps.cytoscape.org/apps/stringapp), you may want to translate protein identifiers (e.g., Uniprot-TrEMBL) to gene identifiers. The idmapper app supports this case as well, but one should be aware of the assumptions involved when making this translation. Since most genes encode for many proteins, you may have many-to-one mappings in your results. For all human networks imported from STRING using the StringApp 5 , the following commands will perform an ID mapping from Uniprot-TrEMBL (proteins) to Ensembl (genes):
    > (RCy3): mapTableColumn(column="canonical name", species="Human", map.from="Uniprot-TrEMBL", map.to="Ensembl") (py2cytoscape): cyclient.idmapper.map_column(source_column="canonical name", species="Human", source_selection="Uniprot-TrEMBL", target_selection="Ensembl")
    > Case 3: Identifiers and symbols In contrast to gene names and symbols, identifiers provide a more reliable means of specifying a particular gene.
    > All data integration should be performed using identifiers as keys. Nevertheless, names and symbols play an important role in making results easier to read and understand. The idmapper app is primarily concerned with identifiers. However, relying on a subset of commonly used sources from BridgeDb (Table 1) it does provide one exception.

Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > Recorded for each protein of the mass spectrometry data sets were, where available, the original protein identifier, subcellular location, sequence of identified peptides, sequence coverage, and the experimental techniques that had been used for the purification, separation, and identification of the protein. If the original protein identifier could not be mapped to a UniProt primary accession number by PIR ID or MGI, then the protein was compared with proteins in UniProt by using BLASTP (14). If there was a significant match, then the UniProt primary accession number was assigned to the protein. Those proteins without a significant match were discarded. By using the PIR ID and the MGI identifier conversion tools, the evidence of mitochondrial localization for a protein was linked to many of the UniProt entries representing it. Identifiers of proteins encoded in the mitochondrial genome of organisms were taken from the Organelle database of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute and used to annotate the appropriate proteins in MitoMiner.
    > The source of protein sequences, related features, and annotation was UniProt (11). All UniProt entries were downloaded for the six species with mitochondrial localization data sets. The literature citations in each UniProt entry were retrieved from PubMed by using an InterMine parser. Additional Gene Ontology annotation on the biological process, metabolic function, and cellular component of each protein was taken from UniProt (15) and individual genome projects of M. musculus (12), Rattus norvegicus (16), Drosophila melanogaster (17), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (18).
    > Finally lists of human genes and the descriptions of their associated disease phenotypes were taken from OMIM (19), the definitions of groups of homologous proteins were taken from HomoloGene (20), and data on the reactions, enzymes, and compounds of metabolic pathways were taken from KEGG (21). The EC numbers of proteins in UniProt were used to define the cross-reference between proteins and metabolic pathways.

For example, for the human genome GeneSet2miRNA supports identifiers from 'Entrez Gene' (24), 'UniProt/Swiss-Prot', 'Gene Symbol' (24,25), 'UniGene' (24), 'Ensembl' (26), 'RefSeq Protein ID', 'RefSeq Transcript ID' ( 27) and 'Affymetrix probe codes' (28). Additionally a mixture of several identifier types is possible. In the first step user supplied gene Ids are mapped to 'Entrez Gene' identifiers. For this purpose files from NCBI and Affymetrix web sites are used. Detailed information on data sources used by GeneSet2miRNA is in Table 1.
    > The user gets full information on the mapping of the supplied gene ids. We would like to point out that protein and gene identifiers can be highly ambiguous (29) with multiple synonymous variants. For this reason the quality of the retrieved annotation can be different for different types of identifiers. To escape multiple mapping issues we recommend submitting 'Entrez Gene' identifies to GeneSet2miRNA.
