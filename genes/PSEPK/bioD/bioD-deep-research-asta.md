## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88QW8
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=ATP-dependent dethiobiotin synthetase BioD {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00336}; EC=6.3.3.3 {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00336}; AltName: Full=DTB synthetase {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00336}; Short=DTBS {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00336}; AltName: Full=Dethiobiotin synthase {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00336};
- **Gene Information:** Name=bioD {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00336, ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN65997.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_0366 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN65997.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the dethiobiotin synthetase family.
- **Key Domains:** DTB_synth_BioD. (IPR004472); P-loop_NTPase. (IPR027417); AAA_26 (PF13500)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "bioD" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'bioD' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **bioD** (gene ID: bioD, UniProt: Q88QW8) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.688)
    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > All human IDs used for data annotation were downloaded from Uniprot 20 FTP (URL: ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledge-base/ idmapping/by_organism/, Version: 10/03/2016). The resulting data provided 133,996 unique identifications, which were in turn used to query the Uniprot database. This search returned HHMI Author Manuscript HHMI Author Manuscript HHMI Author Manuscript 109,961 records (including reviewed and unreviewed) along with their functional and structural annotations, including gene ontology features. The annotation table was used to search for mitochondrial evidence associated with a given Uniprot identification in our proximity-labeling anti-biotin-enriched data set by using a string match algorithm. A given protein was annotated as having mitochondrial evidence if any of the following were true: (i) the string 'mitoch' matched the above UniProt annotation table when queried by either gene name or accession number. (ii) The protein showed mitochondrial evidence from a list of mitochondrial proteins which was the same as our previous study (Rhee et al. 11 ) and a precursor to MitoCarta2.0 catalog 28 . (iii) The protein was present in the original mitochondrial true positive list used Rhee et al. 11 . Thebiotinylated peptide data were filtered such that reverse hits, nonhuman contaminants, nonfully localized biotinylation sites, sites identified in the SILAC light state, and redundant biotin site entries were removed. From this list, transmembrane proteins were annotated using the following criteria: (i) the UniProt transmembrane annotation contains the string "TRANSMEM" when matched by either gene name or accession number and/or (ii) evidence from of transmembrane domains after running the precursor MitoCarta2.0 catalog through TMHMM 29 . The UniProt topological domain annotation contained the string "TOPO" when matched by either gene name or accession number.

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.668)
    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > The database enables searching by gene symbols/names, GenBank accession numbers, UniGene cluster IDs, Swiss-Prot entry names and several unique clone IDs (IMAGE clone IDs, University of Iowa clone IDs, Operon oligo IDs, TAIR IDs and a subset of selected Affymetrix and Agilent IDs).
    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

- Summary: A comprehensive protein localization analysis of essential genes in 27 prokaryotes including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and 1 archaeon has been performed and shows that proteins encoded by essential genes are enriched in internal location sites, while exist in cell envelope with a lower proportion compared with non-essential ones.

    > Bioinformatics Databases. DEG is a database of essential genes (http://www. essentialgene.org/). The newly released DEG 10 has been developed to accommodate the quantitative and qualitative advancements brought by the progressive identification methods. Currently available records of both essential and nonessential genes among a wide range of organisms can be downloaded from DEG 10, making it possible to compare the two different types of genes in many aspects 21 .
    > 27 prokaryotic organisms including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and Methanococcus maripaludis S2, the only record of the Archaea domain were selected to analyze the protein localization and GO distribution of the essential and nonessential genes. There are 31 bacterial records corresponding to 27 organisms in the database in total and 26 sets of data were selected in the current study. Streptococcus pneumonia was not chosen for the lack of non-essential genes. Since the essential genes were not genome-widely identified, it's not reasonable to regard the complementary set of essential genes as non-essential genes in Streptococcus pneumonia 29,30 . In the case of multiple records for one organism, the one with the most convincing experimental methods was chosen. The non-essential genes in Methanococcus maripaludis S2 and 13 bacteria such as Escherichia coli MG1655 are obtained based on the original literatures, while non-essential genes in other 12 organisms such as Bacillus subtilis 168 are the complementary set of essential genes. The information of the organisms used in the current study are displayed in Table 1.
    > The three model genomes' subcellular location information and the Gene Ontology (GO) terms used for the analysis in the current study were downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt; http://www.uniprot.org). Maintained by the UniProt Consortium, UniProt is committed to providing biologists with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and functional annotation 27 . Among the wealth of annotation data, detailed GO annotation statements are included.

    > Labelling of such a gene as "inactivated" seems biologically correct. This is translated to the CDS qualifier /pseudo in EMBL and securely ensures that the protein translation is not present in UniProt (e.g., searching for OE_1059R results in no hit). When, however, an invalid partial translation product is produced but not tagged as disrupted (as is the case for VNG0034H), then this is considered by EMBL as a "regular" gene (CDS). Such a gene fragment is included as a regular protein in UniProt (VNG0034H is Q9HSX6). Upon superficial analysis, this may be taken as evidence for an "improved" (because less incomplete) genome annotation in strain NRC-1 compared to strain R1. In addition, according to EMBL requirements, the "CDS" coordinates of OE_1059R must be given as 29913-31570, thus covering and including the integrated transposon ISH1 (with its transposase gene). Only a "tolerated" misc_feature annotation allows representation of this disrupted gene in a biologically meaningful way, representing the reconstructed ancestral gene.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.

Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions.

    > Given a set of predicted protein-coding genes for a newly sequenced genome, functional annotation involves assigning putative functions to the predicted genes. Two ways in which this can be done are assigning protein names and Gene Ontology (GO;Gene Ontology Consortium, 2010) terms to the predicted proteins. Here we describe a computational pipeline for assigning protein names and GO terms to predicted proteins in parasitic worm (nematode and platyhelminth) genomes, which transfers names and GO terms from orthologues in other species.
    > When assigning protein names, UniProt protein naming rules (www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot) are followed where possible. This recommends that a good and stable name for a protein is "as neutral as possible"; that a protein name "should be, as far as possible, unique and attributed to all orthologs"; and a protein name "should not contain a specific characteristic of the protein, and in particular it should not reflect the function or role of the protein, nor its subcellular location, its domain structure, its tissue specificity, its molecular weight or its species of origin".
    > In our protocol, a protein name is assigned to each predicted protein based on curated names in UniProt (Bairoch & Apweiler, 2000) for human, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schistosoma mansoni orthologues identified from a database of gene families (e.g. built using Ensembl Compara; Vilella et al. 2009), or (if no information is found from orthologues) based on InterPro (Hunter et al. 2012) domains. Figure 1 shows an example of using our protein naming pipeline for four Strongyloides ratti genes that belong to the tubulin polyglutamylase family (underlined in pink), where four different protein names were assigned to them (in pink), based on names of their C. elegans or human orthologues.
    > Since each of the S. ratti genes belonged to a different subfamily of the tubulin polyglutamylase family, they were assigned different names.

    > Whole-genome sequencing has enabled investigations into the gene content of living many organisms and forms the foundation for further study of gene expression, proteomics and epigenetics. After assembly of a novel genome, gene annotation is often the first step in analysing the gene content of an organism. Accurate annotation of the exonic structure of genes is crucial to the success of all subsequent functional and comparative analyses.
    > Problems that can potentially be caused by incorrect gene annotation are numerous and can lead to incorrect assessments of the lifestyle and ecology of an organism. In comparative genomics where orthologous genes or conserved functional domains are compared between species/isolates, the estimated numbers of such genes/ domains can be distorted by less than perfect annotations (as described by Hane et al. [1], S Text 1). Prediction of extracellular secretion, which can be determined by a short signal peptide at the N-terminus, can miss secreted proteins if the start codon of a gene has been incorrectly annotated. Mis-annotating the start of protein translation could either cut off the signal peptide or bury it within the annotation. While a seemingly benign annotation error, the consequences for downstream research could be detrimental, particularly as the biotic interactions or industrial applications of microbes are largely determined by their secretomes. Additionally, translated protein sequences of novel species are often submitted to databases such as NCBI [2] and Uniprot [3]. It is commonplace to use these database entries to support the annotation of related species or isolates, meaning errors present in the pioneer annotation may be repeated. When these new annotations based on false assumptions are added to databases, there is not only a propagation of errors, but also a perceived strengthening of homology evidence for incorrect protein sequences.
    > In recent years, correction of in silico predicted gene annotations with RNA-seq derived transcripts and read alignments has enabled vastly improved genome annotations and corrections of annotated gene structures [4][5][6].

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].
