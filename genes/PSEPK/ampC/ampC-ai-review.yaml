description: >-
  AmpC is a chromosomally encoded class C beta-lactamase (cephalosporinase) that
  hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring of penicillins and cephalosporins. It is localized
  to the periplasm after signal peptide cleavage (~40 kDa mature form). AmpC expression
  is regulated by the LysR-type transcriptional regulator AmpR, which responds to
  muropeptide signals imported via AmpG permease. Environmental cues such as indole
  can induce ampC expression in P. putida KT2440, increasing beta-lactam resistance.
  The enzyme directly confers antibiotic resistance by hydrolyzing beta-lactam antibiotics
  before they reach their targets (penicillin-binding proteins).

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      AmpC is definitively a class C beta-lactamase (EC 3.5.2.6) that catalyzes
      the hydrolysis of beta-lactam antibiotics. This is the core molecular function
      of the protein. UniProt confirms EC=3.5.2.6 and the catalytic activity. The deep
      research confirms AmpC belongs to Ambler class C beta-lactamases that hydrolyze
      penicillins and cephalosporins.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the primary enzymatic function of AmpC. UniProt annotation, InterPro
      domain analysis (IPR058136 AmpC, IPR001586 Beta-lactam_class-C_AS), and
      literature all confirm this enzyme catalyzes beta-lactam hydrolysis. This term
      correctly represents the core molecular function.

    label: hydrolase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This is a parent term of GO:0008800 (beta-lactamase activity). While technically
      correct that AmpC has hydrolase activity, this annotation is redundant given
      the more specific beta-lactamase activity annotation. UniProt keyword mapping
      correctly identifies the hydrolase nature, but the more specific child term
      provides greater biological insight.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This term is accurate but generic. AmpC is indeed a hydrolase - specifically
      hydrolyzing the amide bond in the beta-lactam ring. The UniProt entry includes
      the Hydrolase keyword. While GO:0008800 (beta-lactamase activity) is more
      informative, retaining this broader annotation provides correct categorization
      and is acceptable as a parent term annotation from IEA evidence.

    label: antibiotic catabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This term captures the biological process of AmpC - catabolism of antibiotics.
      However, GO:0030655 (beta-lactam antibiotic catabolic process) is a more specific
      child term that accurately reflects AmpC's substrate specificity. AmpC specifically
      catabolizes beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams),
      not antibiotics in general.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While AmpC does participate in antibiotic catabolism, it specifically catabolizes
      beta-lactam antibiotics. The more specific term GO:0030655 beta-lactam antibiotic
      catabolic process (defined as chemical reactions and pathways resulting in
      the breakdown of a beta-lactam antibiotic) precisely describes AmpC's biological
      process. Literature confirms substrate specificity for penicillins and cephalosporins.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      Periplasmic localization is well-supported for AmpC. UniProt shows a signal
      peptide (residues 1-24) indicating secretion across the inner membrane.
      Deep research confirms AmpC is synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide
      and localizes to the periplasm where it intercepts incoming beta-lactams,
      with mature protein size ~40 kDa after signal peptide cleavage.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This cellular component annotation is correct. AmpC functions in the periplasm
      where it can hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics before they reach their
      targets (penicillin-binding proteins on the inner membrane). The signal
      peptide and periplasmic localization are essential for the resistance
      mechanism. This represents a core aspect of AmpC function.

    label: response to antibiotic
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation captures AmpC's role in the organism's response to antibiotics.
      AmpC expression is induced by beta-lactam antibiotics and environmental signals
      (like indole), and its activity directly confers resistance. This term captures
      the broader biological context of response to antibiotic stress, including the
      regulatory induction. While GO:0030655 more precisely describes the enzymatic
      function, this term appropriately captures the response/resistance phenotype.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation is legitimate for a beta-lactamase. AmpC expression is induced
      by beta-lactam antibiotics through the AmpR-muropeptide signaling pathway, and
      indole also induces ampC expression in P. putida KT2440. The enzyme directly
      responds to antibiotic exposure by increasing expression and activity. Retaining
      both GO:0030655 and this term provides complementary perspectives - one on the
      catabolic process and one on the response/resistance phenotype.

    description: >-
      AmpC is the primary beta-lactamase in P. putida KT2440. It hydrolyzes the
      beta-lactam ring in penicillins and cephalosporins in the periplasm,
      converting these antibiotics to inactive substituted beta-amino acids.
      This activity is the mechanistic basis for intrinsic and inducible
      beta-lactam resistance in this organism.
