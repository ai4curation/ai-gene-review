## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88GP8
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Permease of the drug/metabolite transporter superfamily {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN69270.1};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_3670 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN69270.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** EamA_dom. (IPR000620); EmrE-like. (IPR037185); EamA (PF00892)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_3670" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_3670' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_3670** (gene ID: PP_3670, UniProt: Q88GP8) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Genes overrepresented for nonsynonymous and structural mutations were classified into functional groups based on the functional annotation table constructed with DAVID v.2023q3 91,92 (Table S4). We established the following rules for generalizing genes into functional groups: Chaperone: genes that encode proteins that perform chaperone or chaperonin-like activities (Uniprot Keyword: KW-0143); Envelope: Genes that encode proteins involved in the maintenance of the cell-envelope such as phospholipid biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0008654) and peptidoglycan biosynthesis (GO-BP: 0000270); Metabolism: Genes that encode proteins involved in general metabolic functions, such as purine metabolism (KEGG: eco00230), amino acid metabolism (KEGG: eco00470, eco00330); or TCA Cycle (KEGG: eco00020); Regulators: Genes that encode proteins directly involved in transcription (GO-BP: 0031564; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0804), translation (GO-BP:0006412, GO-BP:0006413; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0689), or the regulation of transcription (GO-BP: 0006355, GO-BP:2000143, GO-BP:0006353, GO-BP: GO:0045893; Uniprot Keyword: KW-0805); and Transport: Genes that encode proteins involved in transport: such as ABC transporters (Interpro: PR017871), MFS transporters (Interpro: IPR011701); symporters (Interpro: IPR023954, IPR001204, IPR001734, IPR023025, IPR004840), or Antiporters (Interpro: IPR004771). A combination of resources were used to determine if a parallel mutation arose in a functional region of a protein including, EcoCyc, 96 UniProt, 97 and the primary literature (see supplemental bibliography).

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > In the genes/metabolites/drugs project type, lists of genes/ proteins (UniProt Accession, RefSeq or gene symbol), metabolites (HMDB, YMDB or ECMD IDs) and/or drugs (DrugBank ID or CAS number) can also be uploaded by the user as a single column TXT file and added to the project (Figure 1.2). Because of the gene symbols redundancies and the presence of aliases in the databases, searching for gene symbols in the selected organism is first performed on Swiss-Prot database and in the case of unreviewed proteins it is extended to TrEMBL database. It is also possible to upload a two-column TXT file containing UniProt Accession, RefSeq or gene symbol and fold change values, respectively, the second one representing expression/concentration levels.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Gene annotations in which merlin's assignment matched the information retrieved from reviewed genes in UniProt can be regarded with higher confidence. In these cases, information was often replicated throughout the remaining databases, such as the case of gene Spr0021.
    > The annotation of genes with incomplete EC number, such as the cases of Spr0022 and Spr0064, required an in-depth analysis. Databases such as KEGG, UniProtKB, and CDD were consulted. In the case of Spr0064, the CDD classified the protein as a sugar isomerase. A search of the protein name assigned by BRENDA returned the EC number 5.3.1.26 which also belonged to the sugar isomerase superfamily. Due to the absence of literature support and information on other databases, the gene was annotated with this EC number and assigned the Label E. Regarding gene Spr0022, KEGG assigned it EC number 3.5.4.33 [tRNA(adenine34) deaminase], UniProtKB annotated the product as a hypothetical protein while BioCyc assigned the EC number 3.5.4.5 (cytidine deaminase) to the gene product. Analysis of the protein sequence on CDD revealed that the gene encoded a protein of the cytidine/deoxycytidilate deaminase superfamily and BLAST on UniProtKB revealed similarity to a gene that encodes a cytidine deaminase protein and search of this protein on BRENDA returned the EC number 3.5.4.5. Thus, this gene was assigned the Label E. Labels A, B, and C account for over 86% of the annotation, with approximately 33, 34, and 20% of the classifications, respectively. There were cases in which genes assigned with incomplete EC numbers (e.g., spr0068) were ultimately annotated with complete ones. Despite the classification as hypothetical protein by KEGG and UniProtKB, the analysis of the conserved domains as well as the availability of complete EC numbers that matched protein function by merlin increased reliability of the assigned function (uridine phosphorylase in this example).

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

- Summary: A comprehensive protein localization analysis of essential genes in 27 prokaryotes including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and 1 archaeon has been performed and shows that proteins encoded by essential genes are enriched in internal location sites, while exist in cell envelope with a lower proportion compared with non-essential ones.

    > Bioinformatics Databases. DEG is a database of essential genes (http://www. essentialgene.org/). The newly released DEG 10 has been developed to accommodate the quantitative and qualitative advancements brought by the progressive identification methods. Currently available records of both essential and nonessential genes among a wide range of organisms can be downloaded from DEG 10, making it possible to compare the two different types of genes in many aspects 21 .
    > 27 prokaryotic organisms including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and Methanococcus maripaludis S2, the only record of the Archaea domain were selected to analyze the protein localization and GO distribution of the essential and nonessential genes. There are 31 bacterial records corresponding to 27 organisms in the database in total and 26 sets of data were selected in the current study. Streptococcus pneumonia was not chosen for the lack of non-essential genes. Since the essential genes were not genome-widely identified, it's not reasonable to regard the complementary set of essential genes as non-essential genes in Streptococcus pneumonia 29,30 . In the case of multiple records for one organism, the one with the most convincing experimental methods was chosen. The non-essential genes in Methanococcus maripaludis S2 and 13 bacteria such as Escherichia coli MG1655 are obtained based on the original literatures, while non-essential genes in other 12 organisms such as Bacillus subtilis 168 are the complementary set of essential genes. The information of the organisms used in the current study are displayed in Table 1.
    > The three model genomes' subcellular location information and the Gene Ontology (GO) terms used for the analysis in the current study were downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt; http://www.uniprot.org). Maintained by the UniProt Consortium, UniProt is committed to providing biologists with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and functional annotation 27 . Among the wealth of annotation data, detailed GO annotation statements are included.

    > Many public databases of gene information are available (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16). However, different public databases often use different sets of unique identifiers (IDs) to describe the same genes or homologous genes in different species. One challenge of comparing large-scale biological datasets is the unification of gene names; otherwise, researchers spend a lot of effort in converting gene IDs when searching different databases. Another is the likelihood of missing some databases due to unfamiliarity; this is particularly true for clinicians and researchers who are specialized in inner ear research but are not necessarily familiar with genomics and bioinformatics. One goal of the SHIELD is to integrate relevant gene annotation information from various public databases in one centralized location.
    > For the SHIELD, annotations were derived from public databases and literature. Currently implemented annotations include official gene symbols, description of the gene name and synonyms, human and mouse chromosome cytogenetic banding, RefSeq RNA and protein (for protein coding genes) accession numbers, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez gene ID, genomic coordinates in both mouse reference genome assemblies mm9 and mm10, Ensembl, the Vertebrate Genome Annotation Database (VEGA) Mouse Genome Informatics, UniProt, Online Mendalian Inheritance in Man and gene ontology.
    > For each protein coding genes, we display all UniProt protein isoforms for that gene, the length in amino acid residues and the predicted number of transmembrane domains (TMs). We predicted TMs by running TMHMM2.0 run on all UniProt protein isoforms of each gene (17). The number of TMs is of special interest for research in sensory function, because many key proteins involved in signaling-such as the mechanotransduction ion channels-are integral membrane proteins. This information would help identify candidate genes for the components of the mechanotransduction apparatus of the inner ear.
    > We also performed manual curation of inner ear disorders including syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss according to the Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org) and primary literature.

Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.

Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions.
