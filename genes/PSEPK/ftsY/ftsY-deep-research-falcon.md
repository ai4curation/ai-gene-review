### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ftsY" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ftsY' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ftsY** (gene ID: ftsY, UniProt: Q88CR9) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: ftsY (Q88CR9) in Pseudomonas putida KT2440

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein identity and family: ftsY encodes the bacterial signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor FtsY, the membrane-associated SR (EC 3.6.5.4) that partners with SRP (Ffh protein + 4.5S RNA) to drive co‑translational targeting of nascent membrane and secretory proteins. FtsY is an SRP-type P-loop NTPase whose catalytic core comprises an NG module (N-terminal regulatory “N” subdomain fused to a Ras-like “G” GTPase subdomain). Bacterial FtsY also contains an acidic A-domain implicated in membrane association and receptor function; in ribosome-bound cryo‑EM reconstructions, the A/N regions are flexibly disposed, consistent with a peripheral, dynamic association at the membrane–ribosome interface (Nature Communications 2016; Nature Communications 2017). URLs: 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10471 (published Jan 2016); 2017, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15470 (published May 2017). (jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 1-2, jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 7-8, ahmad2017structureofthe pages 7-8)
- Core pathway: In bacteria, SRP recognizes exposed hydrophobic signal sequences emerging from the ribosome tunnel, stabilizes the ribosome–nascent chain complex (RNC), and then engages FtsY at the membrane. The SRP–SR (Ffh–FtsY) NG domains heterodimerize in a GTP-dependent manner to form functional early/closed/activated complexes that position the nascent chain for handover to the SecYEG translocon for insertion/translocation (Nature Communications 2016; Nature Communications 2017). URLs: 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10471; 2017, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15470. (jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 1-2, ahmad2017structureofthe pages 7-8)

2) Biochemical mechanism and structural snapshots (emphasis on recent, authoritative sources)
- SRP–FtsY GTPase cycle: Cryo‑EM reconstructions in Escherichia coli captured sequential states of the RNC–SRP–FtsY complexes, including “early,” “closed,” and “activated” NG-domain arrangements that couple GTP binding/dimerization to conformational changes in the SRP M domain and fingerloop that engage the signal sequence at the tunnel exit (uL24/H59), and to approach of the SecYEG translocon. These structures provide near‑atomic details of how SRP–FtsY primes and delivers the nascent chain to SecYEG, and how activation positions the signal sequence for handover (Nature Communications 2016; Nature Communications 2017). URLs: 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10471; 2017, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15470. (jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 1-2, ahmad2017structureofthe pages 7-8, jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 5-6)
- Quaternary assembly with translocon: A cryo‑EM “activated” quaternary complex of RNC–SRP–FtsY–translocon shows a kinked, untwisted SRP RNA that repositions the NG heterodimer and places the translocon near the ribosomal exit, while the signal sequence extends beyond the SRP M‑domain groove towards SecYEG; density for the A/N of FtsY is weak/flexible, consistent with a dynamic peripheral domain. PDB/EMD: 5NCO/EMD‑3617. Published May 2017 (Nature Communications). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15470. (ahmad2017structureofthe pages 7-8, jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 7-8)
- Role of 4.5S RNA: The bacterial SRP RNA accelerates both assembly and disassembly of the Ffh–FtsY NG heterodimer, thereby “catalyzing” the targeting cycle for efficient membrane protein biogenesis. Genetic perturbations of SRP RNA or its partners disrupt competence and virulence pathways in Streptococcus pneumoniae, underscoring the centrality of a fast SRP cycle in vivo (Journal of Bacteriology, Sep 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00004-24. (lin2024signalrecognitionparticle pages 14-16)

3) Subcellular localization and membrane association
- Membrane-proximal action: Structural snapshots of translating ribosomes bound by SRP and FtsY demonstrate that the NG core binds on the ribosome, while the SRP RNA and M domain coordinate the signal sequence and the approach of SecYEG at the membrane. The A/N regions of FtsY are flexibly disposed and incompletely resolved, consistent with a membrane‑associated, dynamic receptor whose acidic A-domain contributes to membrane engagement. These data collectively indicate that FtsY functions at the inner membrane, coupling the RNC to SecYEG during co‑translational targeting (Nature Communications 2016; Nature Communications 2017). URLs: 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10471; 2017, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15470. (jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 1-2, jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 7-8, ahmad2017structureofthe pages 7-8)

4) Essentiality/fitness and organism-specific considerations
- Essentiality context and physiological effects: In streptococci, mutants lacking SRP components (scRNA, ffh, ftsY) show major growth and functional defects, including impaired competence pili production and DNA uptake; some phenotypes are partially rescued by nutritional supplementation. These findings highlight that SRP (and by implication FtsY) is central for membrane protein targeting and cellular fitness across bacteria, even though organismal dependence can vary (Journal of Bacteriology, Sep 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00004-24. (lin2024signalrecognitionparticle pages 14-16)
- Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (PP_5111; Q88CR9): The gene symbol and locus assignment identify the SRP receptor FtsY in KT2440. While species‑specific essentiality scores from KT2440 genome-wide fitness screens were not found in the retrieved corpus, the structural and mechanistic conservation of SRP–FtsY argues that ftsY underpins co-translational targeting to SecYEG in P. putida. Pending KT2440-specific essentiality datasets, FtsY should be presumed critical for robust growth and secretion of inner‑membrane proteins in this chassis organism, by analogy to conserved SRP function (Nature Communications 2016; Nature Communications 2017; Journal of Bacteriology 2024). URLs: 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10471; 2017, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15470; 2024, https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00004-24. (jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 1-2, ahmad2017structureofthe pages 7-8, lin2024signalrecognitionparticle pages 14-16)

5) Pathway context and interactions
- SecYEG handover: High‑resolution SRP–FtsY structures on the ribosome show the M-domain and fingerloop docking the signal helix and contacting rRNA near the exit site, and the spatial proximity required for SecYEG engagement. SecYEG contacts uL23/uL29 on the ribosome, and steric considerations show how the fingerloop and M‑domain C‑terminus vacate to allow Sec loop 6/7 to occupy the site as the signal sequence is transferred. These provide a mechanistic framework for the FtsY‑mediated coupling of cargo delivery to SecYEG (Nature Communications 2016). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10471. (jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 5-6)
- YidC interplay: Bacteria can vary in their reliance on the SRP–Sec pathway versus YidC insertase. In S. pneumoniae, YidC2 does not fully compensate for SRP loss in competence, yet species may shift the balance between SRP‑dependent Sec insertion and YidC‑mediated insertion of particular substrates. This illustrates how FtsY’s central role in SRP targeting integrates with alternative insertases in a species‑specific manner (Journal of Bacteriology, Sep 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00004-24. (lin2024signalrecognitionparticle pages 14-16)

6) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- SRP cycle adaptations, physiology, and virulence: 2024 work in pneumococcus demonstrates that SRP components, including FtsY, drive essential physiological programs such as genetic competence, with mutants exhibiting broad stress and nutrient‑acquisition defects. These data emphasize the speed/efficiency requirement of the SRP cycle (accelerated by SRP RNA) and highlight SRP components as potential intervention points for antimicrobial strategies that impair membrane protein targeting (Journal of Bacteriology, Sep 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00004-24. (lin2024signalrecognitionparticle pages 14-16)
- Structural mechanism reinforced: The cryo‑EM framework for SRP–FtsY engagement, activation, and Sec handover remains the authoritative structural basis for interpreting new organism‑specific observations and for the design of mechanistic probes or inhibitors that target the NG dimerization/hydrolysis steps (Nature Communications 2016; Nature Communications 2017). URLs: 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10471; 2017, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15470. (jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 1-2, ahmad2017structureofthe pages 7-8)

7) Applications, expert views, and quantitative data
- Applications and implementations: The SRP receptor FtsY is a conserved GTPase central to membrane protein biogenesis and thus a conceptual antimicrobial target. Recent physiological studies linking SRP disruption to virulence impairments support this view; any applied design should account for the conserved NG interface and the SRP RNA–accelerated assembly/disassembly kinetics that tune the targeting cycle (Journal of Bacteriology, Sep 2024; Nature Communications 2016/2017). URLs as above. (lin2024signalrecognitionparticle pages 14-16, jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 1-2, ahmad2017structureofthe pages 7-8)
- Quantitative/structural statistics: Cryo‑EM map resolutions and deposited entries exemplify the structural basis. RNC–SRP–FtsY complexes solved at ~3.4–4.3 Å overall, with local filtering for NG domains/SRP RNA (~6 Å) and SecYEG (~4.8 Å) in specific states; quaternary complex deposited as PDB 5NCO/EMD‑3617 (Nature Communications 2017) and multiple ribosome‑bound states documented in 2016 (Nature Communications). URLs: 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10471; 2017, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15470. (jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 5-6, ahmad2017structureofthe pages 7-8)

Expert analysis
- Structural biogenesis experts have established a coherent model in which Ffh’s M‑domain fingerloop and the NG dimer act as a coordinated switch to couple signal sequence capture to FtsY‑mediated docking and GTPase activation, after which GTP hydrolysis and SRP RNA remodeling drive timely disassembly and handover to Sec. The dynamic, weakly resolved N/A regions of FtsY in cryo‑EM reflect a functional flexibility at the membrane, matching a receptor that must engage both ribosome and translocon while sampling membrane contacts (Nature Communications 2016; Nature Communications 2017). URLs: 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10471; 2017, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15470. (jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 1-2, jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 7-8, ahmad2017structureofthe pages 7-8)

Notes on identity verification and ambiguity
- The symbol “ftsY” is used consistently for the bacterial SRP receptor across organisms. The target here is Pseudomonas putida KT2440 ftsY (PP_5111; UniProt Q88CR9). The domain/family description (SRP GTPase; P‑loop NTPase/AAA+‑like fold in the G domain; NG module; acidic A‑domain) aligns with current structural literature (Nature Communications 2016; Nature Communications 2017). (jomaa2016structuresofthe pages 1-2, ahmad2017structureofthe pages 7-8)

Gaps and recommendations
- Species‑specific essentiality/fitness data for ftsY in P. putida KT2440 were not present in the retrieved evidence set. Given SRP’s conserved role and strong phenotypes in bacteria, ftsY is likely critical for growth and membrane protein biogenesis in KT2440; targeted KT2440 RB‑TnSeq/TraDIS datasets should be consulted to quantify essentiality/fitness precisely. Structural/biochemical insights from E. coli SRP–FtsY provide a robust framework for interpreting Pseudomonas data as they become available (Nature Communications 2016; Nature Communications 2017; Journal of Bacteriology 2024).
