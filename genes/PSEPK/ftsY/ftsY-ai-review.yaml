description: >-
  Signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor FtsY is a membrane-associated GTPase
  (EC 3.6.5.4) that functions as the bacterial receptor for the SRP-ribosome-nascent
  chain complex. FtsY contains an NG module (N-terminal regulatory subdomain fused
  to a Ras-like G GTPase subdomain) and an acidic A-domain that mediates membrane
  association. Upon interaction with SRP-bound ribosome-nascent chain complexes,
  FtsY facilitates transfer of nascent membrane proteins to the SecYEG translocon
  for co-translational insertion. Both FtsY and its SRP partner Ffh hydrolyze GTP
  to drive the targeting cycle.

    summary: >-
      FtsY is indeed a nucleotide-binding protein, specifically binding GTP via its
      NG domain. However, this annotation is too general and redundant with the more
      specific GO:0005525 (GTP binding) annotation. The UniProt record confirms GTP
      binding sites at residues 297-304, 379-383, and 443-446 (HAMAP-Rule:MF_00920).
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      While technically correct, 'nucleotide binding' is a very general term that
      provides little functional insight. FtsY specifically binds GTP, not nucleotides
      in general. The annotation GO:0005525 (GTP binding) is already present and
      provides the appropriate level of specificity for this GTPase. The nucleotide
      binding annotation is redundant and should be superseded by the more informative
      GTP binding annotation.

    summary: >-
      GTPase activity is a core molecular function of FtsY. The protein catalyzes
      GTP hydrolysis (EC 3.6.5.4) as part of the SRP targeting cycle. Cryo-EM structures
      demonstrate that FtsY and Ffh form a GTP-dependent heterodimer, and GTP hydrolysis
      by both proteins drives disassembly of the SRP-FtsY complex after nascent chain
      handover to SecYEG (Jomaa et al., 2016; Jomaa et al., 2017).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a well-established core function of FtsY. The catalytic reaction
      (GTP + H2O = GDP + phosphate + H+) is documented in UniProt with HAMAP-Rule
      evidence. Structural studies confirm that GTPase activity is essential for
      the SRP targeting cycle, driving both assembly and disassembly of SRP-FtsY
      complexes during co-translational protein targeting.

    summary: >-
      SRP binding is a core molecular function of FtsY. As the SRP receptor, FtsY
      directly binds to SRP (comprising Ffh protein and 4.5S RNA) through its NG
      domain. Cryo-EM structures captured multiple states of the RNC-SRP-FtsY complex,
      demonstrating the physical interaction between FtsY and SRP components
      (Jomaa et al., 2016; Jomaa et al., 2017).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation accurately describes one of the core molecular functions of
      FtsY. The protein functions specifically as the receptor for SRP, and structural
      studies have characterized the SRP-FtsY interface in detail. The NG domain
      heterodimer formation between FtsY and Ffh (the SRP protein component) is
      central to the co-translational protein targeting mechanism.

      Plasma membrane localization is accurate and represents the primary site of
      FtsY function. FtsY associates with the inner membrane as a peripheral membrane
      protein on the cytoplasmic side. The acidic A-domain mediates membrane
      association. Cryo-EM structures show FtsY positioned at the membrane-ribosome
      interface near SecYEG (Jomaa et al., 2016; Jomaa et al., 2017).

      FtsY is involved in protein targeting, specifically the targeting of nascent

      FtsY is indeed involved in protein targeting to membrane. This annotation
      is accurate but less specific than GO:0006614 (SRP-dependent cotranslational

      co-translational pathway, not in post-translational targeting mechanisms.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

      This annotation is not incorrect, as FtsY does function in targeting proteins
      to membranes. However, GO:0006614 provides the specific mechanism (SRP-dependent,
      cotranslational) that accurately describes FtsY's role. This more general
      term can be retained as it may be useful for broader queries, but it is
      redundant given the presence of the more specific annotation.

      This is the most specific and accurate biological process annotation for FtsY.
      The protein functions as the membrane-associated receptor in the SRP pathway,
