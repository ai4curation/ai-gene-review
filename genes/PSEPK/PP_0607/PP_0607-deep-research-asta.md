## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88Q88
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Type II secretion system protein H {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00021549}; AltName: Full=General secretion pathway protein H {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00030775};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_0607 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66233.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the GSP H family.
- **Key Domains:** Pilin-like. (IPR045584); T2SS_GspH. (IPR022346); GspH (PF12019)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_0607" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_0607' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_0607** (gene ID: PP_0607, UniProt: Q88Q88) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Genes annotated as "hypothetical protein" in the reference genomes were evaluated to refine functional descriptions and to support ontology assignments used in the functional-category analyses. For each hypothetical protein gene, we queried ChlamBase to retrieve curated locus information, alternative gene names, and any community-or literature-derived annotations for the corresponding gene product (74). We also reviewed the corresponding UniProtKB entry to extract the current protein name, description, predicted features, and evidence context for functional annotations (75).
    > To incorporate experimentally supported information not captured in database summaries, we performed targeted PubMed searches using locus tags and commonly used aliases (e.g., CT_694, CTL_0360), as well as gene and protein name synonyms. When peer-reviewed studies provided direct experimental evidence (e.g., secretion via the type III secretion system, inclusion membrane localization, interaction partners, or phenotypes associated with targeted mutagenesis or knockdown), we used those findings to refine the functional description applied in this study

Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Whole-genome sequencing has enabled investigations into the gene content of living many organisms and forms the foundation for further study of gene expression, proteomics and epigenetics. After assembly of a novel genome, gene annotation is often the first step in analysing the gene content of an organism. Accurate annotation of the exonic structure of genes is crucial to the success of all subsequent functional and comparative analyses.
    > Problems that can potentially be caused by incorrect gene annotation are numerous and can lead to incorrect assessments of the lifestyle and ecology of an organism. In comparative genomics where orthologous genes or conserved functional domains are compared between species/isolates, the estimated numbers of such genes/ domains can be distorted by less than perfect annotations (as described by Hane et al. [1], S Text 1). Prediction of extracellular secretion, which can be determined by a short signal peptide at the N-terminus, can miss secreted proteins if the start codon of a gene has been incorrectly annotated. Mis-annotating the start of protein translation could either cut off the signal peptide or bury it within the annotation. While a seemingly benign annotation error, the consequences for downstream research could be detrimental, particularly as the biotic interactions or industrial applications of microbes are largely determined by their secretomes. Additionally, translated protein sequences of novel species are often submitted to databases such as NCBI [2] and Uniprot [3]. It is commonplace to use these database entries to support the annotation of related species or isolates, meaning errors present in the pioneer annotation may be repeated. When these new annotations based on false assumptions are added to databases, there is not only a propagation of errors, but also a perceived strengthening of homology evidence for incorrect protein sequences.
    > In recent years, correction of in silico predicted gene annotations with RNA-seq derived transcripts and read alignments has enabled vastly improved genome annotations and corrections of annotated gene structures [4][5][6].

- Summary: CRONOS, a cross-reference server that contains entries from five mammalian organisms presented by major gene and protein information resources, is developed, which shows that the cross-references are highly accurate.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.729)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Users can study individual (pathogen or host) proteins on the "Proteins" page of the Web interface. For example, users can search either for a B. mallei protein to determine its association with a secretion system, or for a host (human or murine) protein to determine whether it interacts with a pathogen protein associated with a secretion system. Protein searches can be performed using one of the following known protein/gene identifiers: Locus Tag, Name, Uniprot ID, Uniprot Name, Gene ID, GenInfo Identifier (GI), and KEGG ID.
    > When the query protein is represented in the database, DBSecSys returns its detailed annotation information, including protein/gene identifiers from different annotation databases (see above), chromosomal location, amino acid sequence information, and corresponding GO [36] and KEGG [37,38] annotations. All annotation information is linked with its external source. If the host-B. mallei interactions data is available for the queried protein, DBSecSys provides a list of host-pathogen PPIs for that protein. Additionally, if the queried protein is a pathogen protein, the database provides information about its associated secretion system, inferred mechanisms of action, and, if it was tested for virulence attenuation, information about its effect on virulence. Conversely, if the queried protein is a host protein, DBSecSys provides information about pathogen proteins that target this host protein, e.g., the secretion systems with which they are associated and their inferred mechanisms of action.
    > Application 2: Study of pathogen proteins associated with a secretion system Users can study pathogen proteins associated with a specific secretion system on the "Secretion Systems" page of the Web interface. This page allows users to select one of the secretion systems associated with B. mallei and list all pathogen proteins associated with it.

    > Finally, using literature information, we manually compiled a list of B. mallei secretion system proteins that have been experimentally evaluated for virulence attenuation (by genetic ablation) in an animal model. The list contains proteins identified in B. mallei studies [28] and proteins computationally inferred from B. pseudomallei studies using orthology information [30,33,34].
    > We used NCBI [17,18] and Uniprot [35] to annotate pathogen and host proteins, e.g., protein names and sequence information. For functional annotation of host proteins, we used Gene Ontology (GO) terms [36] and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways [37,38].

Metabolic enzymes represented the largest class (174 genes, 26.9%), including pathways for amino acid biosynthesis (aroA, trpB, leuC), nucleotide metabolism (guaB, carA), and central carbon metabolism (galE, aceF). Transport systems accounted for 108 genes (16.7%), domi-nated by ABC transporters and permeases. Regulatory genes (58 genes, 9.0%) encompassed global regulators such as crp, fnr, and arcA, as well as RNA chaperones (hfq) and stringent response modulators (dksA). Additional categories included DNA/RNA metabolism (30 genes, 4.6%), secretion-related components (19 genes, 2.9%), cell envelope biosynthesis (13 genes, 2.0%), and adhesion factors (6 genes, 0.9%).
    > These results indicate that the pathogenicity potential of strain P6 arises from an intricate interplay between metabolism, regulation, and secretion processes.
    > 3.6.4. Characterization of the Secretome SignalP 5.0 analysis identified 142 proteins containing N-terminal signal peptides (Table S11). These were predominantly distributed across Scaffold1 (46 proteins, 32.2%) and Scaffold2 (36 proteins, 25.2%). D-scores ranged from 0.517 to 0.953 (mean: 0.735 ± 0.093), with signal peptide probability scores averaging 0.913 ± 0.057. Classification indicated that 141 proteins (99.3%) were of the SignalP-noTM type, suggesting classical Sec or Tat pathway-mediated secretion, whereas only two proteins (1.4%) were SignalP-TM, likely membrane-anchored forms.

    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > Names/descriptions are divided into two parts separated by a hyphen, the first describing the subcellular localization group and the second the protein function. For cytoplasmic proteins, no topological suffixes are added. Integral membrane proteins are labeled as "Integral membrane protein -", lipoproteins as "Secreted lipoprotein" and extracellular proteins, determined as described below, start with "Secreted protein". For secreted proteins, we include in parenthesis the secretion system that is used for their translocation through the membrane [e.g. (Sec), (TAT) or (T7SS)]. In the second part of the name we include a description of the protein function (e.g. "Esterase"). For example, protein A0A076MHP6 (Uniprot accession) was re-annotated from "uncharacterized protein" to "DNA alkylation repair enzyme" because of its structural similarity with the proteins of this family, as it is described by InterPro, and protein A0A076M7D5 was re-annotated from "secreted protein" to "Secreted protein (Sec)-Solute-binding family 1 protein".
    > In total, more than 4000 protein descriptions (~ 53% of the proteome) were re-annotated and are included in the database. For example, it has been reported that S. coelicolor A3(2) contains two genes encoding Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor-like (SSI) proteins (genes SCO0762, SCO4010) [34]. For S. lividans TK24, the homologue of the second of these two genes was labeled in Uniprot as "uncharacterized protein", however we assigned the re-annotated protein name based on structural similarity search in InterPro and matching with the homologous proteins of S. coelicolor. To help the user, all the re-annotated protein names/descriptions are presented in a downloadable table and online (see below) next to the current Uniprot name and a link to the relevant Uniprot WWW page.

    > 3. Gene annotation and functional annotation. a. Gene structure annotation.
    > In addition to gene prediction models, evidence from orthologous protein sequences and transcriptome assembly could be used to improve annotation quality. Protein sequences of orthologous genes can be obtained from UniProt (The UniProt, 2017). Ones from Swiss-Port have been reviewed and thus are of higher quality. Transcriptome assembly may be available from previous studies or can be assembled de novo from RNA-seq reads by Trinity (Haas et al., 2013). High quality transcriptome assembly can be selected as described in (Zhang et al., 2021). Note: Details about gene structure annotation (Holt and Yandell, 2011) can be found at http:// gmod.org/wiki/MAKER_Tutorial, https://darencard.net/blog/2017-05-16-maker-genomeannotation/, and the protocol (Campbell et al., 2014).
    > b. Quality measurement and functional annotation.
    > For each predicted gene, Maker2 provides the annotation edit distance (AED) score, which measures the goodness of fit between its predicted gene structure and its evidence support. The lower the score, the more accurate the prediction. If more than 90% genes with AED scores lower than 0.5, the genome can be considered well annotated. In addition to the AED score, a high proportion of recognizable domains contained in predicted protein -e.g., higher than 50% -also indicates a good annotation. Recognizable protein domains can by scanned by InterProScan (Jones et al., 2014), assigning potential function to predicted genes.
    > Note: Besides the aforementioned quality measurement, we strongly recommend measuring the completeness of the genome assembly and annotation by checking the existence of a set of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) (Simao et al., 2015). A high-level completeness of genome assembly and annotation is imperative for a better identification of gene expansion. Based on the result of this analysis, researchers can decide whether they need to further improve the genome assembly before predicting gene expansion. A detailed protocol of BUSCO is available at

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

    > The BLASTx homology search tool, a component of the standalone NCBI-blast-2.3.0+, was used to perform functional annotation of the F. udum genes (Altschul et al., 1990). With a cut-off E value of ≤1e−06 and a similarity of 34%, BLASTx identified the homologous sequences of the genes in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using Blast2GO PRO 4.1.5 (Conesa and Gotz, 2008). In three different mappings, B2G performed as follows: (1) Using two NCBI-provided mapping files, blast result accessions are used to get gene names (symbols; gene info, gene 2 accessions). (2) Blast result GI identifiers were used to retrieve UniProt IDs using a mapping file from PIR (non-redundant reference protein database), which includes PSD, Swiss-Prot, UniProt, TrEMBL, GenPept, RefSeq, and PDB. The names of the identified genes were searched in the species-specific entries of the gene product table of the GO database. With the aid of the KAAS-KEGG Automatic Annotation Server, pathway analyses were carried out. This database provides functional annotation of genes using other data servers (Moriya et al., 2007). Accessions from the blast results were looked for in the DBXRef table of the GO database.

    > The assembled contig sequences were processed by our in-house pipeline for gene prediction and annotation using the genome of serotype A1 as a guide. We adapted the protocol previously developed by The Institute for Genomic Research (J. Craig Venter Institute). Briefly, Glimmer3, Exonerate and tRNAscan SE tools were used to predict protein-, rRNA-and tRNA-coding genes respectively [20][21][22]. All protein-coding genes were then annotated by using the RAST annotation pipeline http://rast.nmpdr.org/ [23]. Each protein sequence was also BLAST searched against Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) database using the NCBI BLAST package [24,25]. Then a COG identification number was assigned to each gene if the best BLASTP hit exhibits at least 80% sequence coverage in both query and hit sequences and at least 30% protein sequence identity. Finally, protein-coding genes were analyzed to identify putative frameshift mutations using BLAST Extend-Repraze http://ber.sourceforge. net/. Genes containing frameshift mutations were considered as putative pseudogenes. Unique genes of each genome were identified by BLAST searching each gene sequence to the genome of another strain with an Evalue cutoff of 1e-6. A gene was considered unique if no significant hit was reported. Novel computational methods were used to detect evidence of secreted effector proteins for the type III secretion system and web based software (http://www.genome.jp/, KEGG pathway) was used to detect secretion system components [26].

    > Scientists can find querying datasets useful to identify expression levels between disease and normal pairs to discover differential expression for a gene. They may also want to research on potential biomarkers or pathways that lead to tumor formation or want to explore the overall expression of specific genes across multiple cancer types. Users can search BioXpress using HGNCapproved gene symbols (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee), UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot accessions or RefSeq accessions. Differentially expressed genes for a specific cancer type can also be retrieved. Additionally, all data in BioXpress, including lists of genes significantly differentially expressed in two or more cancer types, can be downloaded.
    > Searching using gene name (gene/protein-centric search)
    > A search using the HGNC-approved gene symbol or UniProt/RefSeq accession retrieves differential expression information (cancer vs. normal), tumor-only expression data (where normal samples are not available) and baseline expression information from normal human tissues (Illumina Human Body Map Project). The example below provides an overview of a gene/protein-centric search.

    > The database enables searching by gene symbols/names, GenBank accession numbers, UniGene cluster IDs, Swiss-Prot entry names and several unique clone IDs (IMAGE clone IDs, University of Iowa clone IDs, Operon oligo IDs, TAIR IDs and a subset of selected Affymetrix and Agilent IDs).
    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

- Summary: A data-driven approach using massive sequence data may contribute to a broader understanding of HGT in prokaryotes, and predicted that six as-yet-uncharacterized genes were widely distributed HT genes, and therefore, will be interesting targets for evolutionary studies.

    > Focusing on uncharacterized HT genes in the COG and KEGG databases, four gene groups (COG3209, COG1479, COG3291, and COG3791) were classified into "general function prediction only" (COG category code = R) or "function unknown" (S) according to the COG annotation. By adding two gene groups of "uncharacterized protein" (K08998 and K07062) from the KEGG annotation, a total of six were obtained as functionally ambiguous HT gene groups despite being distributed among more than 300 species. With reference to COG3209 (uncharacterized conserved protein RhaS, contains 28 RHS repeats), the genes encoded in E. coli have been suggested to be horizontally transferred from another organism. 43 Recently, RHS repeat-containing genes are reported to be involved in toxins against competitors 44 ; therefore, the genes in COG3209 could be considered as defense system genes. The functions of COG1479 (uncharacterized conserved protein, contains ParB-like and HNH nuclease domains), COG3291 (PKD repeat), and COG3791 (uncharacterized conserved protein) have yet to be examined. According to InterPro analysis, COG3791 genes have a domain of glutathione-dependent formaldehyde-activating enzyme (IPR006913); therefore, these genes might be related to formaldehyde detoxification. 45 The KO group, K08998, corresponds to COG0759 (membraneanchored protein YidD) of category M in the COG database that has previously been reported to be involved in the protein insertion process. 46 K07062 corresponds to COG1487 and is considered a toxic protein. 47 As a whole, it has to be said that the evolutionary significance of these six gene groups has not been fully realized. Conversely, these genes might be good targets for evolutionary studies in the context of HGT, providing an example of data-driven approaches from massive sequence data. 48
