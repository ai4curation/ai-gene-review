## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88H07
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Amino acid transporter, periplasmic amino acid-binding protein {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN69159.1};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_3558 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN69159.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** ABC_Gly_betaine_transp_sub-bd. (IPR007210); OpuAC (PF04069)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_3558" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_3558' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_3558** (gene ID: PP_3558, UniProt: Q88H07) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > To assign functional or gene categories, we integrated cancer genes, tumor suppressors, epigenetic regulators, DNA damage repair genes, human essential genes, kinases and transcription factors. In each gene group, we checked the retention and ORFs of the main protein functional features. There are 13 features belonging to the 'region' category, including 'calcium binding', 'coiled coil', 'compositional bias', 'DNA binding', 'domain', 'intramembrane', 'motif', 'nucleotide binding', 'region', 'repeat', 'topological domain', 'transmembrane' and 'zinc finger'. To perform the protein functional feature retention search, we first downloaded the GFF (General Feature Format) format protein information of 10 651 UniProt accessions from UniProt for 10 619 genes involved in 15 030 fusion genes ( 10 ). UniProt provides the loci information of 39 protein features, including six molecule processing features, 13 region features, four site features, six amino acid modification features, two natural variation features, five experimental info features and three secondary structure features. Since such feature loci information is based on amino acid sequences, the genomic breakpoint information was converted into the amino acid level while considering all UniProt protein accessions, ENST isoforms and multiple breakpoints for each partner. To map each feature to the human genome sequence, we used the GENCODE (v19) gene model of human reference genome ( 11 ). For the 5 -partner gene, we considered the protein feature to be retained in the fusion gene if the breakpoints occurred on the 3 -end of the protein feature. On the contrary, if a protein domain was not entirely included in the fusion amino acid sequence, we reported such fusion genes as having not retained that protein feature. Similarly, for the 3partner gene, we considered the fusion gene to have retained the protein feature if the breakpoints occurred on the 5 -end of the protein feature region.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > However, the peaks were in different positions within the gene in the four individual experiments performed (Fig. 6), and no specific binding site within the mRNA could be identified from the data.
    > Among the genes identified were numerous genes related to protein biosynthesis (tRNAs, tRNA-aminoacyl synthetases, tRNA-modifying enzymes, ribosomal proteins). As an example, genes for ribosomal proteins were highly represented with 18 out of the 22 genes (82%) for small ribosomal proteins, (12 after cold shock, 55%), and 31 out of 34 genes (91%) for large ribosomal subunit proteins (22 after cold shock, 65%). Other protein families represented were chaperones (e.g., dnaK, dnaJ, grpE, but not dafA, groES, groEL, clpB), cold-shock and general stress proteins (TT_RS08235, _09210; hsp22, hsp30; uspA), topoisomerase genes (gyrA, gyrB, topA), genes for transporters and their subunits (often both the gene for the substrate-bind-ing protein and for the permease, for example, branchedchain amino acid ABC transporter, TT_RS01115 and _01120), and genes related to sugar-and cell wall metabolism and cell division, as well as CRISPR-related genes. In many cases, genes for all subunits of protein complexes (e.g., genes for cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II; clpA, clpX coding for the ClpAX protease) were present.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > The manual classification process included four steps, which are highlighted in Fig. 1B. Universal protein resource (Uniprot) [28] was used to access annotation information on the dataset by using the unique Ensembl protein identification associated with each protein. Uniprot is a large comprehensive repository of protein sequences with manually curated as well as automatically generated associated annotations. For each protein, the associated UniProt annotations were used in the curation process: gene name, sequence status, review status, Consensus Coding Sequence identifier, Transporter Classification number, Enzyme Commission number, Pfam domain information, Gene Ontology annotation terms, and protein family information.
    > The Uniprot sequence information is derived from translated sequences that have been submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), which is EMBL-bank, GenBank, and DDBJ. The canonical sequence is determined from either the most prevalent, the most similar to orthologous sequences, the properties of the amino acid composition, or in lieu of nothing else, then the longest sequence. The sequence status is defined as either complete or fragment, in which the canonical sequence is missing amino acid residues, often in the initial or terminal ends. Those protein sequences identified as fragments were considered invalid proteins and culled from the dataset. To reduce falsepositive predictions from TOPCONS-single, proteins that were identified in literature or database sources as having less than or greater than four-transmembrane segments were also removed from the dataset.
    > The initial gene annotation source, GenCode, has ~1050 more protein-coding gene entries than the most conservative annotation resource, the Consensus Coding Sequence dataset (CCDS) [64]. Therefore the CCDS identifier was used to assess the validity of each protein, i.e. that each has acceptable transcriptional support and recognized protein-coding annotation. Additionally, the sequence status, CCDS identifier, and sequence length were used to ensure that the predicted protein was the main (or canonical) protein product of the gene and not an isoform. There are eight predicted proteins in the dataset that do not have a CCDS identifier associated with them.

    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > We used amino acid sequence data from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) UniProt Consortium [2025] and associated gene DNA coding sequences in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) Leinonen et al. [2010]. The UniProt database is divided into two sections: (i) UniProt/TrEMBL (which includes more sequence diversity but more annotation errors owing to homology-based annotations and error propagation Schnoes et al. [2009]) and (ii) UniProt/SwissProt (which is carefully curated and provides high confidence accurate functional annotations). For this study, we limited the data retrieved to prokaryotic organisms in SwissProt (May 2025) UniProt Consortium [2025].
    > We mapped UniProt/SwissProt accession numbers to corresponding identifiers in UniRef (Universal Protein Resource Reference Clusters) UniRef50, UniRef90, and UniRef100, which define protein clusters based on amino acid sequence identity at 50, 90, and 100 percent amino acid identity respectively; and to their corresponding EMBL CDS IDs for gene coding sequences in the ENA database Leinonen et al. [2010] using ID mapping files uni [2021], Wang et al. [2021] from UniProtKB. Each EMBL CDS ID's corresponding DNA sequence was then obtained from ENA. EC numbers that were either incomplete or missing were removed from the dataset. Individual entries were created for UniProt records with more than one EMBL CDS ID in the nucleotide version of the dataset.

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

    > To obtain comprehensive gene function information, we performed gene function annotation using eight major databases, including UniProt [23], KEGG [24] and KEGG Pathway, GO [25], Pfam [26], COG [27], TIGERfams [28], RefSeq, and NR. The predicted gene sequences were aligned against functional databases such as COG, KEGG, UniProt, and RefSeq using BLAST+ (Version: 2.11.0+), resulting in the gene function annotation outcomes. The statistical results of the annotations are shown in Table S2. Among the top 20 domains annotated based on Pfam, we observed that genes belonging to "ABC transporters" were the most abundant (Figure 2A). As we know, ABC transporters comprise a large superfamily of proteins that facilitate the translocation of a diverse array of substrates, including ions and macromolecules, across cellular membranes through ATP binding and hydrolysis. Furthermore, these transporters are also critically involved in the cellular uptake and efflux of numerous organic pollutants [29,30]. These results suggest that the abundance of ABC transporter genes provides Paracoccus sp. P-2 with a significant capacity for deltamethrin transport. As shown in Figure 2B, the genes annotated by KEGG are divided into 5 major categories and 23 minor subcategories. Among them, the subcategory with the largest number of genes is metabolic pathways, which include amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, among others. The abundance of genes related to metabolic pathways provides the fundamental basis for the survival and deltamethrin degradation capability of Paracoccus sp. P-2. It is worth noting that a substantial number (254) of membrane transporter genes have been annotated in the genome of Paracoccus sp. P-2. Pollutants are often adsorbed onto the microbial membrane surface and subsequently internalized into the cells-a process in which membrane transporter proteins play a crucial role [31]. This abundance of transporter genes highlights the strain's strong capacity for pollutant transport.

    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

- Summary: The wild strain of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the DH5α strain of Escherichia coli were grown in their own specific media, then cultured for 48 hours and 72 hours by cultivating in media containing 0,1% glucose with different cell number, and finally the differentiation in the proteins released by the cells into the medium was observed in SDS polyacrylamide gels.

    > The proteins identified as a result of LC-MS/MS analysis were evaluated in UniProt and the names and functions of the proteins are given as an appendix. Here, 6 protein-coding genes in the bands of the proteins released into the medium by the co-culture were found in the S.pombe genome and were classified according to their biological functions and cellular locations using the online platform PANTHER (Figure 2). Other 257 protein-coding genes were found in the E. coli genome. These proteins were also classified according to their cellular location (Figure 3) and their cellular functions (Figure 4). Maltose/maltodextrin-binding periplasmic protein (malE) and D-galactose-binding periplasmic protein (mglB) found in E. coli cells are among the binding proteins found in LC-MS-MS results. The binding protein MglB has a high affinity for glucose (Ferenci, 1996), and at low glucose concentration, glucose is mainly taken up by cells in this way. In a study by Egli et al. (1993), giving 1.8 mg l−1 galactose to a low glucose-containing E. coli culture decreased the glucose utilization of the cells and led to glucose accumulation in continuous culture. In addition, Hua and., (2004) found that the expression of a series of genes encoding membrane transporter proteins was significantly induced in cultures of limited chemostats for various carbon sources, and that about half of these genes were maltose (all genes of malGFE and malK-lamB-malM operons), galactose. They showed that there are genes involved in a wide variety of high-affinity ABC transport systems that facilitate uptake (three genes of the mglBAC operon). In E. coli, the ABC transporter gene family covers approximately 5% of the entire genome (Linton and Higgins, 1998). This shows how important these genes are. Carbon-limited cultures have been proposed to investigate bacterial growth and behavior under environmental conditions (Matin, 1979;Moriarty, 1993;Morita, 1993).

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > ProteoSushi assigns each peptide to all proteins with a matching sequence in the userprovided FASTA proteome using the amino acid sequence of each modified peptide. Leucines and isoleucines, which are isobaric and can't be distinguished through mass spectrometry, are considered equivalent. Proteins in UniProt reference proteome are not equally likely studied and characterized resulting in a wide range of annotation quality and depth. Therefore, ProteoSushi compares the UniProt annotation scores of all matched proteins and annotates the peptide with the available information of those with the highest score (Supp. Fig. S1). This approach minimizes over-annotation and prioritizes assignment to better characterized proteins. This is especially useful for species that are not annotated well. The primary gene name assigned to the UniProt ID is used to assign the gene, and the modified residue(s) of the peptide are assigned to the amino acid number in the UniProt amino acid sequence.
    > ProteoSushi provides an option for a user-input list of gene names to prioritize identification to a specific subset of candidate proteins. Potential applications of this include organelle or protein complex enrichment prior to PTM enrichment, such as mitochondrial fractionation followed by enrichment for lysine acetylation 4 . In this case, the user can input a list of mitochondrial genes and ProteoSushi will prioritize assignment of peptides to these genes instead of cytoplasmic proteins that may have sequence homology. The ProteoSushi output indicates that the assigned proteins are in the target list to simplify follow-up analysis.
    > To compare how proteins and genes are assigned by ProteoSushi versus typical proteincentric database search software, the data output from MaxQuant were compared before and after ProteoSushi processing. A publicly available proteomic dataset that enriched and quantified the reversible oxidation of ~4,000 cysteines 29 was used for evaluation.

    > There are several knowledge bases that represent the collected knowledge of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome: EcoCyc (11), EcoGene (12), UniProt (13) and RefSeq (14). Other useful knowledge bases cater to specific classes of gene products, such as the RegulonDB, which contains manually curated functional information about transcription factors in E. coli (15). Our initial review of these knowledge bases yielded conflicting information on gene function and level of annotation for many E. coli genes. Any attempt to systematically assess the function of unannotated genes must therefore draw from multiple knowledge bases and resolve these conflicts.
    > Many research groups have categorized E. coli genes and proteins by annotation quality as a part of their studies. In 2009, Hu et (16). First, they identified all unannotated proteins in the K-12 W3110 and MG1655 genomes. In order for a protein-encoding gene to be considered functionally uncharacterized in their analysis, it had to meet the following criteria: (i) The gene name begins with 'y', (ii) the gene does not have a known pathway within EcoCyc and (iii) the gene does not have a functional description in Gen-ProtEC (17) (any gene with a description containing the words 'predicted', 'hypothetical', or 'conserved'). Based on these criteria, it was determined that 1431 of 4225 protein coding sequences were not functionally annotated. In 2015, Kim et al. published a database called EcoliNet that curated and predicted cofunctional gene networks for every protein coding gene in the E. coli genome (18). This study also quantified the number of uncharacterized protein coding genes in E. coli. To assess functional annotation, they used the presence of experimentally supported 'biological process' annotations in the Gene Ontology database (19). They concluded that ∼2000 protein coding genes in E. coli were not functionally annotated. The most comprehensive effort to assess the level of annotation in bacterial genomes has been Computational Bridges to Experiments (COM-BREX) (20,21).

    > Three proteins (RPA2499, RPA2628, and RPA3810) were identified as amino acid binding proteins via the FTS screening (Table 1). This observation is consistent with the assigned annotation and the general functional prediction of TransportDB (Table 2). The set of binding proteins specific for amino acids provide transport capabilities for seven of the individual amino acids. The genes encoding the RPA2628 (PBP), RPA2629 and RPA2630 (integral membrane subunits) (methionine/ cysteine/histidine) are orthologs of a verified amino acid transporter in Rhizobium leguminosarum [32]. They are also localized in a cluster of 10 ABC transporter proteins containing four periplasmic binding proteins (three screened by FTS assay, Additional file 1) and RPA2628 was the only protein with specific ligand binding. The characterized set of binding proteins reflects an emphasis on maintenance of sulfate and nitrogen stores. RPA2499, annotated as an arginine binding protein, is adjacent to an "amidase" gene. Asparagine has a N:C ratio of 2:4, which makes it an efficient molecule for the storage and transport of nitrogen.
