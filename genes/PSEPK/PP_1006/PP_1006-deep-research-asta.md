## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88P47
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Outer membrane heme receptor {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66631.2};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_1006 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66631.2};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the TonB-dependent receptor family.
- **Key Domains:** Beta-barrel_TonB. (IPR000531); Beta-barrel_TonB_sf. (IPR036942); Plug_dom. (IPR012910); Plug_dom_sf. (IPR037066); Secretin/TonB_short_N. (IPR011662)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_1006" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_1006' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_1006** (gene ID: PP_1006, UniProt: Q88P47) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > Functional annotation of the genes was obtained from the EnsamblPlant database (Biomart), and annotation descriptions of the genes were matched against IWGSC Refseq annotation v 1.1. Nucleotide and corresponding protein sequences were extracted from EnsamblPlant. The predicted protein functions were checked in several online databases like Uniprot (https://www.uniprot.org) (accessed on 8 August 2020), Pfam (https://pfam. xfam.org) (accessed on 8 August 2020), and EnsamblPlant (Table 1). The annotation description of HC and LC genes and other information are presented in File S1. Available information from functional annotation indicates some proteins were parts of cellular components such as the plasma membrane, an integral part of the membrane, and intracellular anatomical structure. Molecular functions indicated HC genes were involved in ATP binding, GTP binding, GTPase activity, heme binding, protein binding, and oxidoreductase activity. The biological processes of the HC genes indicated their involvement in DNA replication, protein transport, photomorphogenesis, oxidoreductase activity, cell-cell signaling, chloroplast organization, and transcription regulation. The annotation description of most low-confidence genes is arabinogalactan peptide 14, which is involved in diverse developmental roles such as differentiation, cellcell recognition, embryogenesis, and programmed cell death in Arabidopsis, but is absent in wheat. No other information is available for these genes. Therefore, based on the gene functional analysis results, the downstream analysis was focused on only the highconfidence genes.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > CellPhoneDB stores ligand-receptor interactions, as well as other properties of the interacting partners, including their subunit architecture and gene and protein identifiers. To create the content of the database, four main .csv data files are required: gene_input.csv, protein_input.csv, complex_input.csv and interaction_input.csv (Fig. 4).
    > gene_input Mandatory fields are 'gene_name', 'uniprot', 'hgnc_symbol' and 'ensembl'. This file is critical for establishing the link between the scRNA-seq data and the interaction pairs stored at the protein level. It includes the following gene and protein identifiers: (i) gene name ('gene_name'), (ii) UniProt identifier ('uniprot'), (iii) HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbol ('hgnc_symbol') and (iv) gene Ensembl identifier (ENSG) ('ensembl'). To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > Using the Uniprot IDs of human iron interacting proteins provided by Andreini et al, corresponding standard human gene names were identified using the Uniprot mapping tool (https://www.uniprot.org/uploadlists/) (16). To curate an equivalent list of mouse iron interacting protein homologues, the list of human iron interacting genes was input into the Ensembl BioMart tool (http://useast.ensembl.org/biomart/ martview/893cea99357a57529ab65ce92c12e306) selecting for comparison to the Ensembl Genes 100 database, Human genes (GRCh38.p13) dataset (Supplementary File 1) (17). Filtering was completed by gene name using an external reference ID list and selecting for the attributes: gene stable ID, gene name, mouse gene stable ID, mouse gene name and gene description. This method was able to identify mouse homologues for the majority of human iron interacting proteins (349/398, 88%). In cases where gene matches were not identified by Ensembl, manual verification was completed and several more matches were identified (8 proteins). Some human iron interacting proteins were found to have no mouse homologues (23 proteins, ex//KDM4E, SCD5, NOX5, etc.) or poor gene annotation limited the identification of matches (18 proteins, ex//CYP2C, FADS2P1, DKFZp686G0638). To obtain further cofactor information regarding protein to iron atom stoichiometry, the Uniprot database was manually searched using the cofactor terms: 4Fe-4S, 3Fe-3S, 2Fe-2S, heme, Fe2+, Fe3+. Retrieved cofactor information was manually added to the list of iron interacting information Notably, the iron interacting protein list does not include proteins that indirectly interact with iron such as TFRC which interacts with iron via intermediate contact with Tf. The resulting list of mouse iron interacting proteins is relatively comprehensive but likely does not include the complete set of iron interacting proteins.

    > List of genes and genomic features (GFF) for Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 genome (PlasmoDB release 66) was downloaded and protein-coding genes were extracted along with their gene annotations and genomic location. Additional genomic annotations were obtained by querying PlasmoDB to extract UniProt and Entrez ID(s), ortholog group (OrthoMCL), protein features (CDS and protein length, molecular weight, isoelectric point), domain annotations (InterPro, Pfam, and Superfamily), number of transmembrane (TM) domains, and enzyme commission (EC) numbers. Gene function (Gene Ontology components, functions, and processes) was extracted either from PlasmoDB or by querying the InterPro ID with the InterPro2GO mapping tool from EMBL-EBI. Gene essentiality data was obtained for P. falciparum 20 and P. berghei 21,22 parasites mapped to their falciparum orthologs using OrthoMCL orthology group IDs. Protein Data Bank (PDB) IDs of crystal structures were obtained by searching either gene symbols, UniProt IDs associated with each gene, or the term "Plasmodium". A report with gene identifier, organism, accession number, method for structure determination and publication information was extracted for the search hits.
    > Mapping genes to associated literature publications A download from the NCBI FTP site was performed for gene2pubmed.gz (version 2024-02-21) containing taxonomy ID, gene ID (Entrez) and PubMed ID information. Gene IDs were mapped to the P. falciparum 3D7 annotation set, and corresponding PMIDs were extracted. To include literature references associated with gene symbols, we queried each symbol in PubMed using the Eutils 77 efetch function from NCBI; additional information for each publication was obtained pragmatically using the same tool, namely title, authors and digital object identifier (DOI). Literature references from gene nomenclature extraction were manually reviewed and filtered for unrelated records (e.g., same name but different meaning across organisms/diseases).

    > Cufflinks output files had transcripts identified by uniprot accessions. Using the DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) [67] Gene ID conversion tool, uniprot accessions were converted to Locus Tag IDs and Protein IDs. Once all accessions were converted, the DAVID Functional Annotation tool was used to retrieve gene names as well as KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Pathway information. For genes that were identified as hypothetical proteins, searches were performed on the JGI Phaeodactylum tricornutum v2.0 genome website (http://genome.jgi-psf. org/Phatr2/Phatr2.home.html) and based on best hits, % ID, score, and consistency of the top hits, genes were either identified or remained as hypothetical. Genes were also searched on NCBI and ENSEMBL genome browsers for cross-referencing. To assign genes into pathways, we used KEGG maps for P. tricornutum as a backbone. Genes for major pathways were searched manually to find genes not directly annotated in the P. tricornutum KEGG maps. Gene lists were compiled for the major pathways and developed into network maps.
    > Organelle targeting for transcript products was done based on annotations from the databases of JGI, NCBI, and ENSEMBL. If no localization was found, eukaryotic organelle localizations were predicted with TargetP 1.1. server [68] in both plant and non-plant mode. Amino acid sequences were also checked for a peroxisomal targeting sequence (SKL, serine-lysine-leucine). If potential targeting was not identified, we assumed that the gene product occurred in the cytoplasm. If the gene was an integral membrane protein we again checked JGI, NCBI, and ENSEMBL, and if targeting could not be determined we located the gene in the most biologically relevant membrane (e.g., light harvesting complex in the plastid).

For each hypothetical protein gene, we queried ChlamBase to retrieve curated locus information, alternative gene names, and any community-or literature-derived annotations for the corresponding gene product (74). We also reviewed the corresponding UniProtKB entry to extract the current protein name, description, predicted features, and evidence context for functional annotations (75).
    > To incorporate experimentally supported information not captured in database summaries, we performed targeted PubMed searches using locus tags and commonly used aliases (e.g., CT_694, CTL_0360), as well as gene and protein name synonyms. When peer-reviewed studies provided direct experimental evidence (e.g., secretion via the type III secretion system, inclusion membrane localization, interaction partners, or phenotypes associated with targeted mutagenesis or knockdown), we used those findings to refine the functional description applied in this study
