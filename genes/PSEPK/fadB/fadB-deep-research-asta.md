## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88L02
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Fatty acid oxidation complex subunit alpha {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01621}; Includes: RecName: Full=Enoyl-CoA hydratase/Delta(3)-cis-Delta(2)-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase/3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA epimerase {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01621}; EC=4.2.1.17 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01621}; EC=5.1.2.3 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01621}; EC=5.3.3.8 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01621}; Includes: RecName: Full=3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01621}; EC=1.1.1.35 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01621};
- **Gene Information:** Name=fadB {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01621}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_2136;
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** In the C-terminal section; belongs to the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
- **Key Domains:** 3-OHacyl-CoA_DH_CS. (IPR006180); 3-OHacyl-CoA_DH_NAD-bd. (IPR006176); 3HC_DH_C. (IPR006108); 6-PGluconate_DH-like_C_sf. (IPR008927); ClpP/crotonase-like_dom_sf. (IPR029045)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "fadB" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'fadB' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **fadB** (gene ID: fadB, UniProt: Q88L02) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

- Summary: CRONOS, a cross-reference server that contains entries from five mammalian organisms presented by major gene and protein information resources, is developed, which shows that the cross-references are highly accurate.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.718)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > Gene nomenclature contains current official symbols and various numbers of synonyms, which pose a challenge to integrating genomic data and increase the probability that different genes share the same symbol. Therefore, we retrieved identifiers assigned to all protein-coding genes in human, mouse, rat and pig genomes that are available in the Ensembl genome browser (release 113) to assess the number of genes, compare species and identify ambiguous symbols. Results: Our analysis revealed that the total number of symbols, both official symbols and synonyms, used to identify protein-coding genes ranges from 16,600 in pigs to 64,580 in mice. Furthermore, the gene nomenclature is not complete because there are also genes without an assigned symbol, which indicates gaps in understanding protein-coding genes, especially in pigs. We also found a large number of gene symbols that map to more than one gene. These symbols might complicate the identification of about 10% of rat and mouse genes and 18% of human protein-coding genes. A simple solution for this problem is the usage of stable gene IDs assigned by scientific institutions and committees (Ensembl, NCBI, RGD, HGNC and VGNC) provided that the genomic information associated with these IDs is retrieved directly from proprietary databases containing the most accurate data. Finally, although gene symbols may pose a problem with unequivocal identification of genes, there are instances when no other identifiers are available in the literature. Therefore, we have developed an R script performing search of the Ensembl database and integrating data to provide a single list of updated symbols with annotation about their ambiguity. Conclusions: Gene symbols are not always reliable and should be reported together with stable IDs to enable unequivocal identification of genes. Therefore, data containing only gene symbols should be used cautiously to avoid misidentification of genes. A solution for this problem is our R script REgeness that performs a gene symbol update to current official versions combined with identification of ambiguous symbols and retrieval of other IDs from the Ensembl database.

    > In a basic workflow, the GOnet application receives a list of gene symbols, protein symbols, or protein IDs (UniProt IDs) as an input, and outputs a graph (an example given in Fig. 1). There are various input parameters which will affect the actual structure of the graph visualized and its appearance. The first main user choice is which GO terms the genes are annotated against:
    > 1. GO terms statistically significantly over-represented in the gene list submitted. 2. A predefined subset (also known as 'GO slim'), or a user-supplied list of terms.
    > In the first case the analysis will be referred to as an 'enrichment' analysis, in the second as an 'annotation' analysis.
    > Input parameters 1) Gene list. A mandatory input parameter containing the genes/proteins of interest. Currently human and mouse data is supported. An example of a human gene list might look like this:
    > Fig. 1 Sample network output generated by GOnet application. Gene differentially expressed in CD4 Bulk Memory T cells in Latent TB patients compared to healthy controls were used as an example [22] The gene list can also be accompanied with a contrast value. For example, This contrast value can be any decimal number, such as the log-fold change of gene expression between two conditions. This is merely a visualization enhancement. If the value is supplied it can be used later to differentially color specific genes in the graph (note different colors of gene nodes in Fig. 1), and visually indicate up-or down-regulation of specific genes and gene clusters.
    > The application can process common gene symbols (like in the example above), UniProt IDs, and MGI Accession IDs (mouse only). The former type of ID (gene symbols), although is the most human friendly, can unfortunately be ambiguous. For example, AIM1 can mean 'absent in melanoma' (also called CRYBG1) or 'Aurora and Ipl1-like midbody-associated protein' (also known as AURKB). Due to this ambiguity UniProt IDs or MGI accession IDs (for mouse) are preferred.
    > 2) GO namespace. Can be any of 'biological process', 'molecular function' or 'cellular component'.

    > The NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), include protein sequence information from GenBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), SwissProt, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and Protein Research Foundation (PRF). The NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) are the nucleotide sequence database that includes nucleotide sequence from GenBank of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as cell, organism and ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. KEGG is an established Cluster of Orthologous (KO) annotation system that can accomplish the function annotation of the genome/transcriptome of a newly sequenced species. SwissProt is a manual annotated and reviewed protein sequence database that has a high-quality protein sequence database from experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions. Pfam is comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile of hidden Markov models. Many proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of a specific structural domain possesses a certain degree of conservative property. GO is the established standard for the functional annotation of gene products and controlled vocabulary used to classify the functional attributes of gene products of a biological process, a molecular function and a cellular component.

    > The BLASTx homology search tool, a component of the standalone NCBI-blast-2.3.0+, was used to perform functional annotation of the F. udum genes (Altschul et al., 1990). With a cut-off E value of ≤1e−06 and a similarity of 34%, BLASTx identified the homologous sequences of the genes in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using Blast2GO PRO 4.1.5 (Conesa and Gotz, 2008). In three different mappings, B2G performed as follows: (1) Using two NCBI-provided mapping files, blast result accessions are used to get gene names (symbols; gene info, gene 2 accessions). (2) Blast result GI identifiers were used to retrieve UniProt IDs using a mapping file from PIR (non-redundant reference protein database), which includes PSD, Swiss-Prot, UniProt, TrEMBL, GenPept, RefSeq, and PDB. The names of the identified genes were searched in the species-specific entries of the gene product table of the GO database. With the aid of the KAAS-KEGG Automatic Annotation Server, pathway analyses were carried out. This database provides functional annotation of genes using other data servers (Moriya et al., 2007). Accessions from the blast results were looked for in the DBXRef table of the GO database.

    > ProteoSushi assigns each peptide to all proteins with a matching sequence in the userprovided FASTA proteome using the amino acid sequence of each modified peptide. Leucines and isoleucines, which are isobaric and can't be distinguished through mass spectrometry, are considered equivalent. Proteins in UniProt reference proteome are not equally likely studied and characterized resulting in a wide range of annotation quality and depth. Therefore, ProteoSushi compares the UniProt annotation scores of all matched proteins and annotates the peptide with the available information of those with the highest score (Supp. Fig. S1). This approach minimizes over-annotation and prioritizes assignment to better characterized proteins. This is especially useful for species that are not annotated well. The primary gene name assigned to the UniProt ID is used to assign the gene, and the modified residue(s) of the peptide are assigned to the amino acid number in the UniProt amino acid sequence.
    > ProteoSushi provides an option for a user-input list of gene names to prioritize identification to a specific subset of candidate proteins. Potential applications of this include organelle or protein complex enrichment prior to PTM enrichment, such as mitochondrial fractionation followed by enrichment for lysine acetylation 4 . In this case, the user can input a list of mitochondrial genes and ProteoSushi will prioritize assignment of peptides to these genes instead of cytoplasmic proteins that may have sequence homology. The ProteoSushi output indicates that the assigned proteins are in the target list to simplify follow-up analysis.
    > To compare how proteins and genes are assigned by ProteoSushi versus typical proteincentric database search software, the data output from MaxQuant were compared before and after ProteoSushi processing. A publicly available proteomic dataset that enriched and quantified the reversible oxidation of ~4,000 cysteines 29 was used for evaluation.

The UniProt database is divided into two sections: (i) UniProt/TrEMBL (which includes more sequence diversity but more annotation errors owing to homology-based annotations and error propagation Schnoes et al. [2009]) and (ii) UniProt/SwissProt (which is carefully curated and provides high confidence accurate functional annotations). For this study, we limited the data retrieved to prokaryotic organisms in SwissProt (May 2025) UniProt Consortium [2025].
    > We mapped UniProt/SwissProt accession numbers to corresponding identifiers in UniRef (Universal Protein Resource Reference Clusters) UniRef50, UniRef90, and UniRef100, which define protein clusters based on amino acid sequence identity at 50, 90, and 100 percent amino acid identity respectively; and to their corresponding EMBL CDS IDs for gene coding sequences in the ENA database Leinonen et al. [2010] using ID mapping files uni [2021], Wang et al. [2021] from UniProtKB. Each EMBL CDS ID's corresponding DNA sequence was then obtained from ENA. EC numbers that were either incomplete or missing were removed from the dataset. Individual entries were created for UniProt records with more than one EMBL CDS ID in the nucleotide version of the dataset.

All proteins were then classified into 3 groups: molecular function, cellular component and biological process.

    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > As a result of the GO Consortium annotation effort, the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) database b has become a large and comprehensive resource for proteomics research [18]. The database provides structured annotations to non-redundant proteins from many species in UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) [19] using standardized GO vocabularies through a combination of electronic and manual techniques. The large-scale assignment of GO terms to UniProtKB entries (or accession numbers) was done by converting a proportion of the existing knowledge held within the UniProKB database into GO terms [18]. The GO annotation database also includes a series of cross-references to other databases. Thus, the systematic integration of GO annotations and UniProtKB database can be exploited for subcellular localization. Specifically, given the accession number of a protein, a set of GO terms can be retrieved from the GO annotation database file c . In UniProKB, each protein has an accession number, and in the GO annotation database, each accession number may be associated with zero, one or more distinct GO terms. Conversely, one GO term may be associated with zero, one, or many different accession numbers. This means that the mappings between accession numbers and GO terms are many-to-many.

To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > The Gene Ontology (GO) is a controlled vocabulary for uniformly describing gene products in terms of biological processes, cellular components and molecular function across all organisms [46]. It has been shown that GO terms can be used to improve the performance of subcellular protein localization prediction methods [47,48]. In the literature to date, there are three possibilities for obtaining GO annotation terms for a query sequence. If the UniProt [49] accession number is known, one can simply extract the GO annotation from the UniProt database [50]. However, this procedure fails for novel proteins without accession number. Another possibility is to search for homologous proteins annotated with GO terms using BLAST [28,29]. This becomes difficult in cases where proteins have no close homolog or proteins have many homologs, because no GO term can be obtained or GO terms might be ambiguous. A further method of inferring GO terms is InterProScan [51] used, for example, by Chou and Cai [52]. Given a protein sequence, the tool scans against various pattern and signature data sources collected by the InterPro project [53]. InterPro also provides a mapping of the detected protein domains and functional sites to GO terms.
    > Our subpredictor GOLoc is based on GO terms calculated using InterProScan. Since the GO terms are derived directly from the query sequence, we avoid the drawbacks of using accession numbers or BLAST. The input of GOLoc is a binary-coded vector which represents all GO terms of the training sequences (see Fig. 2). GO terms present in the query sequence are set to 1 in the vector and to 0 otherwise [see Additional file 1].

Protein sequences of orthologous genes can be obtained from UniProt (The UniProt, 2017). Ones from Swiss-Port have been reviewed and thus are of higher quality. Transcriptome assembly may be available from previous studies or can be assembled de novo from RNA-seq reads by Trinity (Haas et al., 2013). High quality transcriptome assembly can be selected as described in (Zhang et al., 2021). Note: Details about gene structure annotation (Holt and Yandell, 2011) can be found at http:// gmod.org/wiki/MAKER_Tutorial, https://darencard.net/blog/2017-05-16-maker-genomeannotation/, and the protocol (Campbell et al., 2014).
    > b. Quality measurement and functional annotation.
    > For each predicted gene, Maker2 provides the annotation edit distance (AED) score, which measures the goodness of fit between its predicted gene structure and its evidence support. The lower the score, the more accurate the prediction. If more than 90% genes with AED scores lower than 0.5, the genome can be considered well annotated. In addition to the AED score, a high proportion of recognizable domains contained in predicted protein -e.g., higher than 50% -also indicates a good annotation. Recognizable protein domains can by scanned by InterProScan (Jones et al., 2014), assigning potential function to predicted genes.
    > Note: Besides the aforementioned quality measurement, we strongly recommend measuring the completeness of the genome assembly and annotation by checking the existence of a set of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) (Simao et al., 2015). A high-level completeness of genome assembly and annotation is imperative for a better identification of gene expansion. Based on the result of this analysis, researchers can decide whether they need to further improve the genome assembly before predicting gene expansion. A detailed protocol of BUSCO is available at
