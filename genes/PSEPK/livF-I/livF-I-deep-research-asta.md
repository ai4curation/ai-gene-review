## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88NR8
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=High-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport ATP-binding protein {ECO:0000256|PIRNR:PIRNR039137};
- **Gene Information:** Name=livF-I {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66762.1}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_1137 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN66762.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ABC transporter superfamily.
- **Key Domains:** AAA+_ATPase. (IPR003593); ABC_branched_ATPase_LivF/BraG. (IPR030660); ABC_transporter-like_ATP-bd. (IPR003439); ABC_transporter-like_CS. (IPR017871); BCAA_Transport_ATP-bd_LivF. (IPR052156)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "livF-I" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'livF-I' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **livF-I** (gene ID: livF-I, UniProt: Q88NR8) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

First, the identified protein identity was converted to UniProt identity and then mapped to GO identity based on the protein identity. When the identified protein was not annotated by UniProt-GOA, the functional annotation of that protein was conducted using the InterProScan software according to the amino acid sequence alignment approach. All proteins were then classified into 3 groups: molecular function, cellular component and biological process.

    > Table 3 lists the Genbank accession number, the gene symbols, accession number in UniProtKB (UniProt Knowledgebase), and gene descriptions given by colon data. The UniProtKB is the central hub for the collection of information on proteins such as amino acid sequence, protein name or description, taxonomic data, and biological ontology [24]. Figure 6 depicts gene expression profiles of the eight genes in normal and disease samples. As shown in Figure 6, the profiles of these genes are highly coexpressed in normal samples (samples 1-22) while the coexpression pattern disappears in disease samples (samples 23-62).

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

The KRAS gene encoding GTPase protein consisting of 189 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 21.6 kDa was recovered from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the RCSB-PDB ID: 7SCW, which has a resolution of 1.98 Å. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) ( https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7SCW/pdb) is a crucial resource for studying the 3D structures, aiding research and education in many fields 20 .

    > To get comprehensive gene function of rambai genes, gene annotation to seven databases, namely National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein sequences (NR), NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome Ortholog (KO), SwissProt, Protein family (Pfam), Gene Ontology (GO) and Cluster of Orthologous Groups (KOG), was used as reference.
    > The NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), include protein sequence information from GenBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), SwissProt, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and Protein Research Foundation (PRF). The NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) are the nucleotide sequence database that includes nucleotide sequence from GenBank of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as cell, organism and ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. KEGG is an established Cluster of Orthologous (KO) annotation system that can accomplish the function annotation of the genome/transcriptome of a newly sequenced species. SwissProt is a manual annotated and reviewed protein sequence database that has a high-quality protein sequence database from experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions. Pfam is comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile of hidden Markov models. Many proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of a specific structural domain possesses a certain degree of conservative property. GO is the established standard for the functional annotation of gene products and controlled vocabulary used to classify the functional attributes of gene products of a biological process, a molecular function and a cellular component.

    > Further KEGG and GO annotations were performed on the genes with NR annotation in the genome. The genome proteins were blasted against Swiss-Prot databases to obtain uniprot accession numbers using the Blastp algorithm with an E-value cutoff set at 1e −5 . Meanwhile, the amino acid sequences of novel predicted genes were blasted against both the NR and Swiss-Prot databases to obtain refseq accession numbers and uniprot accession numbers using the Blastp algorithm with an E-value cutoff set at 1e −5 . The UniProt accession number was used for annotation with Gene Ontology (GO). Additionally, the genome proteins were blasted against the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases (https://www.genome.jp/tools/ kaas/). ClusterProfiler was applied to identify the significant GO categories, and the adjusted qvalue was used to correct the qvalue. We selected the significant terms (qvalue<0.05) according to enrichment analysis based on the up, down, and all differentially expressed genes to summarise the functions affected in the experiment. Pathway analysis was used to determine the significant pathways of the genes according to the KEGG database. We used ClusterProfiler to select the significant pathway, and the threshold of significance was defined according to qvalue and adjusted qvalue. We selected the significant pathway (qvalue<0.05) according to the enrichment analysis based on the up, down, and all differentially expressed genes to summarise the functions affected in the experiment.

- Summary: Experimental and computational criteria suggest that most genes whose expression is affected by the Leu3 genotype are unlikely to be regulated by binding of the protein, and the unusually direct nature of the perturbations investigated.

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.678)
    > The expression levels of nearly all the classically defined targets of Leu3 are affected by both LEU3 deletion and Leu3 over-expression. Indeed, the seven genes that comprise the pathway for branched amino acid biosynthesis are among the most strongly regulated genes under each condition (Fig 5). This suggests that the primary physiological targets can largely be identified from either deletion of the transcription factor or its overexpression. On the other hand, GO analysis and the conservation of predicted binding potential both suggest that authentic target genes can be responsive to only one of the perturbations. This is illustrated well by a set of permeases and transport proteins that are bound and regulated by Leu3. As noted above, "organic acid transport" is the second most significant functional annotation among the 54 genes that are bound and regulated (p < 4e-4), with a total for four genes Leu3 targets inferred from at least one combination of ChIP and expression analyses Figure 3 Leu3 targets inferred from at least one combination of ChIP and expression analyses. Genes are grouped according to the combinations of experiments that support the identification of the as a Leu3 target. Shaded portions of columns identify the genes that are significantly bound or regulated under the indicated experimental condition (low or high activity). The two columns labeled "GO" show the genes whose Gene Ontology process annotations are enriched at the indicated confidence levels (1e-3 or 1e-8). Annotations are shown for all genes found with GO annotations enriched with p-value better than 0.05. If more than one annotation was enriched, the most significant annotation is shown. The GO annotation "branched chain family amino acid biosynthesis" has been abbreviated to "branched amino acid biosynthesis".

Genes that are bound and regulated according to at least one combination of low or high activity expression and low or high ChIP analysis were subjected to GO process analysis, yielding 17 genes with enriched annotations.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > The database enables searching by gene symbols/names, GenBank accession numbers, UniGene cluster IDs, Swiss-Prot entry names and several unique clone IDs (IMAGE clone IDs, University of Iowa clone IDs, Operon oligo IDs, TAIR IDs and a subset of selected Affymetrix and Agilent IDs).
    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > ProteoSushi assigns each peptide to all proteins with a matching sequence in the userprovided FASTA proteome using the amino acid sequence of each modified peptide. Leucines and isoleucines, which are isobaric and can't be distinguished through mass spectrometry, are considered equivalent. Proteins in UniProt reference proteome are not equally likely studied and characterized resulting in a wide range of annotation quality and depth. Therefore, ProteoSushi compares the UniProt annotation scores of all matched proteins and annotates the peptide with the available information of those with the highest score (Supp. Fig. S1). This approach minimizes over-annotation and prioritizes assignment to better characterized proteins. This is especially useful for species that are not annotated well. The primary gene name assigned to the UniProt ID is used to assign the gene, and the modified residue(s) of the peptide are assigned to the amino acid number in the UniProt amino acid sequence.
    > ProteoSushi provides an option for a user-input list of gene names to prioritize identification to a specific subset of candidate proteins. Potential applications of this include organelle or protein complex enrichment prior to PTM enrichment, such as mitochondrial fractionation followed by enrichment for lysine acetylation 4 . In this case, the user can input a list of mitochondrial genes and ProteoSushi will prioritize assignment of peptides to these genes instead of cytoplasmic proteins that may have sequence homology. The ProteoSushi output indicates that the assigned proteins are in the target list to simplify follow-up analysis.
    > To compare how proteins and genes are assigned by ProteoSushi versus typical proteincentric database search software, the data output from MaxQuant were compared before and after ProteoSushi processing. A publicly available proteomic dataset that enriched and quantified the reversible oxidation of ~4,000 cysteines 29 was used for evaluation.

    > We used NGS-SNP [25] for functional annotation of identified SNPs and indels. The details of the resulting annotation fields have been described by Grant et al. [25]. Briefly, NGS-SNP provides rich annotations for genome-wide SNP and indels in organisms for which reference sequences are available in the Ensembl database. It reports a "Model_Annotations" field with detailed comparisons of SNP/indel to an orthologous gene typically in a well-characterized species. NGS-SNP also classifies whether or not the amino acid change is deleterious based on SIFT [56] prediction. Other important fields include overlapping protein features or domains, gene ontology information, and the conservation of both the SNP site and flanking sequence compared to a well-characterized species. NGS-SNP also reports NCBI, Ensembl, and UniProt IDs for genes, transcripts, and proteins when applicable. A gene description, phenotypes linked to the gene and whether the SNP/indel is novel or known is also supplemented in the annotated field. In our analysis, NGS-SNP utilized information from Ensembl release 72 [57], dbSNP Build 133 [58], Entrez Gene [58] and UniProt release 2013_09 [59]. We incorporated Homo sapiens as the model species for sequence conservation during annotation because most of the eukaryotic genes are well characterized in human.

    > The UniProt accession identification of target kinases was converted to gene symbols for humans using the SynGO gene set analysis tool (Koopmans et al., 2019), and pooled together, and submitted to GeneMANIA to construct target kinase network. GeneMANIA is a handy web interface for acquiring gene ontology, scrutinizing gene lists, and highlighting genes for functional assays (Warde-Farley et al., 2010). After choosing Homo sapiens from the list of optional organisms, the genes of interest in the previous step were entered into the search bar and the results were collated and high-scored genes were culled for further discussion. Moreover, the protein-protein network was also constructed in STRING ver. 12 launched at https://string-db.org, and submitted to Cytoscape ver. 3.10.2 for network analysis using a novel Cytoscape plugin cytoHubba and visualization (Shannon et al. , 2003).
