## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88QK7
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=UvrABC system protein A {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00205}; Short=UvrA protein {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00205}; AltName: Full=Excinuclease ABC subunit A {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00205};
- **Gene Information:** Name=uvrA {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00205}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_0483;
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ABC transporter superfamily. UvrA family.
- **Key Domains:** ABC_transporter-like_ATP-bd. (IPR003439); ABC_transporter-like_CS. (IPR017871); ATP_grasp_subdomain_1. (IPR013815); P-loop_NTPase. (IPR027417); UvrA. (IPR004602)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "uvrA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'uvrA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **uvrA** (gene ID: uvrA, UniProt: Q88QK7) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

- Year: 2020
- Venue: Journal of Food Science and Engineering
- URL: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f99fe2940881ec45ecbd8ba3da7f10b4fb22fc3b
- DOI: 10.17265/2159-5828/2020.02.001
- Summary: Baccaurea motleyana (rambai) is underutilized fruits that are native to Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand and used for simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis by MIcroSAtellite (MISA).
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.788)
    > To get comprehensive gene function of rambai genes, gene annotation to seven databases, namely National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein sequences (NR), NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome Ortholog (KO), SwissProt, Protein family (Pfam), Gene Ontology (GO) and Cluster of Orthologous Groups (KOG), was used as reference.
    > The NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), include protein sequence information from GenBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), SwissProt, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and Protein Research Foundation (PRF). The NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) are the nucleotide sequence database that includes nucleotide sequence from GenBank of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as cell, organism and ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. KEGG is an established Cluster of Orthologous (KO) annotation system that can accomplish the function annotation of the genome/transcriptome of a newly sequenced species. SwissProt is a manual annotated and reviewed protein sequence database that has a high-quality protein sequence database from experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions. Pfam is comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile of hidden Markov models. Many proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of a specific structural domain possesses a certain degree of conservative property. GO is the established standard for the functional annotation of gene products and controlled vocabulary used to classify the functional attributes of gene products of a biological process, a molecular function and a cellular component.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

### [3] CRONOS: the cross-reference navigation server
- Authors: Brigitte Waegele, I. Dunger, G. Fobo, Corinna Montrone, H. Mewes et al.

- Summary: CRONOS, a cross-reference server that contains entries from five mammalian organisms presented by major gene and protein information resources, is developed, which shows that the cross-references are highly accurate.
- Evidence snippets:
  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.766)
    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > We defined the subcellular localization for each protein in the human proteome by integrating data from Gene Ontology annotations in UniProt (GOA), UniProt annotations, the Human Transmembrane Proteome (HTP) 121 , MatrixDB 122 , and MatrisomeDB 123 . We divided the UniProt and the Gene Ontology annotations (GOA) into tier 1 (more reliable) and tier 2 (less reliable) annotations, depending on the attached evidence codes. For UniProt, annotations with the evidence codes ECO:0000269 or ECO:0000305 are considered as tier 1, while annotations with evidence codes ECO:0000250, ECO:0000255, or ECO:0000303 are tier 2. For Gene Ontology, annotations with evidence codes IDA, IMP, IPI, IGI, EXP, IBA, IKR, TAS, NAS, IC, or ND are tier 1, while annotations with evidence codes HDA, ISS, ISA, RCA, ISO, ISM, IGC, or IEA are tier 2. Based on these, each protein was assigned exactly one broad localization. It was considered to be a transmembrane protein (TMP), if it is assigned the 'integral component of membrane (GO:0016021)' GO term in tier 1 GOA annotations, or it is annotated as a TMP in HTP with a confidence score over 85, or is annotated in HTP as a TMP with a confidence score above 50 and is also annotated as a TMP in GOA (either tier).

    > Whole-genome sequencing has enabled investigations into the gene content of living many organisms and forms the foundation for further study of gene expression, proteomics and epigenetics. After assembly of a novel genome, gene annotation is often the first step in analysing the gene content of an organism. Accurate annotation of the exonic structure of genes is crucial to the success of all subsequent functional and comparative analyses.
    > Problems that can potentially be caused by incorrect gene annotation are numerous and can lead to incorrect assessments of the lifestyle and ecology of an organism. In comparative genomics where orthologous genes or conserved functional domains are compared between species/isolates, the estimated numbers of such genes/ domains can be distorted by less than perfect annotations (as described by Hane et al. [1], S Text 1). Prediction of extracellular secretion, which can be determined by a short signal peptide at the N-terminus, can miss secreted proteins if the start codon of a gene has been incorrectly annotated. Mis-annotating the start of protein translation could either cut off the signal peptide or bury it within the annotation. While a seemingly benign annotation error, the consequences for downstream research could be detrimental, particularly as the biotic interactions or industrial applications of microbes are largely determined by their secretomes. Additionally, translated protein sequences of novel species are often submitted to databases such as NCBI [2] and Uniprot [3]. It is commonplace to use these database entries to support the annotation of related species or isolates, meaning errors present in the pioneer annotation may be repeated. When these new annotations based on false assumptions are added to databases, there is not only a propagation of errors, but also a perceived strengthening of homology evidence for incorrect protein sequences.
    > In recent years, correction of in silico predicted gene annotations with RNA-seq derived transcripts and read alignments has enabled vastly improved genome annotations and corrections of annotated gene structures [4][5][6].

    > As previously described (Triant et al. 2020), once a proteincoding gene annotation is complete, each new or modified isoform should be compared to a well-curated protein sequence database to check for congruency with known proteins. The sequence of an annotation is obtained by right clicking it and selecting Get Sequence. The first choice of database to search is the well-curated UniProtKB/Swissprot database using BLAST at either the UniProt (https:// www. unipr ot. org/ blast) or NCBI website (https:// blast. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ Blast. cgi) (Sayers et al. 2023a;UniProt Consortium 2023). If there is no match with a significant e-value (< 1e−05) in UniProtKB/Swissprot, the next database to try is the Model Organisms (landmark) database at NCBI. If that fails, select the RefSeq Proteins database and exclude your organism of interest from the search. Although RefSeq includes computationally predicted and hypothetical proteins, an alignment to a homologous protein from another organism provides support for the annotation. An alignment that covers the full length of both the annotated protein and the database protein sequence suggests the annotation is correct. An alignment that encompasses the full length of an annotated protein sequence but only part of a database protein suggests that the annotation is truncated. You may be able to correct the annotation with additional evidence, but if there is not sufficient evidence the issue can be noted in the Annotation Information Panel under the Comment tab. A partial alignment of an annotated protein to a database protein suggests the annotation has a reading frame shift or was extended incorrectly. Aligning the coding sequence (CDS) to the protein database will reveal whether the problem is due to a reading frame shift. Further annotation editing should be performed to correct the reading frame. If an incorrect extension was due to the merging of two genes, you should edit or redo the annotation. Any unresolved issues should be entered in the Comment section of the Annotation Information Panel.

    > During the annotation phase of a typical modern genomics project, functional names are assigned to identified genes and proteins in an automated or semiautomated fashion. Ideally, before such names are submitted to public sequence databases, they should be manually reviewed by experts to ensure that they are consistent, syntactically correct and unambiguous. However, with the scale of genomic data produced by next-generation sequencing technology and with increasingly automated functional annotation processes, the manual correction of names is no longer feasible. This issue is further complicated by the prevalence of ambiguous names resulting from the lack of interspecies naming conventions (1). New proteins are often named based on homology to existing proteins and many existing proteins have syntactically incorrect or ambiguous names, producing transitive annotation errors. Consequently, poor-quality names have proliferated in both public databases and the scientific literature.
    > The need for consistent and unambiguous names has led to the development of a number of conventions for naming genes and proteins [UniProt protein nomenclature (2), HUGO human gene name nomenclature (3) and various other model organism databases (4)(5)(6)(7)]. In addition, the biological text mining community has created dictionaries to resolve gene/protein synonyms to improve the identification of genes and proteins in scientific articles (1,8).
    > The Broad Institute has developed BioNames, a tool to resolve these difficulties using collections of hard-coded regular expressions (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ microbiomeutil). Here, we present our solution to this problem in the form of the Protein Naming Utility (PNU), a web-based database to store and apply customizable sets of naming rules to correct and standardize gene and protein names within an annotated genome or metagenome. The database provides an intuitive web interface that allows users to create and maintain their own naming rules and organize these rules in projects that can be shared with the community.

    > Protein-coding gene annotation is typically a two-step process. Initially, Prodigal is employed to identify open reading frames (ORFs) by locating gene coordinates, but it does not infer gene function. To assign putative functions, Prokka performs hierarchical annotation by comparing candidate genes to curated protein databases. It begins with a user-supplied, high-confidence protein set, using BLAST+ for sequence similarity searches. If no match is found, it progresses to UniProt's verified bacterial proteins, covering \~ 16,000 sequences, and then optionally to RefSeq proteins specific to the organism's genuscapturing nomenclature consistency. When sequence-based annotation fails, Prokka applies profile-based searches using HMMER's hmmscan to query against Pfam and TIGRFAMs databases. An e-value threshold of 10 −6 is consistently applied to ensure significance. If no reliable match is found across all levels, the gene is designated as a "hypothetical protein. " This layered strategy maximizes annotation accuracy and functional insight across diverse bacterial genomes (Seemann, 2014).

Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.

Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions.

    > The BLASTx homology search tool, a component of the standalone NCBI-blast-2.3.0+, was used to perform functional annotation of the F. udum genes (Altschul et al., 1990). With a cut-off E value of ≤1e−06 and a similarity of 34%, BLASTx identified the homologous sequences of the genes in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using Blast2GO PRO 4.1.5 (Conesa and Gotz, 2008). In three different mappings, B2G performed as follows: (1) Using two NCBI-provided mapping files, blast result accessions are used to get gene names (symbols; gene info, gene 2 accessions). (2) Blast result GI identifiers were used to retrieve UniProt IDs using a mapping file from PIR (non-redundant reference protein database), which includes PSD, Swiss-Prot, UniProt, TrEMBL, GenPept, RefSeq, and PDB. The names of the identified genes were searched in the species-specific entries of the gene product table of the GO database. With the aid of the KAAS-KEGG Automatic Annotation Server, pathway analyses were carried out. This database provides functional annotation of genes using other data servers (Moriya et al., 2007). Accessions from the blast results were looked for in the DBXRef table of the GO database.

    > Although this is a fairly obvious requirement, it is not trivial to implement because a protein reagent expressed recombinantly is typically not the exact same entity or in the same state as its corresponding assay participant in a living cell (e.g., kinase domain binding assay vs. corresponding kinase occurring in a specific cell line used for a growth inhibition assay). In this first version of metadata standards, we take a rudimentary approach. We use the UniProt accession and approved Gene symbol (NCBI Gene) and accession number to identify and reference proteins and their coding genes, respectively. Although we recognize limitations, for the purpose of our current simple use cases, this is sufficient. Linking protein and gene identifiers in addition is relevant to integrate RNAi reagent gene targets (see below). The recommended explicit fields for proteins include a standardized name, both for the protein and the gene that encodes it; source of protein (e.g., chemically synthesized, purified from natural source, recombinantly expressed); protein modifications (e.g., mutations, posttranslational modification); protein purity; subunit information for components of a protein complex; and isoform information (derived from either alternative promoter usage, alternative splicing, alternative translation initiation, or frame shifting). We are currently working on a formal description of proteins that will allow ambiguity (more-or less-specific definition of proteins), because in some cases, the exact entity and state of a protein reagent or model system participant is not definitively known (full length, functional domain, exact sequence, mutation, phosphorylation state, etc.).

When the identified protein was not annotated by UniProt-GOA, the functional annotation of that protein was conducted using the InterProScan software according to the amino acid sequence alignment approach. All proteins were then classified into 3 groups: molecular function, cellular component and biological process.
