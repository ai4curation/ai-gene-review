## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88PA9
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Dual-action ribosomal maturation protein DarP {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00765}; AltName: Full=Large ribosomal subunit assembly factor DarP {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00765};
- **Gene Information:** Name=darP {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00765}; OrderedLocusNames=PP_0941;
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the DarP family. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-
- **Key Domains:** DarP. (IPR006839); DarP_sf. (IPR023153); DarP (PF04751)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "darP" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'darP' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **darP** (gene ID: darP, UniProt: Q88PA9) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > However, the peaks were in different positions within the gene in the four individual experiments performed (Fig. 6), and no specific binding site within the mRNA could be identified from the data.
    > Among the genes identified were numerous genes related to protein biosynthesis (tRNAs, tRNA-aminoacyl synthetases, tRNA-modifying enzymes, ribosomal proteins). As an example, genes for ribosomal proteins were highly represented with 18 out of the 22 genes (82%) for small ribosomal proteins, (12 after cold shock, 55%), and 31 out of 34 genes (91%) for large ribosomal subunit proteins (22 after cold shock, 65%). Other protein families represented were chaperones (e.g., dnaK, dnaJ, grpE, but not dafA, groES, groEL, clpB), cold-shock and general stress proteins (TT_RS08235, _09210; hsp22, hsp30; uspA), topoisomerase genes (gyrA, gyrB, topA), genes for transporters and their subunits (often both the gene for the substrate-bind-ing protein and for the permease, for example, branchedchain amino acid ABC transporter, TT_RS01115 and _01120), and genes related to sugar-and cell wall metabolism and cell division, as well as CRISPR-related genes. In many cases, genes for all subunits of protein complexes (e.g., genes for cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II; clpA, clpX coding for the ClpAX protease) were present.
    > A systematic gene ontology analysis using the DAVID server 6.7 (https://david-d.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) (Huang da et al. 2009a,b) with the consolidated gene lists for Hera1/Hera2, and Hera3/Hera4, translated into UniProt accession numbers, revealed three annotation clusters with significant enrichment (Supplemental Table 4a,b).

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > In transcriptomics and proteomics studies, one important step of data analysis is the functional annotation of obtained lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or proteins (DEPs). With the increase in the number of organisms with sequenced and annotated genomes, such studies have been performed in many different species. However, the information about gene and protein functions, on which the annotation is based, is mainly derived from a limited number of model organisms or well-annotated species, such as mouse, humans and rat representing mammalian species or even from bacteria, yeast, worms or Drosophila. Based on the assumption that orthologous genes carry out identical or biologically equivalent functions in different organisms, functional annotation is transferred from wellstudied organisms to less well-annotated species (1). Whereas orthologous genes usually have maintained the same function during evolution (2) paralogous genes originated from gene duplication events and often evolved different functions (3,4). Orthologous genes usually have the same gene symbol and name for almost all corresponding species (5, 6). However, depending on the status of the gene annotation of a species, not all annotated genes have an official gene symbol (only locus number, e.g. LOC100152218 60S ribosomal protein L23a-like) and/or are assigned to functional annotation databases like their corresponding orthologs in the well-annotated model organisms. This leads to a substantial loss of information if the gene identifiers (IDs) of the respective species are used for functional annotation. To avoid this data loss and improve the results of functional annotation, one strategy is to transfer information from homologous genes (orthologs and paralogs) of well-annotated species (6).
    > In many situations with non-model species such as livestock species, experimentalists avoid the additional work to assign human ortholog genes for functional annotation analysis and are not aware of the information loss.

The predicted CDSs were translated and used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information non-redundant database, UniProt, TIGR-Fam, Pfam, KEGG, COG, and InterPro database. These data sources were combined to assert a product description for each predicted protein. tRNAScanSE was used to find tRNA genes and rRNA genes were found using searches against models of the ribosomal RNA genes built from SIVLA [20,21].
    > Additional gene prediction analysis and functional annotation was performed within the IMG-ER platform [22,23]. For each gene discussed in this publication, the annotation was manually checked against the Gen-Bank® databased manual searches using the BLASTn and BLASTp algorithms -both of the gene from T. tepidarius and using the equivalent gene from members of the Acidithiobacillia or Escherichia coli.

    > Genome annotation was performed following established guidelines (Haas et al. 2011 (Slater & Birney 2005). Predicted gene models exhibiting strong evidence by exon alignment were exported as protein sequences and coding nucleotide sequences (CDS). Predicted gene models lacking evidence from exon alignment were discarded in downstream analyses. To determine function, the protein sequences were used as input for InterProScan 5RC6 (Jones et al. 2014) (parameters: -dp -f -t p -iprlookup -pa -goterms) and were also compared to the manually curated protein data set from UniProt/Swiss-Prot by blastp v. 2.2.28+. The results in XML format from blastp v. 2.2.28+ and InterProScan were loaded into Blast2GO v. 2.7.1 (Conesa et al. 2005) and merged to create an annotation table (available from the first author on request). The gene models with BLAST hits having e-value of less than 1.0E -100 and mean similarity hit of ≥ 70% were assumed to be orthologs and they were given names following recommended conventions (http:// www.uniprot.org/docs/proknameprot). Ribosomal RNA's were predicted by RNAmmer v. 1.2 (Lagesen et al. 2007).

    > Protein-coding gene annotation is typically a two-step process. Initially, Prodigal is employed to identify open reading frames (ORFs) by locating gene coordinates, but it does not infer gene function. To assign putative functions, Prokka performs hierarchical annotation by comparing candidate genes to curated protein databases. It begins with a user-supplied, high-confidence protein set, using BLAST+ for sequence similarity searches. If no match is found, it progresses to UniProt's verified bacterial proteins, covering \~ 16,000 sequences, and then optionally to RefSeq proteins specific to the organism's genuscapturing nomenclature consistency. When sequence-based annotation fails, Prokka applies profile-based searches using HMMER's hmmscan to query against Pfam and TIGRFAMs databases. An e-value threshold of 10 −6 is consistently applied to ensure significance. If no reliable match is found across all levels, the gene is designated as a "hypothetical protein. " This layered strategy maximizes annotation accuracy and functional insight across diverse bacterial genomes (Seemann, 2014).
    > The genome of coliphage ASEC2201 has been analyzed and three holin protein coding genes were selected. The sequences of all three holin proteins were retrieved from NCBI using accession no. SRX17770782 in the FASTA format. The sequence similarity search was performed via BLAST against the non-redundant database (Altschul et al., 1990).

Given the low amount of functional (GO) annotation in our largest assembly, C. shasta þ NHP (see Results), we used BlastX to search for homologs of genes of interest in two custom concatenated databases that comprised the Cell Migration Knowledge Database (CMKB) which includes proteins, families, and complexes involved in cell migration (http://www.cellmigration. org/index.shtml, last accessed February 5, 2015; $7,600 protein sequences), and the MEROPS database, which consists of a nr library of full-length sequences of peptidases and peptidase inhibitors (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/, last accessed December 2, 2014; $450,000 sequences; Rawlings et al. 2016). We searched using the longest representatives for each gene in the C. shasta þ NHP assembly (23,418 contigs; IIR-RBT6) then parsed matches (bit score > 100) and posteriorly classified homologs to proteases or motility genes matching the specific databases. We then selected only genes with the same annotation in UniProt (determined using the same standards: no ambiguous terms filtering, bit score > 100) to confirm gene identity. Due to disagreements between annotations (CMKB vs. UniProt, and MEROPS vs. UniProt), we curated gene lists manually, removing genes that matched one or more of the following criteria: 1) no genetic distances available (only available for reference); 2) disagreements between annotations from the different databases, after checking for synonyms or function similarity; 3) annotations that contained terms from UniProt "Uncharacterized protein" and "Predicted protein" (ambiguous terms), and whose identity could not be confirmed; and 4) annotations that contained nonspecific terms, such as "heat shock protein" or "ribosomal protein."

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

Gene pairs were formed within or between the functional/evolutionarilydefined groups of genes that are under investigation here. (a) Correlation within all yeast genes. (b) Correlation within genes that do not encode nucleolar proteins. (c) Correlation within genes for nucleolar proteins. (d) Correlation within genes for ribosomal or ribosome-associated proteins.

(g) Correlation within genes that encode 90S processosome components. (h) Correlation between genes for ribosome proteins and 90S processosome proteins. Note that the distributions for the ribosomal protein genes and the 90S processosome strongly deviate from the rather 0-centered distribution of 'all genes-versus-all gene' comparisons. However, the distribution for gene pairs in which one partner is a 90S processosome component and the other partner is a ribosomal component deviate much less from the random shape and, thus, indicate distinct expression programs.
    > Genome Biology 2006, 7:R98 We applied the 'best reciprocal hit' (BRH) method to find orthologous protein pairs between the reference proteome and a target proteome. The BRH method is an approximative method for ortholog identification that has been applied by many other groups before to identify orthologs for pairs of organisms with considerable accuracy (see, for example, [61][62][63][64][65]. The BRH method performs worse than more sophisticated phylogeny-based techniques (like reconciliation of phylogenetic and species tree), but, because of its simplicity, it is especially suited for phylogenetic profiling of proteomes of dozens of organisms.

    > The E. coli K-12 Reference Proteome and Data Sources-Two databases Uniprot (29) and EcoLOCATION (32) and the proposed IM proteome (33) were the main initial starting points for the complete subcellular categorization of K-12 described here. The E. coli K-12/ MG1655 strain is one of the microbial proteomes whose comprehensive annotation is of the highest priority in Uniprot (29). This is the "reference proteome" for E. coli, contains 4303 proteins, and has been annotated here. Our annotation has been formulated in such a way that it can be easily incorporated in Uniprot.
    > EchoLOCATION has an easily accessible table that maps gene names to subcellular locations. However, mapping the gene names given by EchoLOCATION to the respective protein identifiers in Uniprot was not straightforward. Unfortunately, gene names cannot serve as unique identifiers of a protein sequence. In more than 100 cases the gene name of a predicted protein in EchoLOCATION when searched against Uniprot gave as a result more than one K-12 protein hits. That is because there are proteins that have common synonymous gene names with the primary gene name of others.
    > To retrieve updated Uniprot accession identifiers and to map Uniprot accessions identifiers to EchoLOCATION identifiers (termed: EchoBASE IDs) we used the "ID mapping" function of Uniprot. In cases where the only provided identifiers were the gene names, we used mySQL queries to compare with the primary and alternative gene names in Uniprot. In cases where multiple matches existed for the same gene name, we manually resolved the differences based on other information (e.g. protein description, mass etc.).
    > The annotation of pseudogenes, mobile elements, transposons, and insertion elements relied on EcoGene (34), Uniprot (29), and Ochman et al. (35). The list of E. coli K-12 complexes was retrieved from EcoCyc (31) and literature searches.

    > The NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), include protein sequence information from GenBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), SwissProt, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and Protein Research Foundation (PRF). The NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) are the nucleotide sequence database that includes nucleotide sequence from GenBank of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as cell, organism and ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially for large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies. KEGG is an established Cluster of Orthologous (KO) annotation system that can accomplish the function annotation of the genome/transcriptome of a newly sequenced species. SwissProt is a manual annotated and reviewed protein sequence database that has a high-quality protein sequence database from experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions. Pfam is comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and as profile of hidden Markov models. Many proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of a specific structural domain possesses a certain degree of conservative property. GO is the established standard for the functional annotation of gene products and controlled vocabulary used to classify the functional attributes of gene products of a biological process, a molecular function and a cellular component.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > However, this name does not allow one to discriminate between small and large subunit proteins and thus may be misleading. For example, Mrp2 is not the homologue of the prokaryotic S2 ribosomal proteins but belongs to the S14p family. Accordingly, we preferred to designate the newly identified genes RSMxx genes, where RSM stands for ribosomal small subunit of mitochondria, and xx is the number of the corresponding prokaryotic protein family (see Table II). The genes that encode proteins that are not significantly similar to prokaryotic proteins were named with the same prefix RSM followed by a number that begins with 22, because there are 21 prokaryotic small ribosomal subunit protein families. Thus, the proposed name of the YKL155c gene is RSM22 (Table II). The matched peptide has the sequence VT-PGSLYK. The differences between the masses of the marked peaks correspond to the masses of amino acid residues Gly, Pro, and Thr. D, the fragmentation spectrum for the peptide that is found within residues 400 -408 in the predicted sequence of Ygl129c shows a very good signal-to-noise ratio. Fragmentation spectra that were generated for other peptides show a signal-to-noise ratio between the two extremes shown in C and D.
    > A large amount of functional data was generated in the course of genetic screenings and functional genomic studies in yeast. Hence, for a number of the identified proteins, some cellular or functional data were already available in public data bases. In addition, for some of the less well characterized proteins, we analyzed the cellular localization of the GFP C-terminally tagged proteins and the respiratory competency of strains disrupted for the corresponding genes. These data are summarized in Table II and described below.
    > Functional Data on the New Proteins That Belong to Known Ribosomal Protein Families-Ribosomal protein families S7p and S10p are represented in yeast mitochondria by the corresponding homologues Yjr113c and Ydr041w. Mammalian homologues of S7 (19) and S10 (20) were also recently described as components of the bovine small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit.

    > Whole-genome sequencing has enabled investigations into the gene content of living many organisms and forms the foundation for further study of gene expression, proteomics and epigenetics. After assembly of a novel genome, gene annotation is often the first step in analysing the gene content of an organism. Accurate annotation of the exonic structure of genes is crucial to the success of all subsequent functional and comparative analyses.
    > Problems that can potentially be caused by incorrect gene annotation are numerous and can lead to incorrect assessments of the lifestyle and ecology of an organism. In comparative genomics where orthologous genes or conserved functional domains are compared between species/isolates, the estimated numbers of such genes/ domains can be distorted by less than perfect annotations (as described by Hane et al. [1], S Text 1). Prediction of extracellular secretion, which can be determined by a short signal peptide at the N-terminus, can miss secreted proteins if the start codon of a gene has been incorrectly annotated. Mis-annotating the start of protein translation could either cut off the signal peptide or bury it within the annotation. While a seemingly benign annotation error, the consequences for downstream research could be detrimental, particularly as the biotic interactions or industrial applications of microbes are largely determined by their secretomes. Additionally, translated protein sequences of novel species are often submitted to databases such as NCBI [2] and Uniprot [3]. It is commonplace to use these database entries to support the annotation of related species or isolates, meaning errors present in the pioneer annotation may be repeated. When these new annotations based on false assumptions are added to databases, there is not only a propagation of errors, but also a perceived strengthening of homology evidence for incorrect protein sequences.
    > In recent years, correction of in silico predicted gene annotations with RNA-seq derived transcripts and read alignments has enabled vastly improved genome annotations and corrections of annotated gene structures [4][5][6].
