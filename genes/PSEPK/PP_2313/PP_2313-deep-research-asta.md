## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q88KH7
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=DoxX family protein {ECO:0008006|Google:ProtNLM};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=PP_2313 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAN67926.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the DoxX family.
- **Key Domains:** DoxX. (IPR032808); DoxX-like_oxidoreductase. (IPR051907); DoxX (PF07681)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PP_2313" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas putida (strain ATCC 47054 / DSM 6125 / CFBP 8728 / NCIMB 11950 / KT2440).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PP_2313' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PP_2313** (gene ID: PP_2313, UniProt: Q88KH7) in PSEPK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

  - Snippet 1 (score: 0.760)
    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

    > Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to classify DEGs into functional categories [60]. The GO term database for M. extorquens AM1 ("272,630.protein.enrichment.terms.v12.0.txt") was obtained from the STRING database and filtered to include only terms associated with Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC), and Molecular Function (MF) [61]. The locus tags in this database were originally annotated using GenBank. These annotations were converted to RefSeq annotations, and genes lacking corresponding RefSeq annotations were excluded from the analysis.
    > Enrichment analysis was conducted separately for the upregulated and downregulated genes using the 'enricher' function from the 'clusterProfiler' package in R [62]. GO terms with a q-value < 0.1 were considered significantly enriched. The enrichment results were summarized by calculating the gene ratio, defined as the number of DEGs associated with a GO term divided by the total number of input genes, enabling the identification of specific functional categories influenced by gene expression changes while ensuring robustness against multiple hypothesis testing.
    > For differentially expressed genes (DEGs), annotation was standardized by referencing gene name (if available), locus tag, and annotated function. For DEGs lacking official gene names in both GenBank and RefSeq, putative names or functional descriptions were manually assigned based on homology, including 100% sequence identity using BLASTP searches against the NCBI nonredundant protein database [63] and structure-informed annotations using AlphaFold3 and Foldseek [47,48]. For instance, MEXAM1_RS04005, originally annotated only as a formyltransferase family protein, showed 100% identity with sequences MCP1543177.1, MCP1561485.1, and MCP1589478.1, and was thus designated as fmt.

Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.

Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

(e.g. 'No information about this protein was found by a literature search conducted on 23 February 2017' for ybiU). The full list of phrases that were used can be found in Dataset S5. When genes were annotated only with a protein domain or family, we still included them in the list because such domains (e.g. DUF1479 for ybiU) often themselves have no functional information associated (DUF1479 has the description 'Protein of unknown function' on Pfam: https: //pfam.xfam.org/family/PF07350).

    > In the past decade, many technology platforms have been developed that allow researchers to generate data on a genome scale. For example, profiling technologies have been developed for highly parallel measurements of gene expression, copy number, genotype, and epigenetic state. The data derived from these high-throughput approaches can then be used to generate new hypotheses or inferences of gene function. In contrast to experiments focusing on a specific gene or gene family, these genome-scale experiments typically result in the identification of a list of candidate genes that are relatively unfamiliar to any single researcher. Hit lists identified by these methods can often span many protein classes and signaling pathways. In many cases, these genes may also have little or no previous functional characterization.
    > Researchers are then faced with the daunting task of prioritizing these candidate genes for detailed functional and mechanistic studies. Dozens of gene annotation resources and model organism databases serve prominent roles in the genetics and genomics communities. Take, for example, the instance where a researcher has identified hundreds or even thousands of differentially expressed genes between a cancer sample and a matched control. In prioritizing this gene list, many researchers would commonly search Entrez Gene [1] and Ensembl [2] as a first stop for many descriptions of critical gene annotation information, including primary sequence data, genome position, associated Gene Ontology terms, gene structure, and genetic variation. Other researchers may then consult the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) [3] and Rat Genome Database (RGD) [4] for annotation focused on these model organisms, including knockout phenotypes and quantitative trait loci. Molecular and cellular biologists may then visit the STRING database for protein interaction data [5]. Other researchers may query reference Gene Atlas expression data using the SymAtlas web site [6]. In addition, there are a wide variety of gene annotation sites targeting more specific communities, including a database describing the targets of the transcription factor CREB [7], the Allen Brain Atlas showing high-resolution expression information by in situ hybridization in the mouse brain [8], and the TargetScan database for microRNA target prediction [9]. Hundreds of such online resources for mammalian gene annotation currently exist [10,11].

    > To obtain basic information on WERs and their target genes, such as official gene symbols, gene IDs, gene types, and genomic locations, gene annotations were downloaded from the GENCODE project [ 44 ] for human and mouse, and from NCBI [ 45 ] and Ensembl [ 46 ] for the other species. Genomic locations were extracted from the corresponding GTF annotation files. Gene symbols were primarily standardized based on the NCBI Gene database [ 45 ] for mRNAs and lncRNAs, GtR-NAdb [ 47 ] for tRNAs, miRbase [ 48 ] for microRNAs, and cir-cBase [ 49 ] for circRNAs. Deprecated or substituted versions of genes were filtered out. The LiftOver [ 50 ] program was employed to convert and unify genomic coordinates across different genome assembly versions.
    > The functional descriptions of WERs were compiled based on the UniProt database [ 51 ] and further supplemented with evidence from relevant publications, with particular emphasis on their functions as RNA modification regulatory proteins.

- Summary: A comprehensive protein localization analysis of essential genes in 27 prokaryotes including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and 1 archaeon has been performed and shows that proteins encoded by essential genes are enriched in internal location sites, while exist in cell envelope with a lower proportion compared with non-essential ones.

    > Bioinformatics Databases. DEG is a database of essential genes (http://www. essentialgene.org/). The newly released DEG 10 has been developed to accommodate the quantitative and qualitative advancements brought by the progressive identification methods. Currently available records of both essential and nonessential genes among a wide range of organisms can be downloaded from DEG 10, making it possible to compare the two different types of genes in many aspects 21 .
    > 27 prokaryotic organisms including 24 bacteria, 2 mycoplasmas and Methanococcus maripaludis S2, the only record of the Archaea domain were selected to analyze the protein localization and GO distribution of the essential and nonessential genes. There are 31 bacterial records corresponding to 27 organisms in the database in total and 26 sets of data were selected in the current study. Streptococcus pneumonia was not chosen for the lack of non-essential genes. Since the essential genes were not genome-widely identified, it's not reasonable to regard the complementary set of essential genes as non-essential genes in Streptococcus pneumonia 29,30 . In the case of multiple records for one organism, the one with the most convincing experimental methods was chosen. The non-essential genes in Methanococcus maripaludis S2 and 13 bacteria such as Escherichia coli MG1655 are obtained based on the original literatures, while non-essential genes in other 12 organisms such as Bacillus subtilis 168 are the complementary set of essential genes. The information of the organisms used in the current study are displayed in Table 1.
    > The three model genomes' subcellular location information and the Gene Ontology (GO) terms used for the analysis in the current study were downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt; http://www.uniprot.org). Maintained by the UniProt Consortium, UniProt is committed to providing biologists with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequences and functional annotation 27 . Among the wealth of annotation data, detailed GO annotation statements are included.

    > HymenopteraMine provides a report for each entity in the database. Each report is divided into sections including 'Summary', 'Gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Protein', 'Function', 'Homology', 'Others' or a subset of those categories, depending on the identifier searched. For example, searching a protein identifier would provide sections relevant to proteins. Each section of the report provides information in the form of a table that can be customized and downloaded in various formats. The Summary section of a Gene Report provides gene identifiers, symbols, description, organism, chromosome, strand and other identifiers such as aliases (identifiers from previous OGS versions) and database cross references. The Transcripts section provides information about the gene model (transcripts, exons, coding sequences) and gives a visual representation of the gene model highlighting the structure of the gene. Users can download FASTA-formatted sequences for each type of feature provided in the gene model section. Links are provided to JBrowse and to NCBI gene pages, when applicable. Transcript identifiers are linked to Transcript Reports, which include a Gene Expression section that provides raw read counts, normalized read counts, FPKM and RPKM values for RNAseq data with SRA metadata. The Protein section of the Gene Report includes protein name, accession and length. The protein name/accession numbers are linked to Protein Reports, with more information including protein family, GO annotations, InterPro domains, related publications, protein features, and curated notes from UniProt describing tissue specificity, function and developmental stages. The Function section provides GO annotation with evidence codes from the Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component ontologies. Clicking on the symbols to the right of each GO term leads to the directed acyclic graph showing all parents and children of the term, developed using the BioJS DAG Viewer (50). Clicking on a GO term provides a report for that term, a list of genes annotated with that term and tables showing relationships to other GO terms. The Homologue sec-tion lists homologues in other hymenopteran species and Drosophila melanogaster. The 'Other' section provides publications and a list of overlapping features.

    > Of the 19,984 protein-coding genes in C. elegans, 10,838 have a name/gene symbol (e.g. lin-12). Gene naming is largely investigator-initiated, with a request to WormBase through genenames@wormbase.org ; this will continue with C. elegans content in the Alliance. The gene symbol, which is formatted in lowercase and italics, communicates information about the gene based on mutant phenotype, functional criteria, orthology, or homology. To make genes easily recognizable to non-elegans researchers, the current preference is to name genes with human orthologs after the human gene if characterized. Gene name stability and formatting are important to avoid confusion in the literature and to facilitate searches of other databases that use the C. elegans gene symbols (e.g. UniProt) and text mining. However, occasionally names have been changed because of incorrect orthology or not supported by functional studies from the community. Names have also been changed based on requests from multiple community members (e.g. daf-21 renamed as hsp-90). To avoid name changes and to have the published name used in databases, researchers should contact WormBase prior to manuscript submission; the most common issue is that the requested name is already in use in C. elegans or another model organism for a nonhomologous gene product. Over the past 10 years, the community has averaged 180 new gene names per year, often with a corresponding publication, increasing knowledge about our favorite organism. More information about C. elegans-specific nomenclature can be found at https://wormbase.org/about/ userguide/nomenclature.

    > The protein set for the CHO midbody was derived from the accession numbers in Table S1 and Table S2 from Skop et al. [9]. Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.
    > The protein set for the HeLa spindle proteome is derived from the 1121 accession numbers in Sauer et al. supplementary table 1 column 2 [17]. Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.
