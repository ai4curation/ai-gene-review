  label: Pseudomonas putida KT2440
description: '2-oxoadipate dioxygenase/decarboxylase that catalyzes the decarboxylation and hydroxylation of 2-oxoadipate
  to form D-2-hydroxyglutarate. This Fe(2+)-dependent enzyme is specific for 2-oxoadipate and plays a crucial role in D-lysine
  catabolism in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. The enzyme performs the last step in a lysine degradation pathway, converting 2-oxoadipate
  (derived from lysine) into D-2-hydroxyglutarate with the release of CO2. Note: The deep research file incorrectly conflates
  this enzyme with Î±-hydroxyglutarate oxidoreductase from 1969 research, which catalyzes the opposite reaction (oxidizing
  D-2-hydroxyglutarate to 2-oxoglutarate).

  review:
    summary: 'This general oxidoreductase annotation is correct but too broad. The enzyme does perform oxidation-reduction,
      but a more specific term should be used.

    label: dioxygenase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'Correct annotation - the enzyme is indeed a dioxygenase that incorporates both atoms of O2, with one oxygen
      going into the hydroxyl group of 2-hydroxyglutarate and the other released as CO2 after decarboxylation.
