Below is a comprehensive research report on the Pseudomonas putida gene hglS (UniProt Q88CC1, locus tag PP_5260), which encodes a protein commonly annotated as “2‐oxoadipate dioxygenase/decarboxylase” and is a critical component of the D‐lysine catabolic pathway. This report brings together detailed information on gene function and molecular mechanisms, cellular localization, involvement in biological processes, protein domain organization and structural features, expression and regulatory patterns, evolutionary conservation, and key experimental evidence supporting these annotations. Throughout the text, specific data from recent studies are cited using the provided citation keys.

1. Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
HglS catalyzes the conversion of 2‐oxoadipate (2OA) to D‐2‑hydroxyglutarate (D‑2‑HG) by coupling decarboxylation with an oxygenation (hydroxylation) reaction, thereby providing a link between D‐lysine degradation and central metabolic processes such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 10-13). This reaction is unique in that it introduces a hydroxyl group into the substrate concomitant with the loss of a carboxylate group, resulting in the production of D‑2‑HG in a stereochemically defined manner that contrasts with pathways that form L‑2‑hydroxyglutarate (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 3-5, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 8-10). Mechanistic studies indicate that HglS is strictly specific for its substrate 2OA, and the enzyme displays catalytic rates (k_cat values around 330 min⁻¹) comparable to those observed in hydroxymandelate synthase, despite only limited sequence homology between these enzymes (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 10-13, thompson2019asongof pages 108-116). The biochemical reaction requires molecular oxygen and Fe(II) as a cofactor, and oxygen consumption assays demonstrate a 1:1 stoichiometry of O₂ utilization to 2OA turnover, with subsequent incorporation of oxygen atoms into the product as verified by isotopic labeling experiments (thompson2019asongof pages 108-116, thompson2019asongof pages 16-20). These observations, together with genetically determined growth defects in knockout strains on lysine as a sole carbon source, firmly establish HglS as a critical enzyme in the D‑lysine catabolic pathway (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, thompson2019asongofa pages 108-116).

2. Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
Although direct experimental data on the subcellular localization of HglS in Pseudomonas putida are limited, its role in central metabolism strongly suggests that it is localized within the cytoplasm where amino acid catabolism occurs (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 3-5). In contrast, homologous DUF1338 proteins in plant systems have been reported to partition to compartments such as the apoplast or other organelles involved in amino acid metabolism, although such differences in cellular localization likely reflect divergent trafficking in eukaryotic versus prokaryotic systems (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 8-10, thompson2019asongofa pages 29-34). Based on the genomic context and the metabolic function, it is most reasonable to infer that HglS operates in the cytosol of P. putida, where the coexistence of glycolytic and TCA cycle enzymes enables rapid metabolic flux in response to changing substrate availability (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 10-13, thompson2019asongofa pages 96-99).

3. Biological Processes and Pathway Involvement  
HglS is fundamentally involved in the lysine catabolic process as it catalyzes a key, previously missing, step that channels D‑lysine intermediates into central carbon metabolism (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 10-13). Specifically, by converting 2OA into D‑2‑HG, HglS enables the subsequent oxidation reaction (carried out by downstream enzymes such as those analogous to PP_4493) that ultimately generates 2‑ketoglutarate (2KG), a critical TCA cycle intermediate (thompson2019asongof pages 16-20, thompson2019asongofb pages 29-34). This connection between lysine degradation and central metabolism reinforces the biological importance of HglS in maintaining cellular energy balance and metabolic homeostasis (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 3-5, thompson2019asongof pages 108-116). Large-scale fitness profiling using random barcode transposon sequencing (RB-TnSeq) has demonstrated that disruption of hglS leads to marked growth defects when lysine is used as the sole carbon source, thereby validating its central role in amino acid metabolism (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, thompson2019asongofb pages 29-34).

4. Disease Associations and Phenotypic Implications  
Although HglS is derived from Pseudomonas putida and no direct disease association in humans has been reported—given that homologs of this enzyme are absent from animals and humans—the fundamental role of lysine catabolism in bacterial physiology suggests that impairments in this pathway can have significant phenotypic consequences. Genetic disruptions in hglS in P. putida result in growth defects when lysine is the sole energy source, and similar disruptions in homologous pathways in other bacteria have been linked to reduced fitness and metabolic inefficiencies (thompson2020aniron(ii) pages 36-49, thompson2019asongofa pages 20-26). In plants, mutation of DUF1338 homologs has been associated with developmental phenotypes such as delayed germination and impaired seed development, highlighting the metabolic significance of related enzymes in higher organisms (thompson2019asongof pages 99-102, thompson2019asongofa pages 96-99). While there are no direct disease phenotypes in Pseudomonas putida associated with hglS, the enzyme’s central function in lysine degradation might be of interest in applied contexts such as metabolic engineering and environmental bioremediation where altered amino acid metabolism can influence overall organismal performance (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, thompson2019asongofa pages 108-116).

5. Protein Domains and Structural Features  
HglS belongs to the DUF1338 family, which is a group of proteins of previously unknown function that are now recognized for their role in amino acid catabolism. The protein features a VOC (vicinal oxygen chelate) domain fold, which is typified by a central jelly roll or β‑barrel configuration (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 10-13, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitnessa pages 8-10). This structural motif forms the catalytic core of the enzyme and houses the active site where substrate binding and transformation occur. Critical to the enzyme’s activity is the coordination of an Fe(II) ion, mediated by a highly conserved HHE triad consisting of two histidine residues and one glutamate residue (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 8-10, thompson2019asongof pages 99-102). Structural studies, including high-resolution X‑ray crystallography, have revealed that in both the apo and substrate‑bound states the active site accommodates the metal cofactor in a geometry consistent with nonheme Fe(II) oxygenases, despite the fact that some crystal structures might show nickel due to purification protocols (thompson2019asongofa pages 96-99, thompson2019asongofa pages 102-106). In addition to the metal‑binding site, a crucial arginine residue (Arg74) has been identified as playing a fundamental role in substrate recognition by forming a salt bridge with the distal carboxylate of 2OA (thompson2019asongofa pages 108-116, thompson2019asongof pages 102-106). Furthermore, residues such as valine 402 and serine 403, which reside on a flexible loop that undergoes a pronounced conformational change upon substrate binding, establish hydrogen bonding interactions with the α‑keto group of the substrate and contribute to strict substrate specificity (thompson2019asongof pages 102-106, thompson2019asongof pages 108-116). Collectively, these structural features not only define the catalytic mechanism of HglS but also underscore the evolutionary conservation of the DUF1338/VOC domain across diverse organisms (thompson2019asongofa pages 29-34, thompson2019asongofa pages 7-9, thompson2019asongofa pages 99-102).

6. Expression Patterns and Regulation  
Gene expression analyses and targeted proteomics have revealed that hglS expression in Pseudomonas putida is regulated in response to the availability of lysine and its related metabolites. When cells are grown on lysine or related substrates such as 2‑aminoadipate (2AA) and glutarate, the expression levels of HglS and other lysine catabolic enzymes are notably upregulated (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, thompson2019asongof pages 16-20). This dynamic regulation implies that the cellular demand for HglS activity increases when lysine degradation is required, thereby ensuring efficient conversion of catabolic intermediates into metabolites that feed into central metabolic pathways (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 3-5, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 10-13). Moreover, fitness profiling experiments employing RB‑TnSeq have demonstrated that transposon insertions disrupting hglS result in significant fitness defects under conditions where lysine or its isomers are the primary carbon sources, further corroborating the regulated expression and functional indispensability of this gene (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 8-10, thompson2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 9-12). Although detailed promoter analysis or transcript stability studies are not provided in the current context, the collected proteomic and phenotypic data collectively indicate that HglS is part of a highly orchestrated regulatory network that modulates lysine metabolism in response to environmental and intracellular cues (thompson2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 9-12, thompson2020aniron(ii) pages 1-5).

7. Evolutionary Conservation  
Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses underscore the high degree of evolutionary conservation exhibited by the DUF1338 family proteins, including HglS. This family is widely distributed among bacteria, fungi, plants, and green algae, while being notably absent in animals and archaea, which suggests a fundamental role in microbial and plant physiology that is maintained across diverse taxonomic groups (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 8-10). The conservation of critical catalytic residues—especially those involved in Fe(II) coordination (the HHE triad) and substrate binding (notably Arg74)—is strikingly high; for example, nearly all DUF1338 homologs preserve these features, even in the face of low overall sequence identity (thompson2019asongofa pages 29-34, thompson2019asongofa pages 108-116, thompson2019asongof pages 26-29). In plants, homologs of HglS have been functionally characterized (e.g., FLO7 in rice and AT1G07040 in Arabidopsis thaliana), and these enzymes catalyze analogous reactions in lysine catabolism, affecting developmental processes such as seed germination and starch metabolism (thompson2019asongof pages 99-102, thompson2019asongofa pages 96-99). The presence of similar DUF1338 proteins in industrially and medically relevant bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pseudomonas fluorescens, further highlights the evolutionary importance of this enzyme for efficient amino acid degradation and metabolic adaptation (thompson2019asongofa pages 99-102, thompson2020aniron(ii) pages 5-10). Therefore, the evolutionary conservation of HglS supports its designation as a crucial enzyme within a deeply rooted metabolic pathway that has been maintained throughout billions of years of divergent evolution (thompson2019asongofa pages 108-116, thompson2019asongofa pages 99-102).

8. Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
The functional and mechanistic attributes of HglS have been elucidated using a variety of experimental approaches. High‑throughput fitness profiling via RB‑TnSeq was instrumental in pinpointing hglS as essential for lysine catabolism, with transposon insertions in this gene leading to significant growth deficiencies on D‑lysine and L‑lysine media (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 10-13). Purification of the recombinant protein followed by in vitro enzymatic assays demonstrated that HglS specifically converts 2OA to D‑2‑HG, as evidenced by LC‑TOF mass spectrometry and enzyme‑coupled decarboxylation assays that monitored CO₂ evolution and oxygen consumption (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 8-10, thompson2019asongof pages 108-116). Kinetic measurements further confirmed the high catalytic efficiency of HglS, with a reported V_max of approximately 0.33 mM/min and a substrate K_m of 0.06 mM, supporting the enzyme’s strong substrate affinity and rapid turnover (thompson2019asongof pages 108-116, thompson2019asongof pages 16-20). In addition, crystallographic studies have provided detailed insights into the enzyme’s three‑dimensional structure; high‑resolution X‑ray crystal structures (up to 1.1 Å resolution) have been solved for both the apo form and substrate‑bound states, revealing the DUF1338/VOC domain architecture, the Fe(II) binding pocket, and the conformational changes that occur upon substrate binding (thompson2019asongofa pages 96-99, thompson2019asongofa pages 102-106, thompson2019asongofa pages 108-116). Site‑directed mutagenesis of key residues such as Arg74 and Val402 has confirmed their critical roles in substrate binding and catalytic efficiency, as mutations at these positions dramatically reduce enzyme turnover (thompson2019asongof pages 102-106, thompson2019asongof pages 108-116). Collectively, these multiple lines of evidence—from genetic fitness assays and proteomic analyses to enzymatic kinetics and crystallography—establish HglS as an essential enzyme in P. putida lysine catabolism and provide robust support for its GO annotations related to oxidoreductase activity, decarboxylase activity, and iron ion binding (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 3-5, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 10-13).

9. Gene Ontology Annotation and Summary of Functional Attributes  
Based on the extensive experimental and comparative evidence, HglS can be robustly annotated with several high‑level Gene Ontology (GO) terms. In terms of molecular function, HglS is characterized as an “iron(II)-dependent oxygenase” and “decarboxylase” that exhibits specific oxidoreductase activity toward 2‑oxoadipate (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 10-13). The enzyme’s active site features, including the DUF1338 domain with its VOC fold, the conserved HHE triad, and critical substrate binding residues such as Arg74, directly support GO terms including “iron ion binding,” “oxidoreductase activity,” and “decarboxylase activity” (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 10-13, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitnessa pages 8-10, thompson2019asongof pages 102-106). Biologically, HglS is involved in the “lysine catabolic process” by mediating the oxidative decarboxylation of 2‑oxoadipate to D‑2‑hydroxyglutarate, thereby linking lysine degradation to central energy metabolism via the TCA cycle (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 8-10, thompson2019asongof pages 16-20, thompson2019asongofb pages 29-34). Although no direct human disease association exists for this bacterial gene, its essential role in lysine metabolism is evident from the severe growth phenotypes observed in gene disruption studies, and analogous alterations in plant homologs have been linked to developmental defects (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 3-5, thompson2019asongof pages 99-102). With respect to cellular components, the enzyme is predicted to be cytoplasmic in P. putida, consistent with its role in central metabolic pathways (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, thompson2019asongofa pages 96-99). Furthermore, the regulation of hglS expression in response to lysine and related metabolite availability supports its role as an inducible enzyme in amino acid catabolism, with targeted proteomics showing increased expression in lysine‑rich conditions (thompson2019asongof pages 16-20, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 3-5). Finally, the evolutionary conservation of HglS across diverse taxa, as evidenced by extensive phylogenomic analyses, highlights the ancient and critical nature of its metabolic function, which is maintained through conserved catalytic domains and key active site residues (thompson2019asongofa pages 29-34, thompson2019asongofa pages 108-116, thompson2019asongof pages 26-29).

10. Conclusion  
In summary, the Pseudomonas putida gene hglS (UniProt ID Q88CC1, locus tag PP_5260) encodes a DUF1338‑containing iron(II)-dependent decarboxylase/oxygenase that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of 2‑oxoadipate to produce D‑2‑hydroxyglutarate. This reaction represents the terminal enzymatic step of a D‑lysine catabolic pathway that connects amino acid degradation to central metabolic flux through the TCA cycle. Detailed structural analyses have revealed that HglS possesses a VOC domain fold featuring a highly conserved HHE triad and key substrate binding residues such as Arg74, Val402, and Ser403 that are essential for its substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency. Functional genetic and proteomic studies have demonstrated that hglS expression is inducible under conditions that promote lysine catabolism, and its disruption results in significant fitness defects when lysine is the sole carbon source. Although no direct disease associations have been documented for this bacterial gene, its evolutionary conservation across bacteria, plants, fungi, and green algae underscores its fundamental role in amino acid metabolism. The collective experimental evidence—including RB‑TnSeq fitness profiles, in vitro biochemical assays, kinetic measurements, and high‑resolution crystallographic structures—provides a solid basis for its GO annotations related to oxidoreductase activity, decarboxylase function, iron ion binding, and lysine catabolic process. Overall, HglS serves as a paradigmatic example of how previously uncharacterized protein families (DUF1338) can be functionally annotated through integrated genetic, biochemical, structural, and phylogenomic approaches, thereby contributing essential insights into metabolic network organization and regulation in Pseudomonas putida (blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 1-3, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 10-13, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 3-5, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitness pages 8-10, blakehedges2019massivelyparallelfitnessa pages 8-10, thompson2019asongof pages 102-106, thompson2019asongofa pages 96-99, thompson2019asongofa pages 29-34, thompson2019asongofa pages 108-116, thompson2019asongof pages 16-20).

This report offers robust, multi‐dimensional evidence supporting the current GO annotations for hglS and provides a foundation for further experimental and functional studies, particularly in the context of metabolic engineering and the elucidation of amino acid degradation pathways in diverse organisms.
