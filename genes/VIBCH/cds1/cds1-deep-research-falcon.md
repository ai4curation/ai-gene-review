## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9KT44
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=L-cysteine desulfhydrase Cds1 {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00868}; EC=4.4.1.1 {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00868};
- **Gene Information:** Name=cds1 {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00868}; OrderedLocusNames=VC_1061 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAF94220.1};
- **Organism (full):** Vibrio cholerae serotype O1 (strain ATCC 39315 / El Tor Inaba N16961).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the cysteine synthase/cystathionine beta-
- **Key Domains:** Cds1. (IPR047586); Cys_Synth/Cystath_Beta-Synth. (IPR050214); TrpB-like_PALP. (IPR001926); TrpB-like_PALP_sf. (IPR036052); PALP (PF00291)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "cds1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Vibrio cholerae serotype O1 (strain ATCC 39315 / El Tor Inaba N16961).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'cds1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **cds1** (gene ID: cds1, UniProt: Q9KT44) in VIBCH.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: cds1 (VC_1061) / UniProt Q9KT44 in Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor N16961

Gene/protein identity and symbol disambiguation
- Organism and locus: The target is Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor N16961, locus tag VC_1061. Primary literature on V. cholerae explicitly manipulates and complements VC1061 and refers to it functionally as cbs (cystathionine β‑synthase), with “CBS‑derived H2S” as the conceptual designation. For example: “Among the mutants of CBS candidates, only Δvc1061 showed a significant reduction in H2S production from cysteine,” and chromosomal complementation is described as “cbs (VC1061).” PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 4-6, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 13-15, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 2-4)
- Symbol ambiguity: The user’s UniProt record (Q9KT44) names the gene cds1 and annotates an L‑cysteine desulfhydrase–like PLP enzyme. In contrast, organism‑specific literature for VC1061 uses cbs and places the protein in the CBS/CSE/3MST cysteine‑degradation context. Given this discrepancy, the most reliable anchor is the locus tag (VC1061) in V. cholerae N16961; experimental evidence ties VC1061 to cysteine‑derived H2S and oxidative stress phenotypes under the gene name cbs in that work (see below). (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 2-4, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 4-6)

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Cysteine‑derived bacterial H2S: Bacteria produce H2S via several routes. Beyond classical sulfate reducers, many bacteria generate H2S by degrading L‑cysteine. A 2024 review summarizes three major contributors: (1) dissimilatory sulfate‑reducing bacteria; (2) sulfite reductase pathways in diverse bacteria; and (3) cysteine‑degrading enzymes (cysteine desulfhydrases and related PLP enzymes) that convert L‑cysteine to H2S, ammonia, and pyruvate. Biomolecules, Sept 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14091145 (shahid2024hydrogensulfidea pages 1-3, shahid2024hydrogensulfidea pages 3-4)
- In V. cholerae, cysteine degradation is the dominant H2S source: Genetic analysis showed that deletion of cbs (VC1061) drastically reduces H2S from L‑cysteine, while deletions targeting assimilatory sulfite reduction (cysI/cysJ) had little effect on H2S output under the tested conditions. PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 4-6)
- Mechanistic reaction (cysteine desulfhydrase‑type chemistry): The canonical cysteine desulfhydrase reaction yields H2S + pyruvate + NH3 from L‑cysteine; this is the concise definition employed in recent reviews for bacterial cysteine desulfhydrase activity, framing the chemistry relevant to VC1061’s phenotype in V. cholerae. Biomolecules, Sept 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14091145 (shahid2024hydrogensulfidea pages 1-3, shahid2024hydrogensulfidea pages 3-4)

Primary function, substrates, products, and cofactor
- Experimental role of VC1061 in V. cholerae: Ma et al. designate VC1061 as a CBS candidate and demonstrate that Δvc1061 uniquely reduces H2S production from cysteine among CBS‑candidate mutants; they further refer to “CBS‑derived H2S” throughout. Their approach does not provide purified‑enzyme kinetics, but the cellular phenotypes (H2S readouts, stress resistance, complementation) establish that the VC1061 gene product is the principal contributor to cysteine‑derived H2S in their system. PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 2-4, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 4-6)
- Reaction context: While literature names VC1061 “CBS,” the dominant functional outcome is H2S generation from L‑cysteine in vivo. This outcome is consistent with PLP‑dependent β‑elimination chemistry typical of cysteine desulfhydrases (H2S + pyruvate + NH3). (Definition from 2024 review). Biomolecules, Sept 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14091145 (shahid2024hydrogensulfidea pages 1-3, shahid2024hydrogensulfidea pages 3-4)

Biological processes, pathway context, and localization
- Oxidative stress resistance via catalase activation and iron handling: Endogenous H2S driven by cbs/VC1061 protects V. cholerae from H2O2. Δcbs shows ~10‑fold lower viability under intense H2O2; complementation rescues survival. H2S scavenging with heterologous SQR partly abolishes protection, demonstrating H2S as the effector. CBS‑derived H2S enhances catalase activity (especially KatB) predominantly at a post‑translational level, associated with higher iron content in catalase and increased iron storage (Dps). PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 4-6, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 6-7, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 7-10, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 10-11)
- Host colonization: In adult mouse models, a cbs mutant is outcompeted by WT under high‑ROS conditions; complementation restores fitness, indicating CBS‑dependent H2S facilitates host colonization through oxidative stress mitigation. PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 10-11)
- Broader Vibrionaceae cysteine‑to‑H2S metabolism: Environmental metagenomic/metatranscriptomic work in 2024 bioRxiv reactors links Vibrionaceae (including Vibrio MAGs) with cyuA‑encoded cysteine desulfidase/desulfhydrase pathways and shows that cysteine enrichment rapidly induces H2S, ammonium, acetate and upregulates cyuA versus sulfate conditions—supporting the prevalence and rapidity of cysteine‑derived H2S in Vibrionaceae guilds. bioRxiv, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.12.589155 (nguyentiet2024identificationofbacteria pages 7-10, nguyentiet2024identificationofbacteria pages 13-16, nguyentiet2024identificationofbacteria pages 16-19)

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 emphasis)
- 2024 review: Consolidates microbial H2S biogenesis routes and frames cysteine desulfhydrases as key bacterial sources, with the canonical reaction definition (cysteine → H2S + pyruvate + NH3). This provides current consensus terminology aligning with the user’s UniProt annotation (desulfhydrase activity) and the V. cholerae phenotype reported in 2021. Biomolecules, Sept 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14091145 (shahid2024hydrogensulfidea pages 1-3, shahid2024hydrogensulfidea pages 3-4)
- 2024 environmental study: Demonstrates that in mixed communities seeded from aquaculture systems, cysteine enrichment selects for Vibrionaceae and strongly upregulates cyuA; H2S appears faster from cysteine than from sulfate (51–82 mg H2S/L by day 5 versus 14–28 days to reach similar levels under sulfate; short incubations: ≈10 ± 7.9 mg H2S/L/d from cysteine with no measurable H2S from sulfate). bioRxiv, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.12.589155 (nguyentiet2024identificationofbacteria pages 7-10, nguyentiet2024identificationofbacteria pages 13-16)

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Pathogenesis and stress tolerance: In V. cholerae, targeting the cbs/VC1061‑dependent H2S axis diminishes oxidative stress resilience and host colonization capacity, suggesting potential for antivirulence strategies that disrupt cysteine‑derived H2S production or scavenge H2S. The proof‑of‑concept use of heterologous SQR to attenuate H2S‑mediated protection supports this concept. PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 6-7, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 7-10)
- Environmental engineering: Mixed‑culture reactor results indicate that non‑sulfate cysteine degradation can rapidly generate H2S in engineered systems; recognizing Vibrionaceae contributions (cyuA‑linked) informs mitigation strategies (e.g., limiting cysteine availability or targeting cysteine‑degrading pathways) in aquaculture and wastewater settings. bioRxiv, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.12.589155 (nguyentiet2024identificationofbacteria pages 7-10, nguyentiet2024identificationofbacteria pages 13-16, nguyentiet2024identificationofbacteria pages 19-23)

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Authoritative bacterial pathogenesis perspective: Ma et al. argue that “CBS is the key enzyme for H2S production in V. cholerae,” and that endogenous H2S at micromolar levels, rather than exogenous donors at millimolar levels, confers cytoprotection by enhancing catalase activity and promoting iron storage. This mechanistic link elevates cysteine‑derived H2S as a bona fide virulence‑enabling factor in V. cholerae. PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 4-6, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 7-10, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 10-11)
- Contemporary consensus framing: The 2024 review situates cysteine desulfhydrase chemistry as a core bacterial H2S route, aligning with the phenotype observed for VC1061 in V. cholerae and supporting inference that the PLP enzyme category annotated as “cysteine desulfhydrase” captures the net chemistry observed in vivo, even when literature labels a given ortholog as CBS. Biomolecules, Sept 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14091145 (shahid2024hydrogensulfidea pages 1-3, shahid2024hydrogensulfidea pages 3-4)

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Genetic evidence in V. cholerae: Only Δvc1061 among CBS candidates reduces H2S from cysteine (Pb(Ac)2 strips; fluorescence reporter). Deletion of cysI/cysJ (assimilatory sulfite reduction) has little effect relative to cbs deletion, indicating cysteine degradation dominates H2S production. PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 4-6)
- Oxidative stress phenotypes: Deletion of cbs reduces survival ~10‑fold under 1 mM H2O2; cbs complementation or exogenous H2S donors restore protection (with exogenous H2S requiring mM levels, versus endogenous μM levels). H2S scavenging by heterologous SQR reduces viability by ~80% relative to the no‑SQR control in Δcbs backgrounds engineered for cbs expression. PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 6-7)
- Catalase and iron metrics: CBS‑derived H2S increases total catalase activity, with preferential impact on KatB under H2O2 stress; cbs expression elevates iron content in purified KatB and increases cellular iron storage (Dps‑dependent). PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 7-10, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 10-11)
- In vivo colonization: In adult mice with high ROS (streptomycin only), Δcbs is outcompeted by WT; complementation (Δcbs lacZ::Plac‑cbs) matches WT. Under low ROS (streptomycin + N‑acetylcysteine), the fitness defect of Δcbs is no longer observed. PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 10-11)
- Mixed‑culture kinetics: In aquaculture‑seeded reactors, cysteine enrichment reached 51–82 mg H2S/L by day 5; sulfate reactors required 14–28 days to reach similar levels. In short incubations, cysteine yielded ≈9.99 ± 7.86 mg H2S/L/d, whereas sulfate yielded no measurable H2S in the same timeframe. Vibrionaceae increased in cysteine‑enriched reactors, with cyuA expression significantly upregulated in cysteine‑ versus sulfate‑fed conditions. bioRxiv, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.12.589155 (nguyentiet2024identificationofbacteria pages 7-10, nguyentiet2024identificationofbacteria pages 13-16)

Conclusions specific to VC1061 (V. cholerae N16961)
- VC1061 is the principal determinant of cysteine‑derived endogenous H2S in V. cholerae under laboratory conditions, functioning within the CBS/CSE/3MST cysteine‑degradation framework and conferring resistance to oxidative stress through catalase activation and iron storage, thereby enhancing host colonization. The literature uses the gene name cbs for VC1061, not cds1; nonetheless, the observed cellular chemistry aligns with L‑cysteine desulfhydrase‑type output (H2S, pyruvate, NH3) described for bacterial cysteine‑degrading PLP enzymes. PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763. Biomolecules, Sept 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14091145 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 2-4, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 4-6, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 7-10, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 10-11, shahid2024hydrogensulfidea pages 1-3)

Limitations and open questions
- Direct biochemical characterization of the VC1061 enzyme (purified protein, kinetics, substrate spectrum) was not presented in the 2021 study; functional assignment is based on genetic and physiological evidence. Further work could resolve whether VC1061 exhibits classical CBS activity, desulfhydrase activity, or both, and define its catalytic efficiency across substrates. PLOS Pathogens, July 20, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009763 (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 2-4, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 4-6)

Verification summary (per critical instructions)
- Gene symbol match: In V. cholerae literature, VC1061 is annotated as cbs (CBS), not cds1; UniProt notation cds1 appears to conflict with organism‑specific literature usage. Proceed with VC1061 locus as the authoritative anchor. (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 13-15, ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 2-4)
- Organism: Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor N16961 verified by locus usage and strain notation in Ma et al., 2021. (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 13-15)
- Family/domains: Functional framing places VC1061 among PLP‑dependent cysteine‑degradation enzymes (CBS/CSE/3MST orthologs), consistent with a PLP fold; cellular output is cysteine‑derived H2S. (ma2021cbsderivedh2sfacilitates pages 4-6)
- Ambiguity handling: Where literature for other taxa uses cds1 for different proteins, this report avoids cross‑organism extrapolation and relies on V. cholerae VC1061 evidence and recent bacterial H2S reviews. (shahid2024hydrogensulfidea pages 1-3)
