description: >-
  L-cysteine desulfhydrase (Cds1) is the principal enzyme for cysteine-derived hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
  production in V. cholerae. It catalyzes the PLP-dependent conversion of L-cysteine to hydrogen sulfide,
  pyruvate, and ammonia (EC 4.4.1.1). The enzyme-derived H2S protects V. cholerae from oxidative stress
  by enhancing catalase activity and promoting iron storage, thereby facilitating host colonization.
  Note that in organism-specific literature, this gene is referred to as cbs (cystathionine beta-synthase),
  though the demonstrated functional activity is L-cysteine desulfhydrase.

    label: L-cysteine biosynthetic process
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation represents a cysteine biosynthetic function, but experimental evidence from
      Ma et al. (2021) demonstrates that VC1061/cds1 functions primarily in cysteine catabolism
      to produce H2S, not biosynthesis. The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from
      orthologs that may include cysteine synthases, but the V. cholerae enzyme has been experimentally
      characterized as a cysteine desulfhydrase that degrades cysteine.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The annotation is incorrect for this specific gene. Ma et al. (2021) clearly demonstrate that
      VC1061 is the principal enzyme for H2S production FROM cysteine degradation, not cysteine
      biosynthesis. Deletion of VC1061 drastically reduces H2S production from cysteine, indicating
      a catabolic rather than biosynthetic role. The phylogenetic inference from IBA incorrectly
      propagated function from related cysteine synthases (SF194/SF162) that catalyze the reverse
      reaction. MSA analysis of PTHR10314 family reveals: (1) SF135 (Cds1/desulfhydrases) has a
      distinct active site signature motif (ASSGST) vs synthases (PTSGNTG); (2) SF135 shares only
      ~24% sequence identity with synthases, less than synthases share with each other (43%);
      (3) SF135 has the longest branch length (0.528) from the family root, indicating greatest
      divergence and neo-functionalization; (4) different EC class - 4.4.1.1 (lyase/catabolism)
      vs 2.5.1.47 (transferase/biosynthesis). The source proteins in the IBA WITH/FROM field
      (P0ABK5/CysK, P35520/CBS, P16703/CysM) are from SF194/SF162 synthase subfamilies, but
      Q9KT44/VC1061 is in SF135 which evolved a catabolic function.

      Cytoplasmic localization is consistent with the function of this PLP-dependent enzyme.
      UniProt annotation (HAMAP-Rule:MF_00868) also indicates cytoplasmic localization,
      supported by both homology inference and computational prediction.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Cytoplasmic localization is well-supported by both phylogenetic inference (IBA) and
      computational methods. PLP-dependent enzymes of this class are typically cytoplasmic,
      and there is no evidence for any alternative localization. This represents a core
      aspect of the protein's function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on EC:2.5.1.47 mapping, which assigns cysteine synthase activity
      (O-acetyl-L-serine + H2S -> L-cysteine + acetate). However, the primary experimentally
      demonstrated activity for VC1061 is the opposite reaction - L-cysteine desulfhydrase
      activity (EC 4.4.1.1), which degrades cysteine to produce H2S.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The EC mapping to cysteine synthase (EC 2.5.1.47) is incorrect for this enzyme. Ma et al. (2021)
      demonstrated that VC1061 is the principal H2S-producing enzyme from cysteine degradation in
      V. cholerae. UniProt correctly annotates this enzyme with EC 4.4.1.1 (L-cysteine desulfhydrase)
      via HAMAP-Rule:MF_00868. The correct molecular function term is GO:0080146 (L-cysteine

  review:
    summary: >-
      Lyase activity is a high-level term that correctly captures the general enzymatic class
      of L-cysteine desulfhydrases. The enzyme catalyzes a carbon-sulfur lyase reaction
      (C-S bond cleavage), which is classified under lyases (EC 4.x.x.x).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While this is a broad term, it is not incorrect. L-cysteine desulfhydrase (EC 4.4.1.1)
      is indeed a lyase that cleaves C-S bonds. This annotation provides useful high-level
      classification, though more specific terms (GO:0080146) should also be present.
      Keeping this annotation maintains appropriate ontology hierarchy representation.

      PLP binding is essential for Cds1 catalytic activity. The enzyme belongs to the

      activity, making this annotation essential for understanding the enzyme's mechanism.

      This is the correct molecular function term for Cds1 based on experimental evidence.
      Ma et al. (2021) demonstrated that VC1061 is the principal enzyme for H2S production

      This annotation should be added as the primary molecular function for Cds1. The existing

      This biological process annotation should be added to reflect the primary physiological

    summary: >-
      The H2S produced by Cds1 protects V. cholerae from oxidative stress by enhancing
      catalase (KatB) activity. Deletion mutants show approximately 10-fold lower viability
      under H2O2 stress compared to wild-type.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      Experimental evidence from Ma et al. (2021) demonstrates that Cds1-derived H2S is
      essential for oxidative stress resistance. The phenotype (reduced survival under H2O2)
      of cbs/VC1061 deletion mutants supports IMP evidence for involvement in this process.
      However, this may be considered a downstream effect rather than a core function of
      the enzyme, so could alternatively be marked as KEEP_AS_NON_CORE.
