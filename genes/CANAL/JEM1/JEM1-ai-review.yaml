description: >-
  ER-lumenal J-domain containing co-chaperone (DnaJ/Hsp40 family) in Candida
  albicans. CaJem1p is the ortholog of S. cerevisiae Jem1p and localizes to the
  endoplasmic reticulum. Functions together with BiP/Kar2p (ER Hsp70) in protein
  folding and quality control in the ER lumen. When expressed in S. cerevisiae,
  CaJem1p suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth and ER quality control
  defects of the jem1-delta scj1-delta mutant, confirming functional conservation
  (PMID:18754794). CaJem1p can also suppress the karyogamy defect of the
  jem1-delta mutant when overexpressed, though less efficiently than ScJem1p due
  to differences in the N-terminal domain that mediates interaction with Nep98p
  (PMID:18754794). Contains a DnaJ/J-domain (Pfam PF00226) and a TPR-like
  domain. Has a signal peptide for ER targeting.

      IBA annotation for binding to chaperone proteins. JEM1 is a J-domain
      co-chaperone that binds to and stimulates the ATPase activity of the ER
      Hsp70 BiP/Kar2p.

      JEM1/Jem1p functions as a co-chaperone partner for the ER Hsp70
      BiP/Kar2p. PMID:18754794 states that Jem1p "functions together with
      another J protein, Scj1p, in protein folding and quality control in the
      ER as a partner for the ER Hsp70 (BiP/Kar2p)." Binding to a
      protein-folding chaperone (BiP) is a core function.

      ER localization is well established for JEM1 family members. PMID:18754794

      IBA annotation for protein folding in the ER. JEM1 functions with BiP

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Protein folding in the ER is a core function of JEM1. PMID:18754794
      demonstrates that "expression of CaJem1p from a single-copy plasmid
      suppressed the temperature sensitive growth and the ER quality control
      defect of the jem1-delta scj1-delta mutant." This directly confirms
      CaJem1p functions in ER protein folding and quality control.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for misfolded protein binding. JEM1 is involved in ER
      protein quality control, which involves recognition of misfolded proteins.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      JEM1/Jem1p is involved in ER protein quality control alongside Scj1p
      and BiP/Kar2p. Quality control involves recognition and binding of
      misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. The IBA annotation is consistent with
      this role and is at an appropriate level of specificity for a J-domain
      co-chaperone involved in quality control.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IGI annotation for karyogamy (nuclear fusion during mating). Based on
      genetic interaction with S. cerevisiae jem1 mutant. CaJem1p can suppress
      the karyogamy defect when overexpressed.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Karyogamy function is established for ScJem1p, and CaJem1p can partially
      complement this when overexpressed. However, this is not a core molecular
      function of the protein -- it is a downstream biological process mediated
      by its co-chaperone activity. Furthermore, PMID:18754794 shows the
      karyogamy function is less efficient for CaJem1p than ScJem1p due to
      weaker interaction with Nep98p. Mark as non-core.

    summary: >-
      IGI annotation for unfolded protein binding. GO:0051082 is proposed for
      obsoletion. JEM1 is a J-domain co-chaperone that assists BiP in protein
      folding in the ER.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is being obsoleted. JEM1 functions as a co-chaperone for
      BiP/Kar2p in the ER, assisting in protein folding and quality control.
      The appropriate replacement is GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone"
      which captures the chaperone activity of JEM1 in assisting protein
      folding via the Hsp70 system. JEM1 does not merely bind unfolded
      proteins passively; it actively participates in the folding cycle by
      stimulating BiP ATPase activity through its J-domain.
