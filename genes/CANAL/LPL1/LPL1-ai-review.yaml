    label: lipid metabolic process
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'This broad biological process term is appropriate for a phospholipase B enzyme. The S. cerevisiae homolog LPL1 is well-characterized as functioning in lipid metabolism, specifically in phospholipid hydrolysis and lipid droplet dynamics. The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from characterized orthologs.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'The annotation is supported by strong homology to S. cerevisiae LPL1, which has demonstrated roles in lipid metabolism. Phospholipase B enzymes by definition participate in lipid metabolic processes through hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids. The term accurately captures the core metabolic function without being overly specific.'

    label: phosphatidylcholine lysophospholipase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'This molecular function represents one of the three activities of phospholipase B enzymes - the lysophospholipase activity. However, this annotation is too narrow as it only captures one aspect of phospholipase B function and is specific to phosphatidylcholine substrates, while the enzyme likely has broader substrate specificity.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'Phospholipase B enzymes have three distinct activities: sn-1/sn-2 fatty acid ester hydrolase, lysophospholipase, and transacylase activity. The current term only captures the lysophospholipase activity on phosphatidylcholine. The more comprehensive term GO:0102545 (phospholipase B activity) would better represent the full enzymatic capability of this protein, as it encompasses all three activities and broader substrate specificity.'

    label: lipid droplet
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'This cellular component annotation is strongly supported by characterization of the S. cerevisiae homolog LPL1, which shows exclusive localization to lipid droplets during stationary phase. This localization is consistent with the enzyme role in lipid metabolism and storage regulation.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'The S. cerevisiae LPL1 has been experimentally demonstrated to localize exclusively to lipid droplets at stationary phase. This localization makes functional sense for a phospholipase B enzyme involved in lipid metabolism and droplet dynamics. The IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from the well-characterized S. cerevisiae ortholog is reliable.'

    label: monoacylglycerol lipase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'This annotation suggests additional lipase activity beyond phospholipase function. While some lipases can have promiscuous substrate specificity, there is no direct evidence that LPL1 homologs have monoacylglycerol lipase activity as a primary function. This appears to be a secondary or promiscuous activity.'
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: 'The primary characterized function of LPL1 homologs is phospholipase B activity on glycerophospholipids, not monoacylglycerol hydrolysis. While the enzyme may have some activity on monoacylglycerols due to the general lipase domain, this is likely not the core function. The annotation may reflect substrate promiscuity rather than the primary enzymatic role. Keeping as non-core acknowledges potential activity without overstating its importance.'

    label: membrane
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'This generic membrane annotation is based on automated prediction from a transmembrane domain (residues 286-306 per UniProt). However, this is inconsistent with the well-characterized lipid droplet localization of the S. cerevisiae homolog. The predicted transmembrane domain may represent a hydrophobic region for lipid droplet association rather than true membrane insertion.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'The annotation conflicts with experimental evidence showing exclusive lipid droplet localization for the S. cerevisiae homolog. While the protein has a predicted hydrophobic region (286-306), this likely mediates lipid droplet association rather than membrane integration. Lipid droplets have a unique phospholipid monolayer structure distinct from bilayer membranes. The generic "membrane" term is misleading and the more specific "lipid droplet" annotation (GO:0005811) is already present and correct.'

    label: lipid catabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'This biological process annotation accurately describes the catabolic aspect of phospholipase B activity - the hydrolysis of phospholipids into fatty acids and lysophospholipids. This is a appropriate child term of the broader lipid metabolic process already annotated.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'Phospholipase B enzymes catalyze the hydrolytic breakdown of glycerophospholipids, which is definitionally a lipid catabolic process. The annotation correctly captures this catabolic function. While based on automated keyword mapping (IEA), it aligns with the known enzymatic activity of phospholipase B family members.'

    label: hydrolase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'This is an overly broad molecular function term that provides minimal information about the specific enzymatic activity. While technically correct (phospholipases are hydrolases), this annotation adds no value beyond what is already captured by more specific terms.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'The term "hydrolase activity" is too generic and uninformative. The protein already has more specific molecular function annotations (phospholipase/lysophospholipase activities) that are children of hydrolase activity in the GO hierarchy. This broad parent term adds no additional information and represents the type of vague annotation that should be avoided according to curation guidelines. The specific phospholipase B activity (GO:0102545) provides much more informative functional annotation.'
