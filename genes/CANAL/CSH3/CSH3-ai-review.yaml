  label: Candida albicans (strain SC5314 / ATCC MYA-2876)
description: >-
  ER membrane packaging chaperone in Candida albicans. CSH3 is a functional and
  structural homolog of S. cerevisiae Shr3p, an ER-resident membrane protein
  with 4 transmembrane helices and the SHR3_chaperone Pfam domain (PF08229).
  CSH3/Shr3p is specifically required for proper folding and ER exit of amino
  acid permeases. A csh3-delta/csh3-delta null mutant has reduced amino acid
  uptake capacity and is unable to switch morphologies in response to inducing
  amino acids (PMID:14756779). CSH3 haploinsufficiency impairs amino acid uptake
  and virulence in a mouse model. CSH3 is not a small heat shock protein or
  general unfolded protein binder; it is a specialized ER membrane chaperone for
  amino acid transporter biogenesis.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for ER membrane localization. CSH3 is an integral ER
      membrane protein with 4 transmembrane helices, consistent with its
      S. cerevisiae Shr3p ortholog.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      ER membrane localization is a core feature of CSH3. The protein has 4
      predicted transmembrane helices (UniProt) and the SHR3_chaperone domain.
      PMID:14756779 demonstrates ER localization by IDA. The IBA annotation
      is well supported.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for ER-to-Golgi transport. CSH3/Shr3p assists amino acid
      permeases in proper folding so they can be packaged into COPII vesicles
      for ER-to-Golgi transport.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      ER-to-Golgi transport is a direct consequence of CSH3's core function
      as a packaging chaperone. Shr3p is specifically required for proper
      folding of amino acid permeases so they can exit the ER via COPII
      vesicles. This is well established for the Shr3 family and CSH3 is
      a functional ortholog (PMID:14756779).

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for unfolded protein binding. GO:0051082 is proposed for
      obsoletion. CSH3 is not a general unfolded protein binder; it is a
      specialized ER membrane chaperone for amino acid permeases.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is being obsoleted. CSH3/Shr3p is an ER membrane packaging
      chaperone that specifically assists in the folding of amino acid permeases
      in the ER membrane. It does not broadly bind unfolded proteins. The
      appropriate replacement is GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" which
      captures the chaperone function of assisting protein folding. Note that
      GO:0140309 "unfolded protein carrier activity" would not be appropriate
      because CSH3/Shr3p does not carry/escort proteins between compartments;
      rather, it assists in folding within the ER membrane.

      IMP annotation for filamentous growth. csh3-delta mutants are unable

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Filamentous growth defect is a downstream phenotypic consequence of
      impaired amino acid sensing/uptake due to loss of CSH3 function. The
      paper shows the csh3-delta/csh3-delta null mutant "is unable to switch
      morphologies on solid and in liquid media in response to inducing amino
      acids" (PMID:14756779). This is not a direct molecular function of CSH3
      but a consequence of its role in amino acid permease biogenesis.

      Heat response is likely a downstream phenotypic consequence of
