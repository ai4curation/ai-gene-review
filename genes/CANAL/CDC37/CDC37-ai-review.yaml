  label: Candida albicans (strain SC5314 / ATCC MYA-2876)
description: >-
  Hsp90 co-chaperone Cdc37 in Candida albicans. Functions as a kinase-specific
  co-chaperone that binds to numerous kinases and promotes their interaction with
  the Hsp90 complex, resulting in stabilization and promotion of their activity.
  Interacts with the Crk1 kinase domain and is required for Crk1 protein
  production (PMID:15013782). Belongs to the CDC37 family. Unlike classical
  holdase chaperones, CDC37 does not broadly bind unfolded proteins; rather, it
  specifically recognizes protein kinase domains and recruits them to the Hsp90
  system.

      IBA annotation for cytoplasmic localization, supported by phylogenetic
      inference from multiple orthologs. UniProt indicates cytoplasmic
      localization by similarity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Cytoplasmic localization is consistent with the known biology of CDC37
      family members, which function in the cytoplasm to deliver kinase clients
      to Hsp90. UniProt annotation states "Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}".

      IBA annotation for involvement in protein folding process. CDC37 assists
      in kinase maturation via the Hsp90 chaperone system.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      CDC37 participates in protein folding as a co-chaperone that delivers
      kinase clients to Hsp90 for proper folding and maturation. This is a
      well-established core function of the CDC37 family.

      Cdc37" and forms a complex with Hsp90.

      IBA annotation for unfolded protein binding. GO:0051082 is proposed for

      CDC37 is a kinase-specific Hsp90 co-chaperone, not a general unfolded

      CDC37 binds the Hsp90 chaperone directly. This is a core function
      of the protein. The GO:0031072 annotation is more specific and
      informative, but this annotation is also correct.
