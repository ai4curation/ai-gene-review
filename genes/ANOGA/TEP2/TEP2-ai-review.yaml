description: >-
  TEP2 (Thioester-containing protein 2) is a secreted complement-like protein
  belonging to the alpha-2-macroglobulin/thioester-containing protein family in
  the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. TEP2 contains a conserved
  thioester motif (GCGEQ) that enables covalent attachment to pathogen surfaces,
  functioning as a predicted opsonin similar to the well-characterized TEP1.
  The protein is encoded by gene AGAP008366 located in a TEP gene cluster on
  chromosome arm 3R (29A-30E), near TEP15. While TEP1 has been extensively
  studied for its role in anti-Plasmodium immunity, TEP2 remains less
  characterized but is predicted to function similarly based on conserved domain
  architecture. TEP2 expression is induced ~9-fold in mosGILT-null mosquitoes,
  indicating responsiveness to immune pathway perturbation. The protein is
  expected to be secreted into the hemolymph where it circulates until deployment
  on pathogen surfaces.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation is derived from the UniProt keyword "Immunity" (KW-0391)
      through automated mapping. TEP2 is a thioester-containing protein belonging
      to the TEP family which functions in insect innate immunity. The protein
      contains an intact thioester motif and is part of the complement-like
      immune pathway in A. gambiae (Christophides et al., 2002). Expression is
      significantly induced (~9-fold) in mosGILT-null mosquitoes, demonstrating
      responsiveness to immune pathway perturbation (Arora et al., 2024).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      TEP2 is a member of the thioester-containing protein family which plays
      essential roles in insect innate immunity. The annotation to "immune system
      process" is technically correct and appropriate for this complement-like
      protein, although it is a broad term. The induction of TEP2 in immune-perturbed
      mosquitoes and its TEP family membership strongly support this annotation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is derived from InterPro domain mapping (IPR001599 Alpha-2-
      macroglobulin and IPR002890 MG2 domain) which are shared with protease
      inhibitors like alpha-2-macroglobulin. However, TEP2 is a thioester-containing
      protein that belongs to the complement-like branch of this family, not the
      protease inhibitor branch. Similar to the well-characterized TEP1 in A. gambiae,
      TEP2 is predicted to function as an opsonin that covalently tags pathogen
      surfaces via its reactive thioester bond, not as a protease inhibitor
      (Shokal and Eleftherianos, 2017). There is no experimental evidence that
      TEP2 acts as an endopeptidase inhibitor.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      TEP2 is a thioester-containing protein that functions as a predicted
      complement-like opsonin in the insect innate immune pathway, not as a
      protease inhibitor. While it shares alpha-2-macroglobulin domains with
      protease inhibitors, the TEP family has diverged to function primarily in
      pathogen opsonization rather than protease inhibition. This is well
      established for TEP1 in A. gambiae and applies by homology to TEP2. The
      annotation represents an over-annotation based solely on domain homology
      without consideration of the functional divergence of the TEP family.
      This is the same issue identified for TEP1 annotation review.

      TEP2 is predicted to be a secreted protein based on its TEP family
      membership and signal peptide features. The well-characterized TEP1 is
      secreted into the hemolymph, and TEP2 is expected to follow the same
      localization pattern (Baxter et al., 2010).

      The annotation is consistent with TEP family biology. TEP proteins are
      secreted into the hemolymph (extracellular region in insects) where they
      circulate until activated and deposited on pathogen surfaces. The UniProt
      entry confirms secreted localization based on ARBA annotation. While
      direct experimental evidence for TEP2 localization is lacking, the
