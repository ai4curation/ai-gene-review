## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q7PMG3
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Gustatory and odorant receptor 22;
- **Gene Information:** Name=GPRgr22 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:ABK97612.1}; ORFNames=AGAP009999;
- **Organism (full):** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the insect chemoreceptor superfamily. Gustatory
- **Key Domains:** 7TM_chemorcpt. (IPR013604); 7tm_7 (PF08395)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GPRgr22" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GPRgr22' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GPRgr22** (gene ID: GPRgr22, UniProt: Q7PMG3) in ANOGA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional annotation of Anopheles gambiae/coluzzii Gr22 (AGAP009999; UniProt Q7PMG3)

Executive summary
Gr22 encodes a seven‑transmembrane gustatory/odorant receptor that belongs to the insect chemoreceptor superfamily and forms, together with Gr23 and Gr24, the heteromeric CO2 receptor in the maxillary palp capitate‑peg sensilla of Anopheles gambiae/coluzzii. Gene‑editing and heterologous expression studies indicate Gr23 and Gr24 are obligate for CO2 sensitivity, whereas Gr22 modulates sensitivity. Electrophysiology and oocyte assays show activation by CO2 per se (not bicarbonate). Recent (2023–2024) work has expanded neurogenetic toolkits that provide genetic access to Gr22‑expressing neurons for imaging and circuit mapping, while prior studies identified modulatory odorants that can mask or alter CO2 detection, suggesting routes for vector‑control applications. Male palps express Gr22–Gr24 at lower levels than females. Key concepts and detailed evidence are summarized below, with URLs and dates where available.

1) Identity, family, and domains
- Gr22 is a gustatory receptor (GR) with seven transmembrane helices, part of the insect chemoreceptor superfamily, consistent with UniProt Q7PMG3 and AGAP009999 annotations. Cross‑species analyses place GR22 with the conserved mosquito CO2 receptor clade (GR22/23/24 orthologs) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-39099-0, Feb 2019) (coutinhoabreu2019odorantligandsfor pages 1-2). Supporting functional genetic evidence places Gr22 in the cpA neuron of the capitate‑peg sensilla (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.103470, Dec 2020) (liu2020geneeditingreveals pages 1-3).

2) Receptor complex composition and Gr22’s role
- In vivo gene editing in Anopheles coluzzii demonstrates that Gr23 and Gr24 are absolutely required for CO2 detection; Gr22 knockouts retain residual responses but with markedly reduced sensitivity, supporting a modulatory role that enhances Gr23/Gr24 complex function (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.103470, Dec 2020) (liu2020geneeditingreveals pages 1-3).
- Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes shows binary GR2/GR3 (AgamGR23/24) combinations are sufficient for robust activation, while inclusion of GR1/Gr22 modulates sensitivity (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103284, Feb 2020) (xu2020co2perse pages 1-6).

3) Cellular localization and neural projections
- Gr22, with Gr23 and Gr24, is expressed in the CO2‑sensitive cpA neuron of capitate‑peg sensilla on the maxillary palps; single‑sensillum mapping and genetic approaches support this localization (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-39099-0, Feb 2019; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.103470, Dec 2020) (coutinhoabreu2019odorantligandsfor pages 4-6, liu2020geneeditingreveals pages 1-3).
- Neuroanatomy indicates that maxillary palp ORNs, including the GR22–24 CO2 neuron, project to defined antennal‑lobe (AL) glomeruli implicated in CO2 processing, mapped using the Q‑system to label ORN classes and reconstruct their projections (https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms13010, Oct 2016) (riabinina2016organizationofolfactory pages 1-2).

4) Ligand/activation and signaling mechanism
- Using pH manipulations of bicarbonate solutions and direct measurements of dissolved CO2 in Xenopus oocyte recordings, mosquito CO2 receptors are activated by CO2 per se, not by bicarbonate. GR2/GR3 (AgamGR23/24) are essential for activation; GR1/Gr22 modulates sensitivity (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103284, Feb 2020) (xu2020co2perse pages 1-6).

5) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- A 2024 Cell Reports Methods study introduced an expanded neurogenetic toolkit for An. gambiae, integrating T2A‑QF2 drivers at chemoreceptor loci (including Gr22) via CRISPR‑HDR and Cre/lox excision to generate driver lines compatible with QUAS‑reporters and transcuticular calcium imaging (GCaMP6f). This provides genetic access to Gr22‑expressing neurons for functional imaging and mapping (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2024.100714, Feb 2024) (giraldo2024anexpandedneurogenetic pages 1-3).
- A 2023 bioRxiv preprint described a complementary toolkit and highlighted the GR22/23/24 complex as CO2 sensitive and responsive to other VOCs; it demonstrated feasibility of genetic access and imaging approaches for these neurons (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.16.553590, Aug 2023) (giraldo2023aneurogenetictoolkit pages 1-5).

6) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Chemical modulation of the CO2 pathway: single‑sensillum recordings in Anopheles identified activators, inhibitors, and ultra‑prolonged activators of the cpA neuron. Compounds such as ethyl pyruvate and (E)‑2‑methylbut‑2‑enal inhibit or mask CO2‑elicited spiking; related activators/inhibitors have been used to alter attraction in greenhouse/semi‑field tests, supporting trap enhancement or masking strategies (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-39099-0, Feb 2019) (coutinhoabreu2019odorantligandsfor pages 4-6).
- Genetic disruption/modulation: CRISPR‑Cas9 knockout of Gr23/Gr24 abolishes CO2 sensitivity in vivo, while Gr22 deletion diminishes sensitivity, validating these genes as targets for behavioral interference studies and as genetic entry points for circuit dissection (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.103470, Dec 2020) (liu2020geneeditingreveals pages 1-3).

7) Expert opinions/analysis and authoritative sources
- Convergent evidence across in vivo gene editing (An. coluzzii), heterologous expression (Xenopus), and electrophysiology (single‑sensillum) defines a model in which GR23/GR24 form the obligate CO2‑gated receptor and GR22 modulates sensitivity. The conclusion that CO2 per se is the activating species resolves prior debates and informs chemical ecology strategies for modulation (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103284, Feb 2020; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.103470, Dec 2020) (xu2020co2perse pages 1-6, liu2020geneeditingreveals pages 1-3).
- Neurogenetic toolkits (2023–2024) are rapidly enabling precise anatomical and functional access to Gr22‑expressing neurons, positioning the field for high‑resolution circuit and behavior studies (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2024.100714, Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.16.553590, Aug 2023) (giraldo2024anexpandedneurogenetic pages 1-3, giraldo2023aneurogenetictoolkit pages 1-5).

8) Relevant statistics and data
- In vivo: Gr23/Gr24 knockout eliminates CO2 responsiveness in cpA; Gr22 knockout significantly reduces spike responses to CO2 relative to wild type, demonstrating a modulatory role (single‑sensillum electrophysiology; CRISPR‑engineered lines) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.103470, Dec 2020) (liu2020geneeditingreveals pages 1-3).
- Heterologous: Binary AgamGR23/24 in oocytes yields stronger current responses than ternary AgamGR22/23/24; increased dissolved CO2 correlates directly with increased receptor current, supporting CO2 as the ligand (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103284, Feb 2020) (xu2020co2perse pages 1-6).
- Expression (sex bias): RNA‑seq in male maxillary palps shows Gr22–Gr24 are detectable but substantially lower than female palps, indicating female‑biased expression; in males, Gr22 is higher than Gr23/Gr24 among the three (https://doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjaa290, Feb 2021) (athrey2021theexpressionof pages 1-1, athrey2021theexpressionof pages 3-4).

9) Verification of identity and domain/family alignment; ambiguity check
- The gene symbol “Gr22” (also referenced as AgamGR22) here corresponds to the Anopheles gambiae/coluzzii gustatory receptor subunit of the CO2 receptor complex and matches UniProt Q7PMG3 (AGAP009999), annotated as a gustatory/odorant receptor with 7TM topology. Multiple Anopheles‑focused sources corroborate this identity, organism, and family assignment, and no conflicting gene symbol usage was found in other organisms for the specific combination “AGAP009999/Gr22” within the CO2 receptor context (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-39099-0; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.103470) (coutinhoabreu2019odorantligandsfor pages 1-2, liu2020geneeditingreveals pages 1-3).

Applications and outlook
- The cpA CO2 pathway is a validated target for behaviorally based vector control. Chemical masks or prolonged activators can dampen or desensitize cpA signaling, potentially reducing host seeking or enhancing trap specificity. CRISPR‑enabled access to Gr22‑expressing neurons and circuits will accelerate discovery of effective modulators and allow testing of combinatorial odor blends that interact with CO2‑guided navigation (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-39099-0; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2024.100714) (coutinhoabreu2019odorantligandsfor pages 4-6, giraldo2024anexpandedneurogenetic pages 1-3).
