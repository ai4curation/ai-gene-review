description: >-
  Gustatory receptor 22 (Gr22/AGAP009999) is a seven-transmembrane gustatory/odorant receptor
  belonging to the insect chemoreceptor superfamily. It functions as a modulatory subunit of
  the heteromeric CO2 receptor complex (Gr22/Gr23/Gr24) in the maxillary palp capitate-peg
  sensilla of Anopheles gambiae. CRISPR gene-editing studies demonstrate that Gr23 and Gr24
  are obligate (essential) for CO2 sensitivity, while Gr22 enhances sensitivity but is not
  required for basic CO2 detection. The receptor complex is expressed in the cpA neuron of
  capitate-peg sensilla on maxillary palps and responds to dissolved CO2 per se (not
  bicarbonate). This CO2 detection pathway is critical for host-seeking behavior in
  blood-feeding mosquitoes.

    summary: >-
      Gr22 is phylogenetically conserved as part of the CO2 receptor clade in insects. While
      "olfactory receptor activity" captures the broad chemosensory function, a more specific
      term exists: GO:0170015 "carbon dioxide receptor activity". The IBA annotation is
      phylogenetically sound but should be modified to use the more specific CO2 receptor term.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The term "olfactory receptor activity" is accurate but too general. Gr22 specifically
      functions as part of the CO2 receptor complex. GO:0170015 "carbon dioxide receptor
      activity" precisely describes the molecular function. The phylogenetic inference is
      valid - this receptor family is conserved for CO2 detection across insects (Liu et al.

  review:
    summary: >-
      The IBA annotation for axon localization is inferred from Drosophila orthologs
      (FBgn0032416, FBgn0035870). However, specific localization data for Gr22 within
      the cpA neuron anatomy in Anopheles is limited. The neuron projects to antennal lobe
      glomeruli, but whether Gr22 protein specifically localizes to axonal compartments
      versus dendrites versus cell body requires direct experimental validation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While the cpA neurons expressing Gr22 do project axons to the antennal lobe (Riabinina
      et al. 2016), the specific subcellular localization of the Gr22 protein itself in
      Anopheles has not been directly demonstrated. This is a reasonable phylogenetic
      inference but represents neuronal architecture rather than the core molecular function
      of the receptor.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for dendrite localization based on Drosophila orthologs. Chemosensory
      receptors in insect sensilla are typically localized to the dendritic compartment
      where they contact the sensillum lymph. This is the expected functional localization
      for a receptor detecting volatile CO2.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The dendrite localization is consistent with the function of gustatory/odorant
      receptors in insect sensilla. The cpA neuron in capitate-peg sensilla has dendritic
      projections that contact the sensillum environment where CO2 would be detected. This
      represents the functional compartment for chemosensory reception and is supported by
      the phylogenetic inference from characterized Drosophila orthologs.

  review:
    summary: >-
      The IBA annotation indicates Gr22 is active in the neuronal cell body, inferred from
      orthologs including FBgn0041250 and WB:WBGene00001803. While the receptor is expressed
      in neurons, the primary functional localization for chemoreception would be in
      dendritic compartments rather than the cell body.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      The neuronal cell body localization reflects expression data rather than the site of
      primary receptor function. The receptor is synthesized in the cell body and transported
      to dendrites where it functions in CO2 detection. This annotation is not incorrect but
      is peripheral to the core molecular function.

      IEA annotation from UniProtKB subcellular location vocabulary mapping. As a
      seven-transmembrane receptor, plasma membrane localization is expected and consistent
      with its function as a cell-surface chemoreceptor.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      UniProt annotation indicates "Cell membrane; Multi-pass membrane protein" based on
      sequence evidence. The seven transmembrane domain topology (7TM_chemorcpt, IPR013604)
      supports membrane localization. This is consistent with the receptor function in
      detecting extracellular CO2.

      IEA annotation based on UniProtKB keyword mapping (KW-0807 Transducer). This is a
      very general term that applies to most receptors. More specific biological process
      terms are available that describe the actual function.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      "Signal transduction" is overly broad. The receptor's specific role is in detection
      of CO2 as part of olfactory chemosensation. More specific terms like GO:0010037
      "response to carbon dioxide" or GO:0003031 "detection of carbon dioxide" better
      capture the biological process. This annotation is not wrong but adds little

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Although derived from keyword mapping, this term accurately reflects the biological
      process. CO2 detection via the Gr22/Gr23/Gr24 complex in maxillary palps represents
      olfactory chemosensation. The cpA neurons project to antennal lobe glomeruli,
      consistent with olfactory processing (Jones et al. 2007, Riabinina et al. 2016).

    reason: >-
      This is a valid inference from the 7TM chemoreceptor domain. While "plasma membrane"
      (GO:0005886) is more specific, having both annotations is acceptable as the IEA

      Despite belonging to the gustatory receptor family, Gr22 functions in olfactory
      CO2 chemosensation, not taste. The receptor is expressed in maxillary palp sensilla
      that detect volatile CO2 for host-seeking behavior, not in taste sensilla on the
      proboscis. Literature consistently describes this as an olfactory pathway (Jones et

      This annotation is incorrect for Gr22. While the gustatory receptor family name
      suggests taste function, Gr22 specifically functions in olfactory CO2 detection

  title: Deep research summary for GPRgr22
  findings:
    - statement: Gr22 is a modulatory subunit of the CO2 receptor complex
      supporting_text: "In vivo gene editing in Anopheles coluzzii demonstrates that Gr23 and Gr24 are absolutely required for CO2 detection; Gr22 knockouts retain residual responses but with markedly reduced sensitivity, supporting a modulatory role"

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      Gr22 functions as a modulatory subunit of the heteromeric CO2 receptor complex
      (Gr22/Gr23/Gr24) in the cpA neuron of capitate-peg sensilla on maxillary palps.
      It enhances CO2 sensitivity but is not obligate for CO2 detection (Gr23/Gr24 are
      obligate). The complex responds to dissolved CO2 per se and mediates olfactory
      detection of CO2 for host-seeking behavior.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What is the precise contribution of Gr22 to CO2 sensitivity in the Gr22/Gr23/Gr24
      complex? Does it affect sensitivity threshold, response kinetics, or both?
    experts:
      - Laurence J. Zwiebel
      - Anandasankar Ray
  - question: >-
      Does Gr22 respond to any volatile odorants beyond CO2, or is it strictly specific
      for CO2 modulation?
    experts:
      - Walter S. Leal

suggested_experiments:
  - hypothesis: >-
      Gr22 knockout mosquitoes will show reduced CO2 sensitivity but retain basic
      CO2 detection ability
    description: >-
      Generate CRISPR knockout of Gr22 in Anopheles gambiae and measure
      electrophysiological responses to varying CO2 concentrations in cpA neurons
      using single-sensillum recordings. Compare dose-response curves between
      wild-type and Gr22-/- mosquitoes.
    experiment_type: electrophysiology

  - hypothesis: >-
      Gr22 protein localizes to dendritic compartments of cpA neurons
    description: >-
      Use CRISPR-mediated T2A-GFP knock-in at the Gr22 locus to visualize
      subcellular localization of Gr22-expressing neurons. Combine with
      immunohistochemistry using dendritic and axonal markers.
    experiment_type: immunohistochemistry
