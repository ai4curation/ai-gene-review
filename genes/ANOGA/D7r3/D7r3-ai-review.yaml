description: >-
  D7r3 is a short-form salivary protein from female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes that facilitates
  blood feeding by binding and sequestering host biogenic amines (serotonin, histamine, norepinephrine,
  and adrenaline). Like D7r1 and other short-form D7 proteins, it functions as a "kratagonist" -
  capturing host signaling molecules with high affinity to prevent their vasoconstrictive, platelet-aggregating,
  and inflammatory effects. The protein is secreted into saliva during blood feeding. D7r3 belongs
  to the PBP/GOBP (Pheromone/Odorant-Binding Protein) structural family but has evolved a distinct
  function unrelated to olfaction.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on structural family membership (PBP/GOBP family via InterPro
      IPR006170) but does not reflect the actual function of D7r3. The protein binds biogenic
      amines (serotonin, histamine, norepinephrine, adrenaline), not odorants, and has no role
      in olfaction.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      D7r3 belongs to the PBP/GOBP structural family (InterPro IPR006170), which led to this
      IEA annotation. However, the D7 proteins have evolutionarily repurposed this fold for
      binding biogenic amines in saliva, not odorants in antennae. D7r3 is expressed exclusively
      in female salivary glands [PMID:11841502, PMID:9990055], not olfactory tissues. UniProt
      explicitly states "Binds serotonin, noradrenaline, histamine and adrenaline" [UniProt:A0A1S4GYH9,
      PMID:16301315]. The actual molecular functions are serotonin binding (GO:0051378) and
      histamine binding (GO:0051381). This is a clear case where structural homology does not
      predict function. The GO:0005549 definition "Binding to an odorant, any substance capable
      of stimulating the sense of smell" does not apply - serotonin and histamine are not odorants.
      Deep research on D7 family confirms "short-form D7s (including D7r1) predominantly bind
      biogenic amines (serotonin/5-HT, histamine, epinephrine/norepinephrine)"
      [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation correctly reflects the subcellular localization of D7r3 as a secreted
      salivary protein. However, there is a more specific IDA annotation for extracellular
      space (GO:0005615) from PMID:17913537.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      D7r3 is a secreted protein with a signal peptide (residues 1-21) [UniProt:A0A1S4GYH9].
      It is released into the extracellular space (saliva) during blood feeding. The UniProt
      entry confirms "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted" [UniProt:A0A1S4GYH9]. This is an
      appropriate CC annotation, though the more specific GO:0005615 (extracellular space)
      with IDA evidence from PMID:17913537 is also present.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation captures one downstream effect of D7r3's biogenic amine scavenging
      activity. By sequestering serotonin and norepinephrine (vasoconstrictors), D7r3
      indirectly promotes vasodilation at the feeding site.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      UniProt states "Exhibits vasodilating activity" [UniProt:A0A1S4GYH9, PMID:16301315].
      However, this is an indirect effect - D7r3 does not directly cause vasodilation but
      rather prevents vasoconstriction by scavenging host vasoconstrictive amines. The primary
      molecular function is binding biogenic amines (kratagonism), with vasodilation being a
      downstream consequence. This is acceptable as a non-core BP annotation describing the
      physiological outcome in the host. The deep research notes "Scavenging of host amines
      would antagonize their vasoconstrictor, platelet-aggregating, and pain-inducing properties"
      [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

    label: blood vessel diameter maintenance
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is overly general. D7r3 affects blood vessel diameter indirectly by
      scavenging vasoconstrictive amines, but "blood vessel diameter maintenance" implies
      homeostatic regulation, which is not the protein's function.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      GO:0097746 (blood vessel diameter maintenance) is defined as "Any process that modulates
      the extent or rate of blood vessel diameter change". While D7r3 does affect vascular tone
      by preventing vasoconstriction (through amine scavenging), calling this "maintenance" is
      misleading. The protein disrupts normal host vascular responses rather than maintaining
      them. The annotation derives from the UniProt "Vasoactive" keyword (KW-0838), but D7r3's
      role is specifically anti-hemostatic modulation of host physiology, not vascular homeostasis.
      The more accurate annotation would be vasodilation (GO:0042311) or negative regulation of
      vasoconstriction.

      The IDA evidence from PMID:17913537 is based on proteomic identification of D7r3 in
      female Anopheles gambiae saliva. The publication states they performed "proteomic and
      immunoproteomic analysis of anopheles and Aedes saliva" and identified salivary antigens.
      UniProt cites this paper for "IDENTIFICATION BY MASS SPECTROMETRY, SUBCELLULAR LOCATION,
      AND TISSUE SPECIFICITY" [UniProt:A0A1S4GYH9]. This provides direct experimental evidence
      that D7r3 is present in the extracellular space (saliva). This is a core CC annotation.

      UniProt confirms "Binds serotonin, noradrenaline, histamine and adrenaline (PubMed:16301315)"

      kratagonism - sequestering host serotonin to prevent vasoconstriction. GO:0051378 definition
      "Binding to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), a monoamine neurotransmitter" accurately
      describes this function. PMID:16301315 explicitly tested D7 short proteins and showed
