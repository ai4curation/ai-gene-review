### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PGRPLC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PGRPLC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PGRPLC** (gene ID: PGRPLC, UniProt: A7UTA1) in ANOGA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Gene/protein identity verification
PGRPLC is the Anopheles gambiae ortholog of Drosophila PGRP-LC and corresponds to AGAP005203; it encodes a transmembrane peptidoglycan-recognition receptor with a PGRP/amidase_2-fold domain. Alternative splicing yields three principal isoforms (PGRPLC1/2/3). This mapping and isoform architecture are documented for An. gambiae/coluzzii midgut and link directly to IMD/REL2 signaling (Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2020; DOI:10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 1-3, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 3-6, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 10-12). Foundational functional work in An. gambiae established PGRP-LC as the IMD-pathway receptor controlling antibacterial defense, gut bacterial homeostasis, and Plasmodium infection intensity (PLoS Pathogens, 2009; DOI:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000542) (meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 1-2, meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 2-4, meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 9-9).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and domain architecture: PGRPLC (AGAP005203; UniProt A7UTA1) encodes a membrane receptor bearing an extracellular PGRP domain of the amidase_2 superfamily that recognizes peptidoglycan (PGN). Despite the amidase fold, PGRP-LC functions as a non-catalytic pattern-recognition receptor in mosquitoes (structural alignment/modeling; no amidase activity reported) (PLoS Pathogens, 2009; DOI:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000542) (meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 11-12, meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 10-11).
- Isoforms and receptor assembly: Three main isoforms (LC1/LC2/LC3) arise by alternative splicing and differ in their PGRP ectodomains. LC3 contains a two-residue insertion predicted to prevent it from initiating dimerization; modeling supports a role for LC3 in sequestering monomeric PGN under low-dose conditions and stabilizing signaling heterodimers under high-dose conditions (PLoS Pathogens, 2009; DOI:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000542) (meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 9-9, meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 11-12).
- Ligand specificity: PGRPLC discriminates between polymeric DAP-type PGN and monomeric muropeptides (TCT). In pull-down assays, LC1 and LC3 bind insoluble polymeric DAP-PGN, while LC2 forms complexes with LC3 in the presence of TCT monomer, indicating isoform-dependent sensing of distinct PGN forms (Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2020; DOI:10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 10-12, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 6-8).
- Signaling pathway: PGRPLC is the principal transmembrane receptor that activates the mosquito IMD/REL2 NF-κB pathway, leading to induction of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes and bacterial control. Anopheles lacks PGRP-LE; thus, PGRP-LC-driven sensing in the gut is particularly important (IBMB 2020; PLoS Pathog 2009) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 1-3, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 3-6, meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 1-2).
- Cellular/tissue localization: Functional analyses localize PGRPLC activity to the midgut epithelium with regionalized expression—PGRPLC1 enriched in cardia/anterior midgut; PGRPLC2/3 more uniform; REL2-responsive AMPs (GAM1, CEC1, LYSC1) show distinct regional patterns (IBMB 2020; DOI above) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 10-12, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Contemporary expert reviews emphasize PGRP-LC as the canonical IMD receptor in mosquitoes, integrating microbiota control with gut compartmentalization of AMPs and tolerance mechanisms (Philosophical Transactions B, 2024; DOI:10.1098/rstb.2023.0063) (hixson2024innateimmunityin pages 9-10). Parasites & Vectors (2024) reviews position cecropins, gambicins, and lysozymes under IMD/Toll control and outline their roles against bacteria and Plasmodium (DOI:10.1186/s13071-024-06161-4) (li2024responseofthe pages 10-11). A 2024 IMD/AMP review also reaffirms PGRP-LC/LE sensing of DAP-PGN to drive NF-κB–dependent AMPs (IJMS, 2024; DOI:10.3390/ijms25073835) (zhou2024insectantimicrobialpeptides pages 9-10).
- New mechanistic links to peritrophic matrix (PM): Recent work shows bacterial cell wall components (e.g., DAP-PGN, Lys-PGN, LPS) can stimulate PM formation through IMD activation; knockdown of PGRP-LC or REL2 reduces Per1 transcription and PM integrity in mosquitoes, implicating PGRP-LC–IMD in PM homeostasis and, by extension, parasite invasion barriers (PLOS Biology, 2025; DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.3002967) (song2025cellwallcomponents pages 18-19).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Vector competence modulation: RNAi silencing of PGRPLC increases Plasmodium infection intensities and prevalence (P. berghei and P. falciparum), demonstrating that modulating PGRP-LC–IMD signaling can alter malaria transmission potential. This positions PGRP-LC pathway components as candidate targets in genetic or microbial interventions to reduce vector competence by rebalancing gut microbiota and strengthening epithelial defenses (PLoS Pathog, 2009; DOI:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000542) (meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 4-5).
- Gut microbiota homeostasis/PM engineering: Given PGRP-LC’s role in controlling post-bloodmeal bacterial expansion and in promoting PM formation via IMD, manipulating PGRP-LC signaling could reinforce the PM barrier or microbiota composition to impair Plasmodium development (PLOS Biology, 2025; DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.3002967) (song2025cellwallcomponents pages 18-19) and is consistent with 2024 reviews on gut immune zonation (Philosophical Transactions B, 2024; DOI:10.1098/rstb.2023.0063) (hixson2024innateimmunityin pages 9-10).

4) Expert opinions and analysis
- Consensus across 2024 reviews underscores PGRP-LC as the central IMD receptor in mosquitoes, with compartmentalized expression and downstream AMP programs shaping symbiont control and pathogen resistance (Philosophical Transactions B, 2024; Parasites & Vectors, 2024; IJMS, 2024) (hixson2024innateimmunityin pages 9-10, li2024responseofthe pages 10-11, zhou2024insectantimicrobialpeptides pages 9-10). These analyses align with functional and biochemical isoform specificity established in Anopheles (IBMB 2020) and foundational An. gambiae genetics (PLoS Pathog 2009) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 10-12, meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Systemic antibacterial challenge survival (RNAi PGRPLC): Whole-gene KD decreased survival—E. coli, 50% mortality by day 4; S. aureus, 50% by day 2 and near-complete by day 6 (both P<0.001). Isoform KD: LC3 KD led to 50% mortality by day 2 (E. coli) and day 1 (S. aureus); LC1/LC2 KDs gave 40–50% mortality by day 6 (P≤0.05) (PLoS Pathog, 2009; DOI:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000542) (meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 4-5, meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 2-4).
- AMP induction after infection: At 3 h, CEC1 increased 4–5-fold and DEF1 2–3-fold; induction required PGRPLC for S. aureus but not for E. coli (PLoS Pathog, 2009) (meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 4-5).
- Midgut microbiota expansion: After a bloodmeal, gut bacteria expand by up to several thousand-fold, coincident with robust PGRPLC-mediated AMP induction (PLoS Pathog, 2009) (meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 9-9).
- Plasmodium infection outcomes: Whole PGRPLC KD increased P. berghei median oocysts 4.4-fold (P<0.001) and elevated P. falciparum prevalence from 41% to 52% with higher median intensity (P<0.005) (PLoS Pathog, 2009) (meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 4-5).
- Gut regionalization and isoform-specific AMP control (midgut): REL2 KD reduced GAM1 across regions (p<0.05) and LYSC1 in cardia (p=0.05) and anterior (p<0.05). PGRPLC1 KD increased GAM1 in anterior (p<0.05). PGRPLC2 KD reduced GAM1 in cardia/anterior (p<0.05), reduced LYSC1 in posterior (p<0.05), and reduced CEC1 in cardia (p<0.05). PGRPLC3 KD reduced LYSC1 in cardia (p<0.05) and posterior (p<0.01) (IBMB, 2020; DOI:10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 10-12, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 6-8).
- Biochemical ligand interactions: Co-precipitation shows LC1 and LC3 bind insoluble polymeric DAP-type PGN; LC2 forms complexes with LC3 in the presence of the monomeric muropeptide TCT (IBMB, 2020) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 10-12, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 6-8).

Functional annotation synthesis for PGRPLC (AGAP005203; UniProt A7UTA1)
- Primary function: Transmembrane pattern-recognition receptor of the IMD/REL2 pathway. Recognizes DAP-type PGN ligands in both polymeric (bacterial sacculus) and monomeric (TCT-like) forms via isoform assemblies. It is not an active amidase enzyme; rather, it uses a PGRP/amidase_2 structural fold for ligand binding and receptor dimerization to initiate signaling (PLoS Pathog, 2009; IBMB, 2020) (meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 11-12, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 10-12).
- Substrate specificity: Discriminates DAP-type PGN. LC1/LC3 bind polymeric DAP-PGN; LC2 associates with LC3 in the presence of TCT, suggesting LC2 contributes to monomeric muropeptide sensing (IBMB, 2020) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 10-12, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 6-8).
- Cellular localization and site of action: Epithelial plasma membrane of the midgut, with region-specific expression patterns and downstream regulation of REL2-responsive AMPs; systemic roles also evidenced by survival phenotypes after hemolymph bacterial challenge (IBMB, 2020; PLoS Pathog, 2009) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 10-12, meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 2-4).
- Pathway placement: Upstream PRR of the mosquito IMD pathway, activating REL2/NF-κB to induce AMPs (e.g., CECs, GAM1, LYSC1) and shape gut bacterial homeostasis and peritrophic matrix regulation, indirectly constraining Plasmodium development (Philosophical Transactions B, 2024; Parasites & Vectors, 2024; PLoS Pathog, 2009; PLOS Biology, 2025) (hixson2024innateimmunityin pages 9-10, li2024responseofthe pages 10-11, meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 4-5, song2025cellwallcomponents pages 18-19).

Notes on symbol ambiguity check
No conflicting gene symbol usage for PGRPLC in Anopheles gambiae was found in the collected literature; the locus consistently maps to AGAP005203 and encodes the PGRP-LC IMD receptor with the described isoforms (IBMB, 2020; PLoS Pathog, 2009) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 1-3, meister2009anophelesgambiaepgrplcmediated pages 2-4).
