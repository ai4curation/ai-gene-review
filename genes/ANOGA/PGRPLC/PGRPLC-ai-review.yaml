description: >
  PGRPLC (AGAP005203) is a transmembrane peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) that serves as the
  principal upstream receptor for the IMD (Immune Deficiency) signaling pathway in Anopheles gambiae.
  It is the ortholog of Drosophila PGRP-LC. Despite containing an amidase_2 superfamily domain,
  PGRPLC functions as a NON-CATALYTIC pattern recognition receptor that binds DAP-type peptidoglycan
  from bacterial cell walls to initiate innate immune signaling. Three main isoforms (LC1, LC2, LC3)
  arise from alternative splicing and show distinct ligand binding properties: LC1 and LC3 bind
  polymeric DAP-PGN, while LC2 forms complexes with LC3 in the presence of monomeric TCT muropeptides.
  PGRPLC-mediated activation of the REL2/NF-kB pathway induces antimicrobial peptide expression,
  controls gut microbiota homeostasis, and indirectly modulates Plasmodium infection intensity in
  this malaria vector species.

  review:
    summary: >
      The IBA annotation for extracellular space is propagated from Drosophila PGRP-LC orthologs
      and human PGRPs. However, Anopheles PGRPLC is a transmembrane receptor with a single
      transmembrane helix (residues 218-241 per UniProt) and the PGRP domain is located
      C-terminal to this transmembrane region, indicating the receptor domain faces extracellularly.
      The protein is membrane-anchored, not secreted into the extracellular space.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >
      PGRPLC is a type I transmembrane protein based on UniProt domain annotation showing
      a transmembrane helix at positions 218-241 and the PGRP domain at 280-425. The deep
      research (file:ANOGA/PGRPLC/PGRPLC-deep-research-falcon.md) confirms it is localized to the
      "Epithelial plasma membrane of the midgut". The annotation should reflect plasma membrane
      localization, not extracellular space which implies a secreted/soluble form.

      PGRPLC is firmly established as an immune receptor that initiates the innate immune
      response against bacterial pathogens in Anopheles gambiae. RNAi knockdown experiments

      peptide induction (file:ANOGA/PGRPLC/PGRPLC-deep-research-falcon.md).

      This is a well-supported core function. The deep research establishes that PGRPLC
      knockdown "decreased survival - E. coli, 50% mortality by day 4; S. aureus, 50% by
      day 2 and near-complete by day 6" and impairs AMP induction. The term 'immune response'

      This is an OVER-ANNOTATION. While PGRPLC contains an amidase_2 superfamily domain
      (IPR002502), the literature explicitly states that PGRP-LC functions as a non-catalytic
      pattern recognition receptor in insects. The amidase fold is used for peptidoglycan
      binding and receptor dimerization, NOT for enzymatic hydrolysis.

      receptor in mosquitoes (structural alignment/modeling; no amidase activity reported)".
      The IBA annotation is propagated from PANTHER family members that include both catalytic
      PGRPs (like PGRP-SC and PGRP-SB in Drosophila) and non-catalytic receptor PGRPs. PGRP-LC
      is specifically a receptor PGRP that lacks the catalytic residues required for amidase
      activity. The correct molecular function is peptidoglycan immune receptor activity (GO:0016019).

  review:
    summary: >
      PGRPLC is primarily known as a receptor for DAP-type peptidoglycan, which is characteristic
      of Gram-negative bacteria and Bacillus species. However, experimental evidence shows
      PGRPLC-dependent survival and AMP induction against S. aureus (Gram-positive).
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >
      The deep research (file:ANOGA/PGRPLC/PGRPLC-deep-research-falcon.md) shows PGRPLC knockdown
      causes mortality after S. aureus challenge: "S. aureus, 50% by day 2 and near-complete by
      day 6." However, the primary recognized ligand is DAP-type PGN from Gram-negative bacteria.
      Gram-positive bacteria like S. aureus contain Lys-type PGN, not DAP-type. The defense
      response may be indirect or involve cross-reactivity. PGRPLC's canonical role is in sensing
      Gram-negative bacteria through the IMD pathway. A more appropriate annotation would be
      defense response to Gram-negative bacterium (GO:0050829), but the existing annotation is
      not wrong as PGRPLC does contribute to Gram-positive defense.

      However, the more specific 'immune response' (GO:0006955) annotation is preferred

      not conflict and provides a valid hierarchical annotation.

  review:
    summary: >
      This IEA annotation is based on InterPro domain IPR006619 (PGRP domain). The PGRP
      domain structure in catalytic family members coordinates a zinc ion essential for
      amidase activity. However, since PGRPLC is non-catalytic, the zinc binding function
      may not be relevant.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >
      The InterPro PGRP domain annotation (IPR006619) suggests potential zinc binding based
      on structural homology to catalytic PGRPs. However, the deep research
      (file:ANOGA/PGRPLC/PGRPLC-deep-research-falcon.md) explicitly states PGRPLC is
      non-catalytic and "no amidase activity reported." Catalytic PGRPs require zinc for
      amidase activity, but non-catalytic PGRPs may have lost critical zinc-coordinating
      residues. Without specific structural data for Anopheles PGRPLC showing zinc coordination,
      this annotation remains uncertain.

      Same rationale as for the IBA annotation above. The InterPro domains (IPR002502,
      IPR006619, IPR036505) are structural domains that can be present in both catalytic
      and non-catalytic PGRPs. PGRPLC uses this fold for peptidoglycan binding and receptor

      This annotation implies PGRPLC degrades peptidoglycan, which is incorrect. PGRPLC

    action: REMOVE
    reason: >
      This annotation is a logical consequence of the incorrect amidase activity annotation.
      Since PGRPLC is a non-catalytic receptor, it does not participate in peptidoglycan
      catabolism. It binds peptidoglycan to initiate signaling, but binding is not
      catabolism. The correct process annotation is the peptidoglycan recognition protein
      signaling pathway (GO:0061057) or immune response (file:ANOGA/PGRPLC/PGRPLC-deep-research-falcon.md).
