description: >-
  D7L1 (AngaD7L1) is a long-form D7 salivary protein from female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes
  that facilitates blood feeding by binding and sequestering host eicosanoids. Unlike short-form
  D7 proteins which bind biogenic amines (serotonin, histamine), D7L1 specifically binds
  leukotriene C4 and thromboxane A2 (tested using the stable analog U-46619). The protein
  functions as a "kratagonist" - capturing host signaling molecules with high affinity to prevent
  their vasoconstrictive, platelet-aggregating, and inflammatory effects. D7L1 inhibits U-46619-
  induced platelet aggregation and exhibits vasodilating activity. It is secreted into saliva
  during blood feeding and belongs to the PBP/GOBP (Pheromone/Odorant-Binding Protein) structural
  family but has evolved a distinct function unrelated to olfaction.

      This annotation correctly reflects the subcellular localization of D7L1 as a secreted
      salivary protein. The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference (GO_REF:0000033)
      and is consistent with experimental data showing D7 proteins are secreted into saliva.

      D7L1 is a secreted protein with a signal peptide (residues 1-21) [UniProt Q7PJ76]. It is
      released into the extracellular space (saliva) during blood feeding. The UniProt entry
      confirms "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P18153}" [UniProt Q7PJ76].
      This is an appropriate CC annotation consistent with the protein's function as a secreted
      kratagonist that sequesters host mediators at the feeding site.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is INCORRECT for D7L1. While the IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic
      inference from the PBP/GOBP family, D7L1 has evolved a completely different function. The
      protein is expressed in salivary glands, not olfactory tissues, and functions in blood
      feeding by sequestering host eicosanoids, not in olfaction.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      D7L1 belongs to the PBP/GOBP structural family (InterPro IPR006170), which led to this IBA
      annotation based on phylogenetic inference. However, the D7 long-form proteins have
      evolutionarily repurposed this fold for binding eicosanoids (leukotrienes, thromboxane) in
      saliva, not odorants in antennae. UniProt explicitly describes D7L1's function: "Modulates
      blood feeding of female mosquitoes on vertebrate species by binding and sequestering
      different mediators involved in the host response" and "Binds leukotriene C4 and U-46619,
      a stable analog of thromboxane A2" [UniProt Q7PJ76, PMID:35460690]. The protein is expressed
      exclusively in female salivary glands, not olfactory tissues. GO:0007608 definition
      "The series of events required to receive an olfactory stimulus" does not apply - D7L1 has
      no role in olfaction. This is a clear case where structural homology (driving the IBA
      annotation) does not predict function.

      This annotation accurately describes D7L1's function. The protein modulates host hemostatic
      and inflammatory responses during blood feeding by sequestering eicosanoids (leukotriene C4
      and thromboxane A2). This is a correct BP annotation for the cross-species effect.
    action: ACCEPT

      D7L1 clearly modulates processes in the vertebrate host. Per UniProt, it "Modulates blood
      feeding of female mosquitoes on vertebrate species by binding and sequestering different
      mediators involved in the host response" [UniProt Q7PJ76]. The GO:0035821 definition
      "A process in which an organism effects a change in a biological process in another organism"
      accurately captures this function. The annotation was inferred via GO_REF:0000108 from the
      toxin activity annotation, but the logic is sound - kratagonistic binding of host eicosanoids
      does modulate host processes. Specifically, D7L1 inhibits U-46619-induced platelet aggregation
      and exhibits vasodilating activity [PMID:35460690].

      This annotation is supported by experimental evidence. D7L1 exhibits vasodilating activity

      By binding and sequestering thromboxane A2 (tested using analog U-46619), D7L1 prevents
      this potent vasoconstrictor from acting on host blood vessels. The net effect is vasodilation
      at the feeding site, facilitating blood meal acquisition. GO:0042311 definition "The
      increase in the internal diameter of blood vessels" accurately describes the consequence
      of D7L1's kratagonist activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is an OVER-ANNOTATION. D7L1 does not meet the GO definition of toxin
      activity, which requires "initiating pathogenesis (leading to an abnormal, generally
      detrimental state)". D7L1 transiently modulates host physiology without causing disease
      or tissue damage.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      The GO:0090729 definition states: "Interacting selectively with one or more biological
      molecules in another (target) organism, initiating pathogenesis (leading to an abnormal,
      generally detrimental state) in the target organism." D7L1 does NOT meet this definition
      because: (1) It does not initiate pathogenesis - it facilitates feeding, not disease;
      (2) It does not cause tissue damage - it transiently sequesters host eicosanoids; (3) The
      effect is reversible and temporary; (4) The host returns to normal state after feeding.
      The UniProt keywords "Hemostasis impairing toxin" and "Platelet aggregation inhibiting toxin"
      that led to this IEA annotation via GO_REF:0000043 are technically inaccurate - anti-hemostatic
      activity is not equivalent to toxin activity. The kratagonist mechanism (sequestering
      signaling molecules) is fundamentally different from true toxins that cause pathological
      damage. Better annotations would be icosanoid binding (GO:0050542) for MF, and negative
      regulation of hemostasis (GO:1900047) for BP.

      specific than GO:0042311 (vasodilation) which is already annotated. This annotation can be
