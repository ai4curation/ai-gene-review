description: >-
  TEP10 is a thioester-containing protein (TEP) in Anopheles gambiae, a member of the expanded
  TEP family (19+ paralogs) in this malaria vector mosquito. TEPs are arthropod complement-like
  opsonins with C3/alpha-2-macroglobulin-like domain architecture including a thioester-containing
  domain (TED) with conserved GCGEQ motif. While TEP10 specifically remains poorly characterized
  with no direct experimental studies, family-based inference suggests it functions as a secreted
  hemolymph opsonin that covalently binds pathogens via its thioester bond, potentially contributing
  to immune responses including phagocytosis and melanization. TEP10 may interact with LRIM1/APL1C-type
  stabilizing complexes similar to the well-characterized TEP1.

  review:
    summary: >-
      TEP10 is annotated to immune system process based on UniProtKB keyword mapping.
      This is appropriate as TEP family proteins are key components of arthropod innate
      immunity. The well-characterized TEP1, TEP3, and TEP4 paralogs function as complement-like
      opsonins in mosquito immune responses against bacteria and Plasmodium parasites.
      While TEP10 specifically lacks direct experimental characterization,
      domain architecture and family membership support involvement in immune processes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      TEP family membership and conserved domain architecture strongly support immune function.
      The deep research states TEPs are "arthropod complement-like factors" that promote
      "phagocytosis, lysis, or melanization". The broad term "immune system process" is
      appropriately conservative for a poorly characterized paralog.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from InterPro2GO mapping of the alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M)
      domain (IPR001599) and MG2 domain (IPR002890). While vertebrate A2M proteins can
      inhibit proteases by trapping them, ARTHROPOD TEPs have functionally diverged and
      do NOT function as protease inhibitors. Instead, insect TEPs are complement C3-like
      opsonins that use their thioester bond for COVALENT attachment to pathogen surfaces
      rather than protease trapping. The InterPro2GO mapping is misleading for this
      evolutionary context.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The annotation represents an inappropriate transfer of vertebrate A2M function to
      an arthropod TEP. The deep research confirms insect TEPs function as "complement C3-like
      opsonins" rather than protease inhibitors. The UniProt function annotation explicitly
      states TEP10 "Binds covalently through a thioester bond to the pathogen surface
      resulting in pathogen clearance" - this is opsonin function, not protease inhibition.
      There is no evidence that arthropod TEPs inhibit endopeptidases; their A2M-like domains have
      been repurposed for immune opsonization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      TEP10 is annotated to extracellular region based on InterPro domain analysis
      (alpha-macroglobulin receptor-binding domain) and UniProt subcellular location
      data. TEP family proteins are secreted into the hemolymph where they function
      as opsonins. UniProt explicitly states TEP10 is "Secreted" based on ARBA annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      TEP family proteins are established hemolymph (extracellular) factors. The UniProt
      entry states "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted" and the keyword "Secreted" is present.
      The deep research confirms TEPs are "hemolymph factors produced primarily by the
      fat body/hemocytes" that "operate systemically". Signal peptide prediction and
      domain architecture support secretion.

  review:
    summary: >-
      TEP10 is annotated to extracellular space, consistent with its secreted nature
      and function as a hemolymph opsonin. This term is more specific than extracellular
      region and accurately captures hemolymph localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Hemolymph is equivalent to extracellular space in insects. The term is appropriate
      and consistent with TEP family biology. TEPs circulate in hemolymph where they
      encounter and opsonize pathogens.

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      TEP10 is predicted to function as a secreted complement-like opsonin in the mosquito
      hemolymph. Based on conserved TEP family features including the thioester-containing
      domain (TED) with GCGEQ motif, TEP10 likely binds covalently to pathogen surfaces
      via its reactive thioester, marking them for phagocytosis and/or melanotic encapsulation.
      This function has not been directly demonstrated for TEP10 but is well-established
      for paralogous TEP1, TEP3, and TEP4. NOTE: A specific molecular function term is not
      assigned because opsonization (GO:0008228) is a biological process, and no appropriate
      MF term exists for thioester-mediated pathogen binding activity.

      Does TEP10 possess a functional thioester bond capable of covalent pathogen binding,
      or has it lost this activity like some other TEP family paralogs?
  - question: >-
      Does TEP10 interact with the LRIM1/APL1C stabilizing complex, and if so,
