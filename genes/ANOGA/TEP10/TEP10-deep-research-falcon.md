## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q7PSK0
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=TEP1-F {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00078071};
- **Gene Information:** Name=TEP10 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:EAA05464.3}; ORFNames=AgaP_AGAP010819 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:EAA05464.3};
- **Organism (full):** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** A-macroglobulin_rcpt-bd. (IPR009048); A-macroglobulin_rcpt-bd_sf. (IPR036595); A2M/Complement_sys. (IPR050473); A2M_N_BRD. (IPR011625); Alpha-macroglobulin_TED. (IPR011626)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "TEP10" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'TEP10' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **TEP10** (gene ID: TEP10, UniProt: Q7PSK0) in ANOGA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Question: You are an expert researcher providing comprehensive, well-cited information.

Provide detailed information focusing on:
1. Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
2. Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023-2024 sources)
3. Current applications and real-world implementations
4. Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
5. Relevant statistics and data from recent studies

Format as a comprehensive research report with proper citations. Include URLs and publication dates where available.
Always prioritize recent, authoritative sources and provide specific citations for all major claims.

Research plan status
We verified identity and domains for the target (Q7PSK0; AGAP010819; annotated as TEP10/TEP1‑F) in Anopheles gambiae, searched recent and foundational literature, gathered evidence, and created a concise artifact summarizing identity, gaps, and cautious inferences. Below is a comprehensive research report with citations to the evidence gathered.

> - Identity: UniProt Q7PSK0 corresponds to an Anopheles gambiae TEP-family protein annotated as TEP10 / AGAP010819 (annotation shows a TEP-family/TEP1‑like naming variant); primary literature for this exact paralog was not found (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 11-12, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6)
> - Literature gap / ambiguity: No direct functional or expression studies specifically for TEP10 (AGAP010819/Q7PSK0) were retrieved; multiple sources state most AgTEP paralogs beyond TEP1/3/4 remain poorly characterized (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6, qin2025thioestercontainingproteintep15 pages 1-2)
> - Domain architecture (family evidence): AgTEPs typically have C3/A2M-like domain architecture (multiple MG domains, CUB domain, TED with conserved thioester motif GCGEQ), consistent with the UniProt/IPR domain annotations for Q7PSK0 (rono2017variationinthe pages 36-39, aoun2010analysisofthioestercontaining pages 1-2)
> - Cautious functional inference: By homology, TEP10 is likely a secreted, hemolymph-localized thioester-containing opsonin that could mediate covalent pathogen tagging (opsonization), contribute to melanization or phagocytosis, and—if structurally compatible—interact with LRIM1/APL1C-type stabilizers as seen for TEP1/TEP3 (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 11-12, yan2019complementlikeproteinstep1 pages 29-38, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 3-5)
> - Limits and recommendation: These functional assignments are inferential; empirical validation (expression/localization, proteolytic activation, thioester reactivity, LRIM1/APL1C binding and loss-of-function phenotypes) is required to confirm roles for TEP10 (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 2-3, aoun2010analysisofthioestercontaining pages 1-2)

Comprehensive research report: TEP10 (AGAP010819; UniProt Q7PSK0) in Anopheles gambiae

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Thioester‑containing proteins (TEPs) are arthropod complement‑like factors with a conserved intramolecular thioester (e.g., GCGEQ motif) embedded in a C3/A2M‑like scaffold of macroglobulin (MG) domains, a CUB domain, and a thioester‑containing domain (TED). They are typically secreted into the hemolymph and act as opsonins that covalently tag microbes or parasites to promote phagocytosis, lysis, or melanization (family‑level concept established primarily from AgTEP1) (rono2017variationinthe pages 36-39, aoun2010analysisofthioestercontaining pages 1-2, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 2-3).
- In Anopheles gambiae, the TEP family is expanded (≥19 paralogs). AgTEP1 is the best‑characterized member and is a complement C3‑like opsonin; other paralogs such as TEP3 and TEP4 have demonstrated immune roles, while many others remain poorly characterized (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 11-12, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 2-3).
- Activation and stabilization: For AgTEP1, proteolytic cleavage generates a disulfide‑linked “cut” form with exposed thioester reactivity; the LRIM1/APL1C heterodimer binds and stabilizes the cleaved TEP, directs deposition onto pathogens, and prevents off‑target damage. Related LRIM/APL1 complexes can carry other TEPs (e.g., TEP3) (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 3-5, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6, rono2017variationinthe pages 36-39).
- Localization and anatomical context: TEPs are hemolymph factors produced primarily by the fat body/hemocytes; they operate systemically and influence hemocyte aggregation at periostial regions of the heart, a hub of immune activity in mosquitoes (demonstrated for TEP1/3/4) (yan2019complementlikeproteinstep1 pages 29-38).
- Naming/identity of target: UniProt Q7PSK0 maps to An. gambiae AGAP010819, annotated as TEP10, with a naming note referencing “TEP1‑F,” indicating historical/annotation ambiguity within the TEP family. Domain annotations match the C3/A2M‑like TEP architecture (A2M_N, TED, A‑macroglobulin receptor‑binding) (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 11-12, rono2017variationinthe pages 36-39).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- Family/system updates: Recent studies continue to emphasize TEP1 as a central opsonin and report expression changes of TEP family members in various contexts, including insecticide resistance and salivary gland infections; however, TEP10‑specific data remain absent in the 2023–2024 literature retrieved here (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 15-16). For example, 2024 transcriptomics in field mosquitoes noted TEP family gene overexpression associated with resistance phenotypes and highlighted the immunological importance of TEPs broadly, though mechanistic assignments are focused on TEP1/3/4 (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 15-16).
- Periostial immunity: Foundational but still relevant, TEP1/3/4 were shown to promote periostial hemocyte aggregation and regulate melanin deposition at the heart ostia after infection, highlighting a coordinated complement‑like and cellular response interface (yan2019complementlikeproteinstep1 pages 29-38).
- Structural/interaction paradigms (ongoing relevance): Mechanistic studies detailing LRIM1/APL1C complex formation with TEP1, and the capacity to carry other TEPs (e.g., TEP3), continue to serve as the primary model for how mosquito complement‑like opsonins are stabilized and targeted (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 3-5, rono2017variationinthe pages 36-39).
- Gap for TEP10: No primary studies from 2023–2024 specifically addressing AGAP010819/TEP10 function, expression, or localization were identified in the retrieved evidence set; reviews emphasize that many AgTEP paralogs remain to be characterized (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 2-3).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Vector competence and transmission‑blocking: AgTEP1 is integral to mosquito resistance to Plasmodium; population studies and functional assays link TEP1 allelic variation to parasite outcomes. These paradigms inform genetic/vector‑control strategies that seek to leverage or enhance endogenous complement‑like immunity, but such applications are built on TEP1/3/4 evidence and cannot yet be extended specifically to TEP10 without data (rono2017variationinthe pages 36-39, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 11-12).
- Systems immunology and surveillance: Transcriptomic and proteomic screens increasingly include TEPs as biomarkers of immune activation or insecticide exposure in field mosquitoes, underscoring their broader relevance to resistance management; however, paralog‑specific functional roles remain unresolved for many TEPs including TEP10 (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 15-16, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Reviews synthesizing Anopheles TEP biology agree that AgTEP1 is a C3‑like opsonin stabilized by LRIM1/APL1C and that multiple TEP paralogs exist with diverse and incompletely defined roles; most paralogs (AgTEP2–19) are still poorly characterized (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 11-12, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 2-3).
- Foundational mechanistic work on LRIM1/APL1C–TEP1 interaction and TEP1 structural allelic differences underpins the model for complement‑like effector action and allele‑specific vector competence, serving as the framework for inferring, but not asserting, similar features in other AgTEPs (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 3-5, rono2017variationinthe pages 36-39).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Periostial aggregation roles: RNAi knockdown studies showed that TEP1, TEP3, and TEP4 positively regulate periostial hemocyte aggregation and melanin deposition at the heart’s ostia after infection; TEP1 also reduces systemic bacterial loads, supporting a broad antibacterial role (statistics reported via two‑way ANOVA in the study) (yan2019complementlikeproteinstep1 pages 29-38).
- Structural/activation insights: Structural and biochemical studies establish that TEP1 exists as a ~165 kDa precursor cleaved into disulfide‑linked chains; the cleaved form binds pathogens via an exposed thioester and requires LRIM1/APL1C for stabilization and pathogen targeting (rono2017variationinthe pages 36-39, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 3-5).
- Knowledge gap quantified: Reviews state explicitly that the “biological functions of other AgTEP members (AgTEP2–19) remain largely unexplored,” highlighting a major annotation deficit relevant to TEP10 (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6).

Functional annotation for TEP10 (Q7PSK0; AGAP010819) with confidence statements
- Verified identity and domains: Q7PSK0 encodes an An. gambiae thioester‑containing protein annotated as TEP10; domain signatures align with C3/A2M‑like TEPs (A2M_N, TED, A‑macroglobulin receptor‑binding), consistent with a secreted complement‑like opsonin (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 11-12, rono2017variationinthe pages 36-39).
- Localization (inferred): By family analogy, TEP10 is likely secreted into the hemolymph (produced by fat body/hemocytes) and may act systemically; specific cellular or tissue localization data for TEP10 were not retrieved (rono2017variationinthe pages 36-39, aoun2010analysisofthioestercontaining pages 1-2, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6).
- Biochemical mechanism (inferred): Likely possesses a reactive thioester enabling covalent attachment to pathogen surfaces following proteolytic activation. Potential to be stabilized/carried by LRIM1/APL1C‑like complexes if compatible, as shown for TEP1 and some other TEPs (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 3-5, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6). These remain hypotheses absent TEP10‑specific assays.
- Pathways (inferred): May participate in the mosquito complement‑like pathway that culminates in opsonization, phagocytosis, and/or melanization; TEP family members TEP1/3/4 influence periostial immune cell aggregation and melanotic encapsulation, suggesting a possible role sphere for other TEPs, but TEP10’s precise role is unknown (yan2019complementlikeproteinstep1 pages 29-38, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 11-12).

Ambiguity and precautions
- The gene symbol “TEP10” is not well represented in current literature for An. gambiae; no direct TEP10 experimental studies were found in the retrieved set. Therefore, any functional statements beyond domain‑based inference must be treated as hypotheses pending empirical validation (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 2-3).

Evidence‑based next steps
- Experimental: Determine TEP10 expression (qPCR/RNA‑seq across tissues and infection states), secretion to hemolymph (western blot/shotgun proteomics), proteolytic processing and thioester reactivity (mass spectrometry/chemical capture), LRIM1/APL1C binding (co‑IP/SEC‑MALS), pathogen binding (immunofluorescence on bacteria/ookinetes), and functional impact (RNAi/CRISPR knockouts with bacterial and Plasmodium challenges) (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 11-12, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6, yan2019complementlikeproteinstep1 pages 29-38).
- Comparative/phylogenetic: Place TEP10 within AgTEP clades to anticipate interaction partners and mechanisms (C3‑like vs A2M‑like), leveraging the established architecture for TEP1 and other family members (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 5-6, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 2-3).

Conclusion
- Identity verified: Q7PSK0 encodes an An. gambiae TEP family protein annotated as TEP10 with C3/A2M‑like domains. However, TEP10‑specific literature is currently limited; most functional insights derive from better‑studied paralogs (TEP1/3/4). We provide a cautious, domain‑ and family‑based functional annotation and explicit recommendations for experiments to resolve TEP10’s role in the mosquito complement‑like pathway (li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 11-12, yan2019complementlikeproteinstep1 pages 29-38, li2025comparativeimmunologicalroles pages 3-5, rono2017variationinthe pages 36-39).
