description: >
  D7r5 is a member of the short-form D7 salivary protein family in Anopheles gambiae.
  Critically, unlike other D7 proteins that bind biogenic amines (serotonin, histamine,
  norepinephrine) to facilitate blood feeding, D7r5 does NOT bind these compounds.
  The protein is poorly expressed in salivary glands and may be on the evolutionary
  path to becoming a pseudogene. Its actual function, if any, remains unknown.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >
      The IBA annotation for extracellular space is based on phylogenetic inference from
      related D7 proteins. UniProt indicates D7r5 is secreted, and the protein has a
      signal peptide (residues 1-22). While D7r5 is poorly expressed (PMID:16301315),
      when expressed it would be expected to be secreted like other D7 family members.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      The extracellular localization is consistent with the protein having a signal
      peptide and being a member of the secreted D7 salivary protein family. Even
      though D7r5 may be functionally divergent or degenerating, its structural
      features support extracellular localization.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >
      This IBA annotation propagates from odorant-binding protein (OBP) family members
      in Drosophila that function in olfaction. However, D7 proteins are salivary
      proteins involved in blood feeding, not olfactory receptors. D7r5 specifically
      has been shown experimentally to NOT bind biogenic amines (PMID:16301315), and
      there is no evidence it functions in sensory perception of smell.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >
      This annotation is incorrectly propagated. D7 salivary proteins, while distantly
      related to the OBP superfamily, have evolved distinct functions in blood feeding
      (binding biogenic amines to antagonize host hemostatic responses). D7r5
      specifically does not even perform this function - it is "The nonbinding D7
      protein" that "is poorly expressed in the salivary glands and appears to be on
      the path to becoming a pseudogene" (PMID:16301315). There is no experimental or
      logical basis for sensory perception of smell annotation.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >
      This IEA annotation is based on InterPro domain assignment (IPR006170 PBP/GOBP
      family). While D7r5 belongs to the pheromone/general odorant-binding protein
      superfamily structurally, experimental evidence directly contradicts any binding
      function for this protein. PMID:16301315 explicitly tested D7r5 and found it
      does NOT bind biogenic amines, unlike other D7 proteins.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >
      This is a clear over-annotation based on domain homology that contradicts
      experimental evidence. The original study (PMID:16301315) specifically tested
      binding using isothermal microcalorimetry and chromatographic methods, finding
      that "four of these five short D7 proteins...bind serotonin with high affinity,
      as well as histamine and norepinephrine. The nonbinding D7 protein [D7r5] is
      poorly expressed in the salivary glands and appears to be on the path to
      becoming a pseudogene." Structural similarity to OBPs does not confer odorant
      binding function - D7r5 has lost or never had functional binding activity.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: >
      This IEA annotation is based on UniProt subcellular location annotation indicating
      the protein is secreted. D7r5 has a predicted signal peptide and belongs to the
      secreted D7 salivary protein family. This is a broader term than GO:0005615
      (extracellular space) which is already annotated via IBA.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      The extracellular region annotation is consistent with structural features
      (signal peptide) and family membership. While D7r5 is poorly expressed and may
      be degenerating, when expressed it would be secreted. This broader CC term is
      appropriately supported by the UniProt secreted annotation.

        This reference supports IEA annotations based on InterPro domain assignments.
        For D7r5, the PBP/GOBP domain leads to odorant binding annotation, but this
        conflicts with experimental evidence showing D7r5 does not bind ligands.

core_functions:
  - description: >
      D7r5 has no known molecular function. Unlike other D7 salivary proteins that
      bind biogenic amines (serotonin, histamine, norepinephrine) to facilitate blood
      feeding by antagonizing host hemostatic responses, D7r5 has lost this binding
      capacity. The protein is poorly expressed and may represent a degenerating
      pseudogene or a protein evolving toward a novel, as-yet-unknown function.

    hypothesis: If D7r5 is becoming a pseudogene, it should show relaxed selection (dN/dS approaching 1)
