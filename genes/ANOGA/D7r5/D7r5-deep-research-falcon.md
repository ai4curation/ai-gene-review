## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q7PN86
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Short form salivary protein D7R5 {ECO:0000305}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=D7r5 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:16301315}; ORFNames=AgaP_AGAP008280 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:EAA12585.2};
- **Organism (full):** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the PBP/GOBP family. .
- **Key Domains:** PBP/GOBP. (IPR006170); PBP_GOBP_sf. (IPR036728); PBP_GOBP (PF01395)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "D7r5" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'D7r5' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **D7r5** (gene ID: D7r5, UniProt: Q7PN86) in ANOGA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: D7r5 (AGAP008280; UniProt Q7PN86) in Anopheles gambiae

1) Key concepts and definitions
Identity and family. D7r5 is one of five short-form D7 paralogs (D7r1–D7r5) encoded in the Anopheles gambiae salivary D7 locus on chromosome 3R; D7 proteins are female salivary gland–specific and part of the odorant-binding protein (OBP; PBP/GOBP-related) superfamily co-opted for hematophagy (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 2-3, arca2017anophelinesalivaryprotein pages 7-9). Short-form D7s contain a single OBP-like domain; long-form D7s contain two domains with distinct ligand pockets (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1, arca2017anophelinesalivaryprotein pages 7-9).
Definition of function class. Mosquito D7s are kratagonists that bind and sequester vertebrate pro-hemostatic and pro-inflammatory mediators (biogenic amines, leukotrienes, thromboxanes), thereby aiding blood feeding (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 5-6, calvo2006functionandevolution pages 3-4).

2) Biochemical function and ligand specificity of D7r5
Short-form D7 paralogs D7r1–D7r4 bind serotonin with low-nanomolar affinity and also histamine and norepinephrine to varying degrees, antagonizing smooth-muscle and platelet responses in vitro; in contrast, D7r5 does not measurably bind serotonin or histamine by ITC/spectral assays and shows no antagonism in smooth-muscle assays at micromolar concentrations (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 3-4). Foundational analyses concluded D7r5 is poorly expressed and may be functionally degenerating toward pseudogene status (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 5-6, calvo2006functionandevolution pages 7-8). Structural data from a closely related paralog (D7r4) show the canonical D7 short-form fold (eight helices; three disulfides; OBP-like pocket) responsible for amine binding; reports note D7r5 lacks detectable amine-binding activity under the same conditions (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1). No anticoagulant activity was detected for D7r5, unlike the D7r1/hamadarin branch that can interfere with bradykinin generation (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 7-8).
Quantitative context. For binding paralogs, serotonin Kd values are reported in the low nanomolar range; D7r4’s NE affinity is weaker (approximate Kd ~0.65 µM). D7r5 was inactive at 1.5 µM in functional antagonism assays (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 3-4). These results imply that, unlike its paralogs, D7r5 likely does not contribute to biogenic-amine scavenging at the bite site.

3) Localization and expression
Transcriptomics placed D7r5 within the short-form cassette (D7r1–D7r5) and indicated D7r5 is among the least represented transcripts (few ESTs), consistent with low expression (arca2005anupdatedcatalogue pages 7-8). Proteomics of An. gambiae salivary glands and saliva lists D7r5 among saliva proteins but at lower relative abundance than other D7s, supporting secretion yet suggesting limited contribution to salivary pharmacology (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1, arca2005anupdatedcatalogue pages 7-8). Expression is female-specific in salivary glands (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 2-3).

4) Biological role and pathway context
General D7 pathway role. D7 proteins act extracellularly at the host bite site, binding host mediators to suppress vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, pain, and inflammation, thereby facilitating blood meal acquisition (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 5-6). Long-form D7s bind cysteinyl leukotrienes and sometimes thromboxane A2; short-form D7s bind biogenic amines. Given the lack of detected amine binding, D7r5 likely does not participate in these canonical antihemostatic pathways, and may represent a degenerating paralog in the dynamic D7 gene family (arca2017anophelinesalivaryprotein pages 7-9, calvo2006functionandevolution pages 7-8). No distinct alternative biochemical activity has been verified for D7r5 to date.

5) Evolutionary and regulatory genomics context
The Anopheles D7 locus shows tandem duplication and divergence, with short-form paralogs specializing for amine binding and occasional acquisition of novel activities (e.g., D7r1/hamadarin anti-kinin/anticlotting). Comparative genomics across 16 Anopheles species indicates D7r5 is consistently lowly transcribed and possibly degenerating, while other paralogs retain strong signatures of function (arca2017anophelinesalivaryprotein pages 7-9). Recent allele-specific expression analysis in An. gambiae identified cis-regulatory differences affecting D7r2 and D7r4 expression, highlighting that salivary D7 expression is subject to cis variation; this provides a framework to investigate whether D7r5’s low expression is driven by cis regulatory changes (koseoglu2025insilicoanalyzing pages 10-12).

6) Recent developments and latest research (prioritized 2023–2024)
- Biomarkers of exposure. Anti-D7 IgG responses are used to infer human–vector contact. In An. gambiae, D7L2 and several short-form D7s elicit robust IgG; D7L2 antibody levels correlate with age and are lower in bednet users, supporting utility as an exposure biomarker and for monitoring interventions (Parasites & Vectors, 2022; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-05130-5) (oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2). Systematic reviews and 2023–2024 commentaries reiterate D7s’ value in exposure serology (Pathogens 2023; PLoS NTDs 2024) (marinlopez2023mosquitosalivaryproteins pages 14-16).
- Vaccines targeting saliva. Reviews in 2023–2024 summarize progress in salivary antigen vaccines, positioning D7 family proteins among candidates; multiple early-phase clinical studies with saliva-based constructs underscore translational interest (Pathogens 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens12030371; PLoS NTDs 2024, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012618) (marinlopez2023mosquitosalivaryproteins pages 14-16).
- Functional genetics (contextual to D7 family). CRISPR knockouts of Aedes aegypti D7 long forms lengthen probing time and reduce Plasmodium oocyst burden, demonstrating in vivo roles for D7s in blood feeding and infection; while not An. gambiae, these data strengthen the mechanistic paradigm for D7 family proteins (mBio 2023; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02289-23) (martinmartin2023aedesaegyptid7 pages 16-17).
- Regulatory genomics in An. gambiae (2024). Allele-specific expression mapping identified D7 salivary genes (D7r2, D7r4) among ASE genes, implying cis-regulatory polymorphisms modulate D7 expression in relevant tissues (Proc. R. Soc. B 2024; https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2024.1142) (koseoglu2025insilicoanalyzing pages 10-12).

7) Current applications and implementations
- Exposure serology: recombinant D7 antigens (notably D7L2; short forms D7r1–D7r4) are used to gauge human exposure to Anopheles bites and evaluate vector control (bednet use), with field data supporting their responsiveness to transmission intensity (oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).
- Structural/biochemical templates: D7 folds and binding pockets inform ligand-mimetic and antagonist design; however, D7r5 itself lacks confirmed ligand-binding and is not a current applied biomarker antigen (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1, calvo2006functionandevolution pages 3-4).
- Prospective vaccines: D7 proteins are considered in saliva-based vaccine strategies; current evidence is largely preclinical/early clinical and focused more on Aedes spp. and long-form D7s; analogous anopheline efforts are under discussion (marinlopez2023mosquitosalivaryproteins pages 14-16).

8) Relevant statistics and data
- Binding: For active short-form D7s (not D7r5), serotonin Kd values are low nM; NE binding varies with paralog (e.g., D7r4 Kd ~0.65 µM). D7r5 inactive at 1.5 µM in smooth muscle assays (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 3-4).
- Expression: D7r5 exhibited the lowest EST representation among the short-form D7s in salivary-gland cDNA libraries (qualitative), consistent with low salivary abundance (arca2005anupdatedcatalogue pages 7-8). Proteomics detected D7r5 in saliva but at low abundance (qualitative) (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1).
- Serology: D7L2 IgG increased with age and was reduced in bednet users in East African cohorts (study-level summary; details within Parasites & Vectors 2022) (oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).

9) Expert opinions and analysis
Consensus from structural and functional studies is that D7s act as kratagonists of host mediators at the bite site; the short-form D7 family in An. gambiae includes one poorly expressed, functionally inert paralog (D7r5) that likely represents a degenerating gene in a rapidly evolving salivary gene cluster (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 5-6, arca2017anophelinesalivaryprotein pages 7-9). Recent regulatory-genomic findings indicate that expression variation among D7 paralogs can be driven by cis elements, meriting targeted regulatory and epigenetic profiling of the D7r5 locus to resolve whether its low expression is due to promoter/cis decay versus selective silencing (koseoglu2025insilicoanalyzing pages 10-12).

10) Mandatory verification
- Gene/protein match: D7r5 is a short-form salivary D7 protein encoded by AGAP008280 in Anopheles gambiae; UniProt Q7PN86 matches this identity (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 2-3, arca2005anupdatedcatalogue pages 7-8).
- Organism: Correct organism is Anopheles gambiae; all cited D7r paralog work references the An. gambiae D7 cluster (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 2-3, arca2017anophelinesalivaryprotein pages 7-9).
- Family/domains: D7 proteins are distantly related to odorant-binding proteins (PBP/GOBP-related fold) (calvo2006functionandevolution pages 1-1, mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1, arca2017anophelinesalivaryprotein pages 7-9).
- Ambiguity check: No alternative gene with symbol D7r5 in a different organism was used; all evidence pertains to An. gambiae D7 family.

Limitations and open questions
- No confirmed ligand or alternative biochemical activity for D7r5 has been validated since the foundational studies; its role may be negligible or specialized under conditions not yet assayed. Focused ligand screens (e.g., nucleotides, peptides, lipids beyond biogenic amines/eicosanoids) and structural studies of D7r5 could test residual or novel binding. Regulatory mapping (ATAC-seq/ChIP-seq) around AGAP008280 could clarify whether promoter/enhancer decay explains low expression (koseoglu2025insilicoanalyzing pages 10-12).
