description: >-
  PGRP-LD is a long-form peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) that functions as a
  non-catalytic, negative regulator of innate immune responses in the mosquito gut.
  Despite containing an Amidase_2/PGRP domain, PGRP-LD lacks the conserved residues
  required for peptidoglycan binding and amidase catalytic activity. Instead, it acts
  to restrain immune hyper-activation, thereby preserving gut commensal microbiota
  and maintaining peritrophic matrix integrity. This microbiota-PM barrier axis
  indirectly limits Plasmodium infection. PGRP-LD is a transmembrane protein localized
  at the gut epithelial barrier.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      PGRP-LD is involved in immune system processes. Deep research synthesis indicates
      that PGRP-LD modulates gut immunity by restraining hyper-activation of immune
      effectors, thereby maintaining microbiota homeostasis and peritrophic matrix
      integrity. This is supported by functional studies in the closely related
      Anopheles stephensi ortholog.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is correct but very broad. PGRP-LD plays a regulatory role in innate
      immunity at the gut barrier. The term is appropriately general for an IEA annotation
      derived from UniProt keyword mapping.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      The PGRP/Amidase_2 domain family typically coordinates a zinc ion at the active site.
      However, PGRP-LD lacks the conserved residues required for catalytic activity, raising
      the question of whether the zinc-binding site is functional. Sequence analysis shows
      that PGRP-LD lacks most conserved residues for PGN binding and catalytic activity.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      While catalytic PGRPs bind zinc at the active site, the absence of key catalytic
      residues in PGRP-LD raises uncertainty about whether zinc binding is retained.
      No direct experimental evidence confirms zinc binding in this non-catalytic PGRP.
      The annotation may be a case of domain-based over-annotation.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is INCORRECT. Despite belonging to the Amidase_2/PGRP superfamily,
      PGRP-LD is a non-catalytic PGRP that lacks the conserved residues required for
      peptidoglycan binding and amidase catalytic activity. Sequence analysis of the
      Anopheles stephensi ortholog demonstrated the absence of key catalytic residues.
      PGRP-LD functions as a regulatory PGRP rather than an enzymatic amidase.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This is a classic example of domain-based over-annotation. The presence of an
      Amidase_2 domain (IPR002502) led to automatic annotation of amidase activity,
      but detailed sequence analysis shows PGRP-LD lacks the conserved residues required
      for catalysis. Not all PGRP family members are enzymatically active; many function
      as pattern recognition receptors or immune regulators without catalytic activity.
      The functional evidence clearly indicates PGRP-LD is non-catalytic.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is INCORRECT. Peptidoglycan catabolic process implies enzymatic
      degradation of peptidoglycan, which requires amidase activity. Since PGRP-LD
      lacks the conserved catalytic residues and does not function as an active amidase,
      it cannot be involved in peptidoglycan catabolism. The protein may recognize
      peptidoglycan as a pattern recognition molecule, but does not degrade it.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation logically follows from the incorrect amidase activity annotation.
      Since PGRP-LD lacks amidase catalytic activity, it cannot participate in
      peptidoglycan catabolic processes. The annotation should be removed along with
      the amidase activity annotation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      PGRP-LD is clearly involved in the innate immune response. However, it functions
      as a NEGATIVE regulator rather than a positive effector. RNAi knockdown of PGRP-LD
      upregulates multiple immune effectors (cecropin, gambicin, defensin, DUOX),
      indicating its normal function is to restrain immune activation. This immune
      tolerance function preserves commensal bacteria and maintains peritrophic matrix
      integrity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While PGRP-LD is involved in innate immune response, a more accurate annotation
      would capture its specific role as a negative regulator. The current annotation
      is not wrong but could be more informative about the direction of regulation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      PGRP-LD functions as an inhibitor of immune signaling pathways. By restraining
      the activity of Imd/Toll signaling, it prevents hyper-activation of downstream
      immune effectors. This inhibitory molecular function underlies its biological
      role in negative regulation of innate immunity.

      This molecular function term captures PGRP-LD's role as an inhibitor of immune
      signaling. While the precise molecular mechanism is not fully characterized,
      the functional evidence clearly demonstrates inhibitory activity on immune
      pathway components.
