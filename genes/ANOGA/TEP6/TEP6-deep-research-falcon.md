## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q7Q251
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=TEP1-F {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00078071};
- **Gene Information:** Name=TEP6 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:EAA13729.2}; Synonyms=1278851 {ECO:0000313|EnsemblMetazoa:AGAP010814-PA}; ORFNames=AgaP_AGAP010814 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:EAA13729.2};
- **Organism (full):** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** A-macroglobulin_rcpt-bd. (IPR009048); A-macroglobulin_rcpt-bd_sf. (IPR036595); A2M/Complement_sys. (IPR050473); A2M_N_BRD. (IPR011625); Alpha-macroglobulin_TED. (IPR011626)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "TEP6" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'TEP6' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **TEP6** (gene ID: TEP6, UniProt: Q7Q251) in ANOGA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

2. Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023-2024 sources)
3. Current applications and real-world implementations
4. Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
5. Relevant statistics and data from recent studies

*Table: Compact summary of verified identity, inferred features, pathway context, evolutionary relationships, experimental phenotypes (TEP1 reference) and recent mentions for Anopheles gambiae TEP6 (AGAP010814; UniProt Q7Q251), with source links to the extracted context IDs.*

Executive verification: target gene/protein identity
- Gene symbol and protein match: TEP6 corresponds to AGAP010814 in Anopheles gambiae; UniProt Q7Q251. TEP6 is a member of the insect thioester-containing protein (TEP) family, homologous to α2-macroglobulins/complement proteins (A2M-like) and carrying a thioester-containing (TED) domain. The symbol overlaps historically with Anopheles TEP nomenclature, but AGAP010814/TEP6 is clearly an Anopheles gambiae TEP family member in the literature and genomic annotations (TEP1–TEP15 family). Identity and organism therefore match the context provided. This is consistent with evolutionary analyses of the An. gambiae TEP repertoire (Obbard 2008). (obbard2008theevolutionof pages 1-2)

- Ambiguity note: The symbol “TEP6” is used only within the Anopheles TEP family here. We did not proceed on similarly named genes from other organisms.

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Thioester-containing proteins (TEPs) in mosquitoes are secreted α2-macroglobulin/complement-like proteins that circulate in hemolymph and, upon proteolytic activation, can covalently tag pathogen surfaces via the reactive thioester in the TED domain. TEP1 is the best-characterized member in An. gambiae, secreted mainly from the fat body, present in hemolymph, taken up by hemocytes upon challenge, and required for parasite killing/melanization. These properties define the canonical complement-like pathway in Anopheles. (Volohonsky 2017) URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006113 (Published Jan 17, 2017) (volohonsky2017transgenicexpressionof pages 1-2)

- LRIM/APL1 leucine-rich repeat proteins regulate the activation and deployment of TEP1: LRIM1 and APL1C form disulfide-linked coiled-coil heterodimers that act as scaffolds/chaperones for TEP1 and are essential for its antiparasitic activity, positioning TEPs within a modular complement-like system in mosquitoes. (Zmarlak 2021) (zmarlak2021regulationofimmunea pages 43-49)

- Genomic context of TEP6: The An. gambiae genome contains ~15 TEP loci. TEP1’s sequence mosaicism reflects gene conversion with TEP6-like and TEP5-like sequences, indicating close evolutionary proximity of TEP6 to TEP1 across substantial regions, including part of the TED domain. This supports functional relatedness within the family. (Obbard 2008) URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-8-274 (Published Oct 27, 2008) (obbard2008theevolutionof pages 2-4, obbard2008theevolutionof pages 1-2)

- Domains and inferred biochemistry for TEP6: Based on UniProt (provided) and the TEP family, TEP6 contains the A2M_N bait region, thioester (TED) domain, and A-macroglobulin receptor-binding region, consistent with secreted complement-like proteins. No direct biochemical assay for TEP6 was retrieved here; the function is inferred from family/domain conservation and proximity to TEP1 in evolutionary analyses. (obbard2008theevolutionof pages 2-4, obbard2008theevolutionof pages 1-2)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Field transcriptomics in 2024 (Anopheles coluzzii) characterized resistance phenotypes and gene expression programs in Central Africa; while focused on insecticide resistance, these data provide an updated immune/transcriptomic landscape in major malaria vectors. The study reported extremely high pyrethroid/DDT resistance with 0% mortality at 1× permethrin and partial recovery with synergists; transcriptomic analyses identified hundreds of DE genes, including immune and protease modules frequently linked to hemolymph immunity. TEP6 (AGAP010814) appears among immune gene lists in this context (as indicated by the study’s gene lists and summaries), though no TEP6-specific functional phenotype was reported. URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.13641 (Published Feb 2024) (fadel2024exploringthemolecular pages 5-6, fadel2024exploringthemolecular pages 3-5)

- Continued synthesis of the complement-like pathway: Reviews and theses up to 2021 reiterate the LRIM/APL1–TEP axis, emphasizing secretion to the hemolymph and regulated activation of TEP1. This framework remains the most authoritative mechanistic context for uncharacterized TEPs, including TEP6. (Zmarlak 2021) (zmarlak2021regulationofimmunea pages 43-49)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Transgenic manipulation of TEP1 in An. gambiae: Fat-body expression of the refractory TEP1r allele rescues TEP1 loss-of-function and reduces parasite numbers, yet overexpression in a wild-type background did not further increase resistance. This implementation demonstrates the feasibility and constraints of leveraging the mosquito complement-like pathway for vector control traits and serves as a functional model applicable to studying related TEPs such as TEP6. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006113 (Jan 17, 2017) (volohonsky2017transgenicexpressionof pages 1-2)

- Hemocyte-focused functional screens: Although not specific to TEP6, hemocyte RNAi screens in An. gambiae established robust cell-based and in vivo pipelines for identifying immune regulators of phagocytosis, LRIM1 expression, and anti-Plasmodium responses, providing assay paradigms for future TEP6 functional analysis. URLs: PLoS Pathog 2013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003145 (Jan 10, 2013); Parasites & Vectors 2016 https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1359-y (Feb 2016) (lombardo2013comprehensivegeneticdissection pages 3-5, lombardo2016novelfactorsof pages 1-2)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Complement-like immunity in Anopheles is built around TEP1 interacting with LRIM/APL1 complexes; secreted TEPs require proper maturation and chaperoning to bind pathogens. This conceptual scaffold places TEP6—bearing conserved A2M/TED domains and closely related to TEP1 by gene conversion—within the same broad functional class, likely a secreted hemolymph factor with potential pathogen-binding capacity, pending direct experimentation. (Zmarlak 2021; Obbard 2008; Volohonsky 2017) (zmarlak2021regulationofimmunea pages 43-49, obbard2008theevolutionof pages 1-2, volohonsky2017transgenicexpressionof pages 1-2)

- Evolutionary mosaicism and gene conversion between TEP1 and TEP6-like sequences argue that selective pressures on parasite interactions can remodel TEP loci; this supports the hypothesis that TEP6 may contribute to complement-like defense but with target specificity and regulation that may differ from TEP1. (Obbard 2008) URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-8-274 (Oct 27, 2008) (obbard2008theevolutionof pages 2-4, obbard2008theevolutionof pages 1-2)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- 2024 field phenotyping (Cameroon, An. coluzzii): 0% mortality for 1× permethrin; 11% and 33% mortalities at 5× and 10×, respectively; synergist PBO increased permethrin mortality to 53% (5×) and 87% (10×), and DEM increased mortality for 1× permethrin to 35% and for DDT to 15%, demonstrating metabolic resistance profiles and providing a contemporary transcriptomic backdrop for immune gene expression (including TEP family genes). URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.13641 (Feb 2024) (fadel2024exploringthemolecular pages 5-6)

- TEP pathway localization/function references: TEP1 is expressed in the fat body, circulates in hemolymph, and binds parasites in its cleaved form; transgenic TEP1r reduces parasite load and induces melanization in mutant backgrounds, quantitatively confirming pathway impact in vivo. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006113 (Jan 17, 2017) (volohonsky2017transgenicexpressionof pages 1-2)

Functional annotation of TEP6 (Q7Q251; AGAP010814): precise role, localization, and pathways
- Molecular function: No direct experimental assay was retrieved for TEP6. By domain conservation (A2M_N bait region; TED; A-macroglobulin receptor-binding) and close evolutionary relationship to TEP1, TEP6 is most plausibly a secreted thioester protein capable of covalent pathogen tagging in hemolymph; however, substrate specificity (microbial class, parasite stage) and activation protease(s) are unreported here and remain to be experimentally defined. (Obbard 2008; TEP1 experimental context: Volohonsky 2017; LRIM/APL1 pathway: Zmarlak 2021) (obbard2008theevolutionof pages 1-2, volohonsky2017transgenicexpressionof pages 1-2, zmarlak2021regulationofimmunea pages 43-49)

- Cellular/organismal localization: By analogy to TEP1 and the TEP/LRIM/APL1 complement-like axis, TEP6 is predicted to be secreted to the hemolymph (likely fat-body derived) and to interact with hemocytes upon immune challenge; direct TEP6 localization data were not found in the retrieved sources. (Volohonsky 2017; Zmarlak 2021) (volohonsky2017transgenicexpressionof pages 1-2, zmarlak2021regulationofimmunea pages 43-49)

- Pathway interactions: The principal complement-like pathway in Anopheles is the LRIM1/APL1C–TEP1 axis. Evolutionary exchange between TEP1 and TEP6-like sequences suggests potential mechanistic parallels or shared regulatory modules, but specific TEP6 interactions with LRIM/APL1 have not been shown in the sources retrieved. (Obbard 2008; Zmarlak 2021) (obbard2008theevolutionof pages 1-2, zmarlak2021regulationofimmunea pages 43-49)

- Phenotypes: No TEP6-specific RNAi/knockout phenotype was recovered in the sources retrieved here. In contrast, TEP1 loss-of-function or allele manipulations produce strong changes in Plasmodium survival and melanization, providing a benchmark for future TEP6 functional studies. (Volohonsky 2017) (volohonsky2017transgenicexpressionof pages 1-2)

- Recent transcriptomics: A 2024 field RNA-seq study provides current gene expression context in a major vector; while focused on resistance, it underscores the ongoing utility of population-scale transcriptomics to profile immune genes such as TEPs in natural settings. No TEP6-specific differential expression statistic is quoted in the retrieved excerpts. URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.13641 (Feb 2024) (fadel2024exploringthemolecular pages 5-6, fadel2024exploringthemolecular pages 3-5)

Evidence limitations and guidance
- The gene symbol “TEP6” is not ambiguous within the Anopheles gambiae TEP family, but literature directly dissecting AGAP010814’s function remains sparse in the retrieved set. Accordingly, key aspects of the TEP6 annotation here are reasoned from (a) conserved domain architecture; (b) evolutionary mosaicism with TEP1; and (c) the established LRIM/APL1–TEP1 complement-like paradigm. Direct biochemical assays, binding targets, activation proteases, and loss-of-function phenotypes specific to TEP6 remain open and recommended for targeted study using hemocyte assays and fat-body expression systems demonstrated for TEP1. (Obbard 2008; Volohonsky 2017; Zmarlak 2021; Lombardo 2013, 2016) (obbard2008theevolutionof pages 1-2, volohonsky2017transgenicexpressionof pages 1-2, zmarlak2021regulationofimmunea pages 43-49, lombardo2013comprehensivegeneticdissection pages 3-5, lombardo2016novelfactorsof pages 1-2)

Conclusion
- TEP6 (AGAP010814; Q7Q251) belongs to the secreted, hemolymph-resident A2M/complement-like TEP family in An. gambiae. Although direct experimental function and phenotypes for TEP6 were not uncovered here, evolutionary evidence linking TEP6 to TEP1 and the conserved domain architecture strongly suggest a role analogous to other TEPs in complement-like immunity. The established LRIM/APL1–TEP1 axis, transgenic TEP1 implementations, and modern hemocyte functional genomics provide rigorous models and methods to define TEP6’s precise substrates, activation, and in vivo role in parasite control.
