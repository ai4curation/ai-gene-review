description: >-
  TEP6 (thioester-containing protein 6) is a member of the insect TEP family in Anopheles gambiae,
  which are secreted complement-like proteins that circulate in the hemolymph and function in innate
  immunity. TEP proteins contain alpha-2-macroglobulin-like domains including a thioester-containing
  domain (TED) that enables covalent binding to pathogen surfaces. Unlike vertebrate alpha-2-macroglobulins
  which function as protease inhibitors, insect TEPs function primarily as opsonins in complement-like
  immunity. TEP6 shows evolutionary mosaicism with TEP1 through gene conversion events, suggesting
  functional relatedness within the family. Direct experimental characterization of TEP6 is lacking,
  but its domain architecture and evolutionary relationship to the well-characterized TEP1 suggest
  a role in hemolymph-mediated pathogen recognition and clearance.

  review:
    summary: >-
      TEP6 is a member of the insect thioester-containing protein family, which functions in
      complement-like innate immunity. While TEP6 itself lacks direct experimental characterization,
      its membership in the TEP family and conserved domain architecture strongly support an immune
      function. The annotation is based on the UniProt keyword "Immunity" which is appropriate given
      the well-established immune roles of TEP family members, particularly the extensively studied
      TEP1 which functions in anti-Plasmodium defense.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      TEP6 belongs to the insect thioester-containing protein family that plays established roles
      in complement-like innate immunity. The UniProt function annotation states it "Binds covalently
      through a thioester bond to the pathogen surface resulting in pathogen clearance." While this
      is inferred from family membership (ARBA annotation), the TEP family's immune function is
      well-documented. TEP1 has been extensively characterized as a key effector in anti-Plasmodium
      immunity. Evolutionary analysis shows TEP6 shares regions with TEP1 through gene conversion,
      supporting functional relatedness.

    label: endopeptidase inhibitor activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is an over-annotation based on the presence of alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M)
      domains (InterPro:IPR001599, IPR002890). While vertebrate alpha-2-macroglobulins are indeed
      protease inhibitors that trap and inactivate proteases, insect thioester-containing proteins
      (TEPs) have evolved a fundamentally different function. Insect TEPs are complement-like
      opsonins that function by covalently tagging pathogen surfaces via their reactive thioester
      domain, promoting phagocytosis and melanization - NOT by inhibiting proteases. The bait region
      domain is present but its function in insect TEPs is unclear and likely not related to
      protease trapping.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The InterPro2GO mapping from A2M domains to endopeptidase inhibitor activity is inappropriate
      for insect TEPs. This represents a classic case of over-annotation based on domain homology
      without considering functional divergence. Key evidence against protease inhibitor function:
      (1) Insect TEPs function as complement-like opsonins, not protease inhibitors.
      (2) TEP1 (the best-characterized family member) binds to pathogen surfaces via thioester
      bonds and promotes killing through melanization, not through protease inhibition.
      (3) The UniProt function annotation states the protein "Binds covalently through a thioester
      bond to the pathogen surface resulting in pathogen clearance" - describing opsonization, not
      protease inhibition. (4) The LRIM1/APL1C-TEP axis in Anopheles is established as a
      complement-like pathway. No literature supports protease inhibitor activity for any insect TEP.

  review:
    summary: >-
      TEP6 is predicted to be secreted based on its domain architecture and family membership.
      The UniProt annotation indicates "Secreted" subcellular location. TEP proteins are secreted
      into the hemolymph where they circulate and function in immunity. This is well-established
      for TEP1 which is expressed in the fat body and secreted to hemolymph.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      TEP proteins are secreted complement-like factors that circulate in the hemolymph. The
      presence of a predicted signal peptide and the established secretion of related family
      members supports this localization. UniProt confirms secreted status for this protein.

  review:
    summary: >-
      TEP6 is predicted to localize to the extracellular space (hemolymph) based on family
      membership and the established localization of TEP1. The thioester-containing domain
      (IPR011626) is associated with secreted proteins. TEP proteins circulate in the hemolymph
      as part of the complement-like immune system.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is consistent with TEP family biology. TEP1 circulates in hemolymph and forms
      complexes with LRIM1/APL1C that stabilize the protein and regulate its activation.
      The extracellular space annotation is appropriate and more specific than the broader
      "extracellular region" term.

  review:
    summary: >-
      TEP6 is a member of the thioester-containing protein family that functions in
      complement-like innate immunity. TEP1, the best-characterized family member, is
      a key effector of innate immunity against Plasmodium parasites. TEP6 shares conserved
      domain architecture and evolutionary relationships with TEP1, supporting an innate
      immune function.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This annotation is more specific than the existing "immune system process" and better
      reflects the established function of the TEP family in insect innate immunity. TEPs
      are germline-encoded pathogen recognition molecules that function in the innate
      (not adaptive) immune response. Evidence is inferred from sequence similarity to
      well-characterized TEP1.

  original_reference_id: file:ANOGA/TEP6/TEP6-deep-research-falcon.md
  review:
    summary: >-
      TEP6 is predicted to bind exogenous (pathogen) proteins based on its thioester-containing
      domain (TED) which enables covalent attachment to pathogen surfaces. This is the core
      molecular function of the TEP family - binding to pathogen surface molecules to tag them
      for clearance.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This molecular function term captures the core activity of TEP proteins - binding to
      pathogen-derived molecules. The TED domain forms covalent thioester bonds with pathogen
      surface proteins, enabling opsonization. This is more informative than "protein binding"
      and accurately reflects the biological context of TEP function.
