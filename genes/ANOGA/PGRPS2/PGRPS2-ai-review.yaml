description: >-
  PGRPS2 is a short, secreted peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) in Anopheles gambiae.
  It is one of three short PGRPs (S1, S2, S3) in this mosquito species, with PGRPS2 and PGRPS3
  being highly similar tandem genes. Unlike PGRPS1, which lacks catalytic residues, PGRPS2
  retains the conserved zinc-binding residues (His-His-Tyr-Cys motif) characteristic of
  catalytic PGRPs, suggesting it functions as a Zn2+-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine
  amidase. As a secreted protein with a signal peptide, PGRPS2 likely functions in the
  hemolymph and extracellular space to modulate peptidoglycan levels, potentially tuning
  IMD pathway activation and antibacterial defense. Population genetic analysis shows PGRPS2
  is under purifying selection, consistent with functional constraint.

    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on UniProtKB keyword mapping (KW-0391 "Immunity"). PGRPS2 belongs
      to the PGRP family, which are established pattern recognition receptors in innate immunity.
      Short PGRPs in Anopheles gambiae are expressed in immune-relevant tissues and participate
      in antibacterial defense [PMID:20067637]. While the annotation is accurate, it is overly
      broad - a more specific term like "innate immune response" (GO:0045087) or "defense
      response to bacterium" (GO:0042742) would be more informative.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The term "immune system process" is too general. PGRPS2 functions specifically in innate
      immunity through peptidoglycan recognition and processing, modulating antibacterial defense.
      A more specific child term should be used.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on InterPro domain IPR006619 (PGRP domain). Catalytic PGRPs
      are Zn2+-dependent enzymes that coordinate zinc through conserved His-His-Tyr-Cys residues.
      Structural analysis shows that PGRPS2 retains these conserved residues. The main difference
      between amidase and non-catalytic PGRPs is the presence of Zn2+ in only amidase PGRPs,
      which is coordinated by two histidines and one cysteine [PMID:34066955].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      PGRPS2 contains the conserved zinc-binding residues (His-His-Tyr-Cys motif) found in
      all catalytically active PGRPs. This is supported by domain architecture and sequence
      conservation patterns. Zinc binding is integral to the amidase catalytic mechanism.

      This annotation is based on InterPro domains IPR002502 (Amidase_domain), IPR006619 (PGRP
      domain), and IPR036505 (Amidase/PGRP_sf). PGRPS2 belongs to the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine
      amidase 2 family per UniProt. Critically, unlike PGRPS1 which lacks catalytic residues,
      PGRPS2 retains the conserved zinc-binding residues (His-His-Tyr-Cys) required for amidase
      activity [PMID:20067637]. However, direct enzymatic assays for PGRPS2 specifically have
      not been published.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Strong evidence from domain conservation, sequence analysis showing intact zinc-binding
      residues, and evolutionary constraint (purifying selection) supports amidase activity.
      Unlike PGRPS1, PGRPS2 retains all critical catalytic residues.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation follows logically from the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase activity
      annotation. If PGRPS2 functions as an amidase, it would cleave peptidoglycan between
      MurNAc and L-Ala, constituting peptidoglycan catabolism. Catalytic short PGRPs like
      Drosophila PGRP-SC1/2 degrade peptidoglycan to modulate immune signaling [PMID:20067637].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This biological process annotation is the appropriate consequence of the molecular
      function (amidase activity). If PGRPS2 has amidase activity as supported by domain
      conservation and sequence analysis, it would participate in peptidoglycan catabolism.

    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on InterPro domain IPR017331 (Peptidoglycan_recognition). All
      PGRPs, whether catalytic or non-catalytic, bind peptidoglycan through their conserved
      PGRP domain. The PGRP domain structure comprises three alpha-helices and a central
      beta-sheet and contains the peptidoglycan-binding groove [PMID:34066955]. PGRPS2 contains
      this domain and would bind peptidoglycan as a prerequisite to any catalytic function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Peptidoglycan binding is a defining characteristic of all PGRP family members. PGRPS2
      has a well-defined PGRP domain that is structurally homologous to the peptidoglycan-binding
      domains of characterized family members.

      This annotation is derived from combined automated annotation using InterPro domain
      IPR017331 and UniProtKB keyword KW-0399 (Innate immunity). PGRPS2 functions as a
      pattern recognition molecule in innate immunity by detecting and processing bacterial
      peptidoglycan. Short secreted PGRPs contribute to extracellular PGN processing that
      shapes IMD pathway activation and antibacterial defense [PMID:20067637]. This is more
      specific and appropriate than GO:0002376.

      PGRPS2 is a short PGRP with a signal peptide (aa 1-20 per UniProt) indicating secretion.
      Short PGRPs are secreted proteins typically found in hemolymph and extracellular spaces
      in insects. In Drosophila, short PGRPs are small extracellular proteins about 200 amino
      acids long present in the hemolymph and cuticle [PMID:20067637].

      The current annotations lack a cellular component term. PGRPS2 has a clear signal
      peptide and belongs to the short (secreted) PGRP class. Its function as an extracellular

  review:
    summary: >-
      Catalytic PGRPs that degrade peptidoglycan serve to dampen immune signaling by reducing
      the pool of activating ligands. By cleaving PGN, amidase PGRPs prevent hyperactivation
      of the IMD pathway. In Drosophila, PGRP-SC1/2 have catalytic activity and can specifically
      control the level of activation of the IMD signalling pathway [PMID:20067637]. Given that
      PGRPS2 is predicted to have amidase activity, it would similarly function to negatively
      regulate PGN-induced immune signaling.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      Based on the conserved amidase activity and the established role of catalytic PGRPs
      as negative regulators of IMD signaling in other insects, this annotation captures
      the likely regulatory function of PGRPS2.
