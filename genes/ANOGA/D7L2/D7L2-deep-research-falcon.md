You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Title: Functional annotation of Anopheles gambiae D7L2 (AngaD7L2; UniProt A0A1S4GYJ6)

Executive summary
D7L2 is a female salivary-gland secreted, long-form member of the D7 family in Anopheles gambiae, distantly related to the odorant-binding protein (PBP/GOBP) superfamily. It functions as a kratagonist that binds host hemostatic and inflammatory mediators, facilitating blood feeding by suppressing vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and local inflammation. Evidence from RNAi knockdown demonstrates D7L2 is required for efficient probing/blood feeding, while human serology indicates strong immunogenicity with utility as an exposure biomarker. Recent 2024 studies highlight regulatory variation and expression changes in D7 genes associated with insecticide resistance contexts.

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: D7L2 (AngaD7L2) is a long-form D7 salivary protein of An. gambiae; D7 proteins are OBP/PBP-related, abundant salivary secreted proteins in blood-feeding Diptera that act as kratagonists of host mediators (biogenic amines and eicosanoids) at the bite site (family/domain context and structural fold) (martinmartin2020adpbindingby pages 1-2, jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 7-9).
- Long vs short D7 forms: Long forms are two-domain proteins with an N-terminal eicosanoid-binding pocket and a C-terminal biogenic-amine pocket (functional diversification within the family) (martinmartin2020adpbindingby pages 1-2, jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 7-9).
- AngaD7L2 role in feeding: Silencing D7L2 increases probing time and reduces blood-feeding success, directly implicating it in counteracting host hemostasis (das2010transcriptomicandfunctional pages 9-11).

2) Molecular function and ligand specificity (current understanding)
- Direct functional evidence in An. gambiae: RNAi of D7L2 causes significant probing time increase (p=0.002), supporting an anti-hemostatic role in vivo (das2010transcriptomicandfunctional pages 9-11).
- Biochemical mechanism inferred from anopheline D7 long forms: Anopheles long-form D7 proteins bind eicosanoids including thromboxane A2 analogs and cysteinyl leukotrienes via a conserved N‑terminal pocket, inhibiting platelet activation and inflammation; structural/functional characterization in anopheline D7s supports this mechanism (jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 7-9, martinmartin2020adpbindingby pages 1-2).
- Comparative specificity from closely related species: Ae. aegypti D7L2 binds the TXA2 analog U‑46619 and modulates vasoconstriction/platelet aggregation; Culex D7 long forms further illustrate family diversity (e.g., ADP-binding), emphasizing species-specific ligand profiles. These data support, but do not overclaim, that AngaD7L2 likely targets eicosanoids/biogenic amines consistent with long-form D7s (martin‐martin2021biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, martinmartin2020adpbindingby pages 1-2, jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 7-9).

3) Structural features and domain architecture
- D7 fold and OBP ancestry: The D7 fold comprises an array of α‑helices stabilized by disulfide bonds, characteristic of OBP-related proteins; structures of An. gambiae D7r4 (short-form) and sand fly long-form D7-like proteins illustrate the conserved architecture and binding pocket topology (jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 7-9).
- Long-form modularity: Long D7s consist of N- and C-terminal domains with distinct ligand pockets; the N-terminal pocket accommodates leukotrienes/TXA2 analogs, while the C-terminal pocket often binds biogenic amines, though some long forms lack amine binding (jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 7-9, martinmartin2020adpbindingby pages 1-2).

4) Localization and secretion
- Tissue specificity: D7 proteins, including D7L2, are abundantly expressed in female salivary glands and secreted into saliva that is injected during probing. D7L2 transcript abundance decreases after blood feeding, consistent with utilization or early downregulation (das2010transcriptomicandfunctional pages 9-11, oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).

5) Physiological/pathway role
- Anti-hemostatic and anti-inflammatory activity: By sequestering host mediators (biogenic amines, leukotrienes/TXA2 analogs), the D7 family inhibits vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation and dampens local inflammation, thereby facilitating blood meal acquisition (martinmartin2020adpbindingby pages 1-2, jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 7-9). RNAi phenotypes of D7L2 in An. gambiae validate this function in vivo (das2010transcriptomicandfunctional pages 9-11).
- Infection context: Long-form D7 is overexpressed in salivary glands of An. gambiae infected with wild Plasmodium falciparum, suggesting parasite-modulated expression and potential to mark infective bites (marie2014anophelesgambiaesalivary pages 7-9).

6) Expression regulation and links to insecticide resistance (recent developments 2023–2024)
- Insecticide resistance association (ortholog evidence): In An. arabiensis from Western Kenya, RNA‑seq revealed overexpression of salivary D7 long/short genes, including D7L1/D7L2, in survivors exposed to pyrethroids and organophosphates, suggesting co-regulation or pleiotropic expression shifts in resistant populations (oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).
- Cis-regulatory variation in An. gambiae: Allele-specific expression analyses identified D7L2 among genes showing ASE in crosses of resistant and susceptible strains, indicating cis‑regulatory elements contribute to D7 expression differences (oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).

7) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Serological biomarkers of exposure: Recombinant D7L2 elicits strong human IgG responses that reflect transmission intensity and are lower among bednet users, supporting use as a quantitative biomarker to monitor human–vector contact and intervention impact (oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).
- Candidate markers of infective bites: Proteomic evidence that long-form D7 is upregulated in P. falciparum–infected salivary glands and the identification of antigenic peptides support development of peptide assays to indicate exposure to potentially infective bites (marie2014anophelesgambiaesalivary pages 7-9).

8) Expert opinions and synthesis from authoritative sources
- Structural/functional consensus: Long-form D7 proteins across Diptera are convergently adapted kratagonists that target eicosanoids and, variably, biogenic amines; conservation of the N‑terminal eicosanoid pocket underpins anti-platelet/anti-inflammatory function, with notable species-specific diversification underscoring the need for species-specific biochemical validation (jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 7-9, martinmartin2020adpbindingby pages 1-2).

9) Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Functional phenotype: D7L2 RNAi knockdown in An. gambiae significantly increased probing time (p=0.002), indicating impaired feeding efficiency (das2010transcriptomicandfunctional pages 9-11).
- Serology: In human cohorts, anti‑D7L2 IgG levels increased with age and were significantly lower in bednet users versus non-users, aligning with differential exposure; responses tracked transmission intensity across sites (oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).

10) Limitations and open questions
- Ligand specificity of AngaD7L2: While long-form D7s in Anopheles bind eicosanoids and some biogenic amines, direct biochemical binding data for AngaD7L2 in An. gambiae remain to be reported; cross-species extrapolation should be treated cautiously given demonstrated diversification in D7 ligand preferences (martinmartin2020adpbindingby pages 1-2, jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 7-9).

11) Verified identity and ambiguity check
- The gene symbol D7L2 matches the UniProt-described long-form salivary protein (AngaD7L2) from Anopheles gambiae and belongs to the OBP/PBP-related D7 family. No conflicting gene with the same symbol in other organisms is cited here; all evidence pertains to anopheline salivary D7 proteins (martinmartin2020adpbindingby pages 1-2, jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 7-9, das2010transcriptomicandfunctional pages 9-11).
