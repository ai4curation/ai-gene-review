description: >-
  D7L2 (AngaD7L2) is a long-form salivary protein from female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes that
  facilitates blood feeding through anticoagulant activity. Unlike the short-form D7 proteins
  (D7r1-r4) which primarily bind biogenic amines, D7L2 functions primarily by targeting the
  intrinsic coagulation pathway - it binds coagulation factors XII (both inactive and activated
  FXIIa) and XI (inactive), preventing generation of activated FXIIa and FXIa. D7L2 also weakly
  binds leukotrienes B4 and D4, though this binding is less pronounced than in the related D7L1
  protein. The protein belongs to the PBP/GOBP structural family but has evolved a distinct
  function unrelated to olfaction.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation correctly describes D7L2's function. The protein modulates host hemostatic
      responses during blood feeding by binding coagulation factors XII and XI and preventing
      their activation, as well as weakly sequestering leukotrienes. This is a valid BP annotation
      for the cross-species effect.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      D7L2 clearly modulates processes in the vertebrate host. Per UniProt, it "Modulates blood
      feeding of female mosquitoes on vertebrate species by binding and sequestering different
      mediators involved in the host response" and "Exhibits anticoagulant activity targeting
      the intrinsic coagulation pathway; binds coagulation factors XII and XI, preventing
      generation of activated FXIIa and FXIa" [UniProt A0A1S4GYJ6]. The GO:0035821 definition
      "A process in which an organism effects a change in a biological process in another organism"
      accurately captures this function. PMID:35460690 demonstrates anticoagulant activity through
      binding host coagulation factors. The annotation was inferred via GO_REF:0000108 from the
      toxin activity annotation, but the underlying logic is sound for this BP term - binding
      host coagulation factors does modulate host hemostatic processes.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is INCORRECT. It is based solely on structural family membership (PBP/GOBP
      family via InterPro IPR006170) but does not reflect the actual function of D7L2. The protein
      binds coagulation factors and weakly binds leukotrienes, not odorants, and has no role in
      olfaction. D7L2 is expressed in salivary glands, not olfactory tissues.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      D7L2 belongs to the PBP/GOBP structural family (InterPro IPR006170), which led to this
      IEA annotation via GO_REF:0000002. However, D7 proteins have evolutionarily repurposed
      this fold for binding host hemostatic/inflammatory mediators in saliva, not odorants in
      antennae. D7L2 is secreted from female salivary glands during blood feeding [UniProt
      A0A1S4GYJ6]. The actual molecular functions involve binding coagulation factors XII and
      XI [PMID:35460690, UniProt A0A1S4GYJ6] and weakly binding leukotrienes B4 and D4
      [PMID:35460690, UniProt A0A1S4GYJ6]. The GO:0005549 definition "Binding to an odorant, any
      substance capable of stimulating the sense of smell" is completely inappropriate - coagulation
      factors and leukotrienes are not odorants. This is a clear case where structural homology
      does not predict function. Deep research on the D7 family confirms long-form D7s "bind
      lipid mediators (cysteinyl leukotrienes; some bind thromboxane A2 analogs) via their
      N-terminal domain" [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md], not odorants.

      This annotation correctly reflects the subcellular localization of D7L2 as a secreted

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      D7L2 is a secreted protein with a signal peptide (residues 1-18) [UniProt A0A1S4GYJ6]. It
      is released into the extracellular space (saliva) during blood feeding. The UniProt entry
      confirms "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted" [UniProt A0A1S4GYJ6]. This is an appropriate CC
      annotation. D7L2 functions at the host bite site, which is an extracellular location. Deep
      research on the D7 family confirms salivary D7 proteins are "produced in adult female
      salivary glands and secreted in saliva at the skin interface during probing/feeding"
      [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is an OVER-ANNOTATION. D7L2 does not meet the GO definition of toxin
      activity, which requires "initiating pathogenesis (leading to an abnormal, generally
      detrimental state)". D7L2 transiently modulates host coagulation by binding coagulation
      factors, but does not cause disease or tissue damage. The weak leukotriene binding also
      does not constitute toxin activity.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      The GO:0090729 definition states: "Interacting selectively with one or more biological
      molecules in another (target) organism, initiating pathogenesis (leading to an abnormal,
      generally detrimental state) in the target organism." D7L2 does NOT meet this definition
      because: (1) It does not initiate pathogenesis - it facilitates feeding, not disease;
      (2) It does not cause tissue damage - it transiently binds coagulation factors and weakly
      sequesters leukotrienes; (3) The effect is reversible and temporary; (4) The host returns
      to normal state after feeding. The UniProt keywords "Blood coagulation cascade inhibiting
      toxin" and "Hemostasis impairing toxin" that led to this IEA annotation via GO_REF:0000043
      are technically inaccurate - anti-hemostatic activity via protein binding is fundamentally
      different from true toxin activity that causes pathological damage. D7L2's mechanism of
      binding coagulation factors XII and XI to prevent their activation [PMID:35460690] is a
      reversible protein-protein interaction, not toxic pathogenesis. Deep research on D7
      proteins explicitly describes the mechanism as kratagonism (scavenging host mediators),
      not toxicity [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

    summary: >-
      D7L2 binds host coagulation factors XII (both inactive and activated FXIIa) and XI
      (inactive). While GO:0005515 is a general term, it accurately describes the molecular
      function. This binding underlies D7L2's anticoagulant activity.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      UniProt confirms D7L2 "Interacts with host coagulation factor XII/F12 (inactive and

      (PubMed:35460690)" [UniProt A0A1S4GYJ6]. While GO:0005515 is a general MF term, it is
      appropriate here because D7L2 binds coagulation factors to prevent their activation -
      this is a protein-protein interaction that underlies the anticoagulant activity. There
      is no more specific GO term for "coagulation factor binding".
