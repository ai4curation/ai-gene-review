description: >-
  D7r2 is a short-form salivary protein from female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes that facilitates
  blood feeding by binding and sequestering host biogenic amines (serotonin, histamine, and
  norepinephrine). It functions as a "kratagonist" - capturing host signaling molecules with high
  affinity to prevent their vasoconstrictive, platelet-aggregating, and inflammatory effects.
  The protein is secreted into saliva during blood feeding. D7r2 belongs to the PBP/GOBP
  (Pheromone/Odorant-Binding Protein) structural family but has evolved a distinct function
  unrelated to olfaction.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation correctly reflects the subcellular localization of D7r2 as a secreted
      salivary protein. The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from the PANTHER
      family including D7r4 (Q7PNF2) which shares the same localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      D7r2 is a secreted protein with a signal peptide (residues 1-21) [UniProt Q9UB31]. It is
      released into the extracellular space (saliva) during blood feeding. The UniProt entry
      confirms "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted" (PMID:17913537) [UniProt Q9UB31]. The IBA
      inference is appropriate as all D7 family members share this secreted localization pattern.
      Deep research on the D7 family confirms "D7r1 is produced in adult female salivary glands
      and secreted in saliva at the skin interface during probing/feeding"
      [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md], which applies equally to D7r2.

# BP: Sensory perception of smell (IBA)

    label: sensory perception of smell
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is INCORRECT. While the IBA inference is based on structural family membership
      (PBP/GOBP-related proteins), D7r2 has no role in olfaction. The protein is expressed exclusively
      in female salivary glands, not olfactory tissues, and functions in blood feeding facilitation,
      not smell perception.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      D7r2 belongs to the PBP/GOBP structural family (InterPro IPR006170), which includes olfactory
      proteins in other contexts. However, the D7 subfamily has evolutionarily repurposed this fold
      for binding biogenic amines in saliva to facilitate blood feeding, not for odorant detection.
      D7r2 is expressed exclusively in adult female salivary glands [PMID:11841502, PMID:9990055],
      not in olfactory tissues. It is not detected in male tissues or in embryo, larval, and pupal
      stages [PMID:11841502]. The UniProt function annotation explicitly states D7r2 "Modulates
      blood feeding of female mosquitoes on vertebrate species by binding and sequestering different
      mediators involved in the host response" [UniProt Q9UB31] - with no mention of olfactory
      function. Deep research confirms short-form D7s "predominantly bind biogenic amines
      (serotonin/5-HT, histamine, epinephrine/norepinephrine)" not odorants
      [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md]. The IBA inference from Drosophila odorant
      binding proteins (FB:FBgn0011279, FB:FBgn0034468, etc.) is inappropriate as the function
      has diverged in mosquito D7 proteins.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on structural family membership (PBP/GOBP family via InterPro
      IPR006170) but does not reflect the actual function of D7r2. The protein binds biogenic
      amines (serotonin, histamine, norepinephrine), not odorants, and has no role in olfaction.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      D7r2 belongs to the PBP/GOBP structural family (InterPro IPR006170), which led to this
      IEA annotation via GO_REF:0000002. However, the D7 proteins have evolutionarily repurposed
      this fold for binding biogenic amines in saliva, not odorants in antennae. D7r2 is expressed
      exclusively in female salivary glands [PMID:11841502, PMID:9990055], not olfactory tissues.
      The actual molecular function is binding serotonin (GO:0051378), histamine (GO:0051381),
      and norepinephrine (GO:0051380). UniProt confirms "Binds serotonin, noradrenaline, histamine
      and adrenaline (PubMed:16301315)" [UniProt Q9UB31]. This is a clear case where structural
      homology does not predict function. The GO:0005549 definition "Binding to an odorant, any
      substance capable of stimulating the sense of smell" does not apply - serotonin, histamine,
      and norepinephrine are not odorants. Deep research confirms D7 short forms "bind serotonin,
      histamine, and catecholamines with high affinity" [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

  review:

      This annotation is appropriate. D7r2 exhibits vasodilating activity by sequestering
      host vasoconstrictors (serotonin, norepinephrine), thereby facilitating blood feeding.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      UniProt explicitly states D7r2 "Exhibits vasodilating activity (PubMed:16301315)" and
      "Inhibits histamine-, serotonin- and noradrenaline-induced smooth muscle contraction
      (PubMed:16301315)" [UniProt Q9UB31]. By sequestering serotonin and norepinephrine (which
      are vasoconstrictors), D7r2 effectively promotes vasodilation at the bite site. This IEA
      annotation inferred from the UniProt keyword "Vasodilator" (KW-0840) via GO_REF:0000043
      is accurate. Deep research confirms D7 kratagonist function "counteracts platelet

      This annotation is acceptable but less informative than the vasodilation annotation.
      D7r2 modulates blood vessel diameter by promoting vasodilation through sequestration
      of vasoconstrictive amines.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      D7r2 affects blood vessel diameter through its vasodilating activity - by sequestering
      serotonin and norepinephrine (vasoconstrictors), it promotes vessel dilation at the bite
      site. This IEA annotation from UniProt keyword "Vasoactive" (KW-0838) via GO_REF:0000043
      is technically correct. However, this is a broader, less informative term than GO:0042311
      (vasodilation), which better captures the specific mechanism. The primary function is
      facilitating blood feeding through kratagonism, not general blood vessel maintenance.
      Keeping as non-core since vasodilation (GO:0042311) is the more appropriate and specific
      annotation.

        Modulates blood feeding of female mosquitoes on vertebrate species by binding and

        four of these five short D7 proteins and the D7 long form bind serotonin with high
        affinity, as well as histamine and norepinephrine

- description: >-
    D7r2 also binds histamine to prevent host inflammatory and pruritic responses during
    blood feeding.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    What are the specific binding affinities (Kd values) of D7r2 for serotonin, histamine,
    and norepinephrine, and how do they compare to D7r1 and other short-form D7 proteins?
  experts:
    - Calvo E
    - Ribeiro JM
    - Andersen JF

- question: >-
    Is there functional redundancy among the D7r1-D7r4 short-form proteins, or do they
    have distinct substrate preferences or tissue localization patterns?
  experts:
    - Calvo E
    - Mans BJ

suggested_experiments:
- hypothesis: >-
    D7r2 knockout mosquitoes will have reduced blood feeding efficiency due to host hemostatic
    and inflammatory responses
  description: >-
    Generate D7r2 knockout A. gambiae using CRISPR and measure blood meal size, feeding time,
    and feeding success rate compared to wild-type controls. Compare to D7r1 knockouts to
    assess redundancy.
  experiment_type: Gene knockout and feeding assay

- hypothesis: >-
    D7r2 has distinct binding site residues compared to D7r4 that confer substrate specificity
  description: >-
    Solve the crystal structure of D7r2 in complex with serotonin, histamine, and norepinephrine
    to identify binding site residues and compare to the published D7r4 structure (Mans et al., 2007)
  experiment_type: Structural biology
