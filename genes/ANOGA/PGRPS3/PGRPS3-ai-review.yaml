description: >-
  PGRP-S3 (AGAP006342) is a short-form peptidoglycan recognition protein in Anopheles gambiae
  that functions as a secreted, zinc-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase. Unlike PGRP-S1
  in this species, PGRP-S3 retains the conserved zinc-binding catalytic residues required for
  amidase activity and is predicted to hydrolyze bacterial peptidoglycan. PGRP-S3 is a tandem
  duplicate of PGRP-S2 on chromosome 2L with approximately 95% sequence identity. As an amidase-type
  PGRP, it likely functions to modulate IMD/REL2 pathway signaling by degrading peptidoglycan
  ligands, thereby negatively regulating innate immune activation and promoting microbiota
  homeostasis in the mosquito midgut.

      PGRP-S3 is a peptidoglycan recognition protein involved in the innate immune system.
      This annotation is derived from UniProtKB keyword mapping (Immunity KW-0391). The
      annotation is correct but very general. More specific immune-related terms such as
      'innate immune response' (GO:0045087) are also annotated and provide more functional
      detail.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Correct but too general. The IEA annotation from keyword mapping is accurate but
      redundant with more specific immune annotations (GO:0045087). Keep as non-core since
      more informative terms are available.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is CORRECT for PGRP-S3. Comparative sequence analyses consistently show
      that PGRP-S3 (along with PGRP-S2) retains the conserved zinc-coordinating residues
      required for N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase activity. This contrasts with PGRP-S1
      in the same species, which lacks these residues and is non-catalytic. The zinc ion
      is essential for the amidase catalytic mechanism.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Well-supported by comparative sequence analysis. Multiple studies confirm that among
      Anopheles short PGRPs, S2 and S3 retain the zinc-coordinating catalytic residues while
      S1 does not. The InterPro-based annotation correctly identifies PGRP-S3 as a zinc-binding
      protein due to its functional amidase domain.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is CORRECT for PGRP-S3. Unlike PGRP-S1 which lacks catalytic residues,
      PGRP-S3 retains the conserved zinc-coordinating and catalytic residues required for
      N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase activity. This enzyme hydrolyzes the lactyl-amide
      bond between MurNAc and L-Ala in bacterial peptidoglycan. PGRP-S3 is classified in
      the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase 2 family and its amidase domain is predicted
      to be catalytically active.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Core molecular function annotation. Multiple comparative analyses confirm PGRP-S3 retains
      the zinc-coordinating catalytic residues characteristic of functional amidases. This
      distinguishes it from the non-catalytic PGRP-S1 in the same organism. The InterPro
      annotation is appropriate for this catalytically active PGRP.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is appropriate for PGRP-S3. As a functional N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine
      amidase that retains catalytic residues, PGRP-S3 is predicted to participate in
      peptidoglycan catabolism by hydrolyzing muropeptides. Amidase-type PGRPs degrade
      bacterial peptidoglycan fragments, thereby modulating the availability of immune-stimulatory
      ligands.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Consistent with the molecular function annotation. Since PGRP-S3 has predicted amidase
      activity (unlike the non-catalytic PGRP-S1), it is expected to participate in peptidoglycan
      catabolism. This process-level annotation appropriately follows from the catalytic
      function.

      PGRP-S3 contains a PGRP domain (IPR017331) that enables binding to bacterial peptidoglycan.
      All PGRPs share this binding function; in the case of catalytic PGRPs like PGRP-S3,
      binding precedes enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct annotation. The PGRP domain mediates peptidoglycan binding in all members of
      this protein family. For amidase-type PGRPs, this binding function is prerequisite
      to the catalytic activity. The IEA annotation from InterPro is appropriate.

      PGRP-S3 functions in the mosquito innate immune system as a modulator of IMD/REL2
      pathway signaling. Amidase-type PGRPs like PGRP-S3 negatively regulate innate immune
      activation by degrading peptidoglycan ligands that would otherwise stimulate the
      IMD pathway. This maintains microbiota homeostasis and prevents immune overactivation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Appropriate biological process annotation. PGRP-S3 is part of the innate immune system
      in mosquitoes, functioning to modulate immune responses by enzymatically degrading
      immunostimulatory peptidoglycan fragments. The IEA annotation accurately reflects
      this role.

  review:
    summary: >-
      PGRP-S3 is a short-form (S-class) PGRP with a signal peptide (residues 1-20), indicating
      secretion. Short PGRPs are characteristically secreted and extracellular, found in
      hemolymph, cuticle, and gut lumen. The signal peptide prediction from SignalP and
      the classification as an S-class PGRP both support extracellular localization.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This cellular component annotation should be added. PGRP-S3 has a predicted signal
      peptide and belongs to the secreted short-form class of PGRPs. Short PGRPs are
      characteristically extracellular, functioning in hemolymph and gut lumen. This is
      consistent with its role as a secreted amidase that modulates extracellular
      peptidoglycan availability.
