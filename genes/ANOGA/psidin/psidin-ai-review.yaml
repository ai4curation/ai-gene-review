description: >-
  Psidin is the auxiliary (non-catalytic) subunit of the NatB N-terminal acetyltransferase complex,
  orthologous to NAA25/MDM20 in other eukaryotes. The core molecular function of psidin is to scaffold
  the catalytic subunit NAA20 and position the NatB complex at ribosomes for co-translational
  N-terminal acetylation of nascent proteins with Met-[Asp/Glu/Asn/Met] N-termini. The gene was
  originally named "phagocyte signaling-impaired protein" based on Drosophila phenotypic studies
  showing immune defects (Brennan et al. 2007), but these represent downstream consequences of
  NatB function in hemocytes rather than the primary molecular role. In Drosophila, psidin also
  has a separable NatB-independent role in actin regulation via Tropomyosin antagonism, affecting
  cytoskeleton organization and neuronal axon targeting (Stephan et al. 2012).

  review:
    summary: >-
      Psidin localizes to the cytoplasm as part of the NatB complex, which is ribosome-associated
      for co-translational activity. This is consistent with the conserved function of NAA25/MDM20
      orthologs across eukaryotes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The cytoplasmic localization is well-supported by phylogenetic inference (IBA) and consistent
      with the NatB complex function. NatB functions at ribosomes in the cytoplasm for co-translational
      N-terminal acetylation. Studies in C. elegans show NATC-1::GFP (related NatC subunit) localizes
      to cytoplasm [PMID:25330323 "NATC-1::GFP was detected in a wide range of cells and tissues in a
      pattern that suggests cytoplasmic localization"]. The ribosome-proximal localization is conserved
      [deep research: "NAA25/MDM20 positions NatB on ribosomes for co-translational substrate access"].

  review:
    summary: >-
      In Drosophila, psidin has a NatB-independent role in actin regulation, affecting growth cone
      lamellipodia and axon targeting by antagonizing Tropomyosin (Tm1). This cytoskeletal function
      is mechanistically separable from NatB complex activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation captures a real, experimentally demonstrated function from Drosophila psidin
      ortholog studies. Stephan et al. 2012 showed that "Psidin independently regulates growth-cone
      lamellipodia and axon targeting by antagonizing Tropomyosin and modulating actin dynamics;
      this role is separable from NatB binding" [deep research citing Stephan 2012]. The IBA annotation
      is appropriate as this function appears conserved in insects. While this is likely a secondary
      (non-core NatB) function, it represents a legitimate biological process annotation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      As the auxiliary subunit of NatB, psidin scaffolds and activates the catalytic subunit NAA20
      for N-terminal acetyltransferase activity. This is the core molecular function of the protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This accurately captures the core molecular function of psidin. The deep research confirms
      "NatB is composed of a catalytic subunit NAA20 (Nat3) and an auxiliary subunit NAA25 (MDM20/psidin)
      that together mediate NatB activity" and "psidin encodes the auxiliary subunit of the NatB
      N-terminal acetyltransferase complex that scaffolds the catalytic subunit NAA20 and positions
      NatB on ribosomes" [citing Stephan 2012, Guedes 2024]. The term GO:0010698 "acetyltransferase
      activator activity" precisely describes the non-catalytic role of enabling/activating the
      acetyltransferase activity of the NAA20 partner.

      This is the primary identity annotation for psidin. The UniProt record explicitly states

      confirms "psidin encodes the conserved NatB auxiliary subunit NAA25/MDM20" with the
      NAA25_NatB_aux_su domain (IPR019183). The GO term definition matches: "A conserved complex
      that catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group to the N-terminal residue of a protein acceptor
      molecule that has a Met-Glu, Met-Asp, Met-Asn, or Met-Met N-terminus." This is a core

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from UniProt keyword mapping based on the protein name "Phagocyte
      signaling-impaired protein" and associated immunity keywords. However, immune functions
      are downstream phenotypic consequences in specific cell types (hemocytes), not the primary
      molecular role of the NatB complex.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      This annotation reflects the historical naming based on Drosophila phenotypic studies (Brennan
      et al. 2007) rather than the core molecular function. The UniProt keywords (KW-0391 Immunity)
      were assigned based on phenotypic observations, but the deep research clarifies that "psidin
      is required for hemocyte phagocytic degradation and systemic immune activation" as a downstream
      consequence of NatB function, not as the primary role. The core function is N-terminal
      acetyltransferase complex activity. While not entirely incorrect (there are legitimate immune
      phenotypes in Drosophila), this is too broad and misleading as a function annotation for what
      is fundamentally a NatB complex subunit.

      Lysosomal localization was reported in Drosophila hemocytes specifically, where psidin was

      has also been reported in hemocytes with lysosomal associations during phagocytic degradation,
      suggesting potential cell-type-specific localizations in insects" [citing Brennan 2007]. This
      represents a cell-type-specific localization in hemocytes rather than the general localization
      of the protein. The primary localization is cytoplasmic/ribosome-associated. Keeping as
      non-core reflects that this is a real but specialized localization.

      psidin mutants show innate immunity defects in hemocytes [deep research: "psidin also supports
      hemocyte phagocytic degradation and systemic immune activation"], this reflects cell-type-specific
      phenotypic consequences of losing NatB function. The protein is not itself an immune signaling
      component but rather a general NatB complex subunit whose loss affects multiple cellular
      processes including, in hemocytes, immune functions. Marking as over-annotated rather than
      removing because there is genuine experimental basis in Drosophila.

      The same reasoning applies as for the IEA lysosome annotation - this is cell-type
      specific (hemocyte blood cells) and secondary to the primary cytoplasmic localization.
      Keeping as non-core acknowledges the experimental basis while recognizing it is not
      the general localization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from Drosophila studies where psidin mutants showed defects in
      phagocytic degradation of bacteria in hemocytes. The phenotype is real but represents
      a cell-type-specific consequence of NatB function.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      The deep research notes "psidin is expressed in hemocytes and was reported as a lysosomal
      protein required for phagocytic degradation and for activating systemic immune responses"
      [citing Brennan 2007]. However, this reflects the consequences of losing NatB-mediated
      N-terminal acetylation in hemocytes, not a direct role in phagocytosis. The protein does
      not directly participate in phagocytic engulfment machinery. Psidin/NAA25 is a general
      NatB complex subunit present in all cell types; phagocytosis defects are one manifestation
      of NatB loss in immune cells. This is over-annotation that conflates phenotype with function.

      Similar to other immune annotations, this derives from Drosophila phenotypic studies

      component.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      The ISS annotation transfers from Drosophila ortholog studies showing immune phenotypes.
      The UniProt function states psidin "Has 2 roles in the larval immune response: required
      both for the phagocytic degradation of internalized bacteria and for the induction of
      Defensin in the fat body." However, these are phenotypic consequences of losing NatB
      complex function in specific tissues, not the molecular function. The NatB complex
      acetylates many proteins globally; immune cells happen to depend on this for proper
      function. This annotation is misleading because it implies psidin is an immune-specific
      gene when it is actually a fundamental N-terminal acetyltransferase complex subunit.

    summary: >-
      As the auxiliary subunit of NatB, psidin enables co-translational N-terminal acetylation

      is missing from the current GOA file but should be a core annotation.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This is a core biological process that should be annotated. The deep research clearly
      establishes that "NatB catalyzes co-translational N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation)
      of nascent polypeptides, in particular N-termini beginning with Met-Asp or Met-Glu" and
      psidin is the essential auxiliary subunit. GO:0006474 "N-terminal protein amino acid
      acetylation" is the appropriate biological process term. This annotation would be more
      informative than the phenotypic immune annotations currently present.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    Has psidin function been directly studied in Anopheles gambiae, or are all functional
    inferences from Drosophila ortholog studies? Current annotations rely heavily on
    Drosophila studies. Direct experimental evidence in mosquito would strengthen annotations.
- question: >-
    Is the NatB-independent actin regulatory function of Drosophila psidin conserved in
    Anopheles psidin? Stephan et al. 2012 showed Drosophila psidin has separable NatB-dependent
    and NatB-independent functions. Conservation in mosquitoes is unknown.

suggested_experiments:
- description: >-
    RNAi knockdown of psidin in Anopheles cells or larvae to assess effects on
    N-terminal acetylation and immune phenotypes. This would validate ortholog-based
    functional annotations directly in Anopheles.
  hypothesis: Psidin knockdown will impair N-terminal acetylation and cause immune defects similar to Drosophila
- description: >-
    Co-immunoprecipitation of psidin with NAA20 ortholog in Anopheles to confirm
    NatB complex formation. This would directly demonstrate NatB complex assembly in mosquito.
  hypothesis: Psidin physically interacts with NAA20 in Anopheles as part of the NatB complex
