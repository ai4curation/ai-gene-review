## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q7PYI4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Phagocyte signaling-impaired protein; AltName: Full=N-terminal acetyltransferase B complex subunit MDM20 homolog; AltName: Full=N-terminal acetyltransferase B complex subunit NAA25 homolog;
- **Gene Information:** Name=psidin {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9VDQ7}; ORFNames=AGAP001954;
- **Organism (full):** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the MDM20/NAA25 family. .
- **Key Domains:** NAA25_NatB_aux_su. (IPR019183); TPR-like_helical_dom_sf. (IPR011990); NatB_MDM20 (PF09797)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "psidin" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'psidin' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **psidin** (gene ID: psidin, UniProt: Q7PYI4) in ANOGA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan
- Verified identity: psidin (AGAP001954) encodes the Anopheles gambiae ortholog of the NatB auxiliary subunit NAA25/MDM20 (UniProt Q7PYI4), with TPR-like and NatB_MDM20 domains matching the MDM20/NAA25 family (see Verification). Proceeded to synthesize orthology-based functional annotation from Drosophila and mammalian NatB literature, prioritizing 2023–2024 sources for mechanism and pathway context. (stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 7-8, guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21)

Verification of target identity (mandatory checks)
- Gene/protein symbol and description: The target is psidin (AGAP001954) in Anopheles gambiae; UniProt Q7PYI4 annotates it as “Phagocyte signaling-impaired protein,” with aliases indicating homology to NAA25/MDM20, the auxiliary subunit of NatB. Domain architecture includes NAA25_NatB_aux_su and TPR-like helical repeats, consistent with NatB auxiliary subunits (see also Drosophila ortholog “Psidin”) (Nov 2012; https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3116-12.2012) (stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 7-8).
- Organism: Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito) per UniProt/Q7PYI4; Drosophila psidin evidence is used strictly as orthology support and not conflated with other species’ genes (stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 7-8).
- Family/domains: Matches MDM20/NAA25 family and NatB_MDM20 domain, aligning with NatB auxiliary subunits that scaffold the catalytic subunit NAA20 and position the complex at ribosomes (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21).
- Ambiguity: No conflicting gene usage in Anopheles detected; “psidin” in insects refers to the NAA25/MDM20 ortholog; proceed.

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Core function: psidin encodes the auxiliary subunit of the NatB N-terminal acetyltransferase complex. NatB catalyzes co-translational N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation) of nascent polypeptides, in particular N-termini beginning with Met-Asp, Met-Glu, Met-Asn, or Met-Gln (Met-[D/E/N/Q]) following initiator Met retention. The catalytic activity resides in NAA20 (Nat3), whereas NAA25 (psidin/MDM20) scaffolds and positions the complex for co-translational activity (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21). In Drosophila, Psidin physically binds dNAA20 and functions as the noncatalytic NatB subunit (Nov 2012; https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3116-12.2012) (stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 1-3, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 10-12, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 9-10).
- Substrate class and pathway: NatB targets a defined substrate class (Met-[D/E/N/Q] N-termini) and performs Nt-acetylation co-translationally at the ribosome exit tunnel, a modification implicated in protein stability, folding, complex assembly, and regulated proteolysis crosstalk with the Arg/N-degron pathway (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21).
- Additional, species-specific roles: Drosophila Psidin also exerts a NatB-independent role in growth cones as an actin regulator antagonizing Tropomyosin (Tm1), influencing lamellipodial dynamics and axon targeting; these functions are mechanistically separable from its NatB-binding role (Nov 2012; https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3116-12.2012) (stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 12-14, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 14-14, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 7-8).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- NatB in cell-cycle and DNA replication: Depletion/inactivation of the catalytic subunit NAA20 disrupts DNA replication initiation, reduces cell-cycle progression, and induces senescence in mammalian cells, underscoring NatB’s importance for proteome stability and replication factors (May 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24108724). Integrated 2024 work reinforces NatB’s broad roles in proteostasis and signaling (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21).
- NatB–apoptosis crosstalk via Arg/N-degron pathway: 2024 mechanistic work showed that NatB-mediated Nt-acetylation protects procaspase-8 from UBR4/UBR1 Arg/N-recognin–mediated degradation, and is required for full induction of extrinsic apoptosis, clarifying how NatB interfaces with protein quality control and death signaling (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21).
- Ribosome-proximal mechanism: Recent reviews and primary data emphasize that NAA25/MDM20 positions NatB on ribosomes for co-translational substrate access, consistent with conserved ribosome association originally characterized in yeast and extended to metazoans (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Proteome annotation and N-terminomics in eukaryotes: Knowledge of NatB substrate rules (Met-[D/E/N/Q]) informs N-terminomics pipeline design and proteome annotation, aiding prediction of Nt-acetylation states for thousands of proteins including mosquito proteins orthologous to known NatB substrates (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21).
- Functional genomics and vector biology: Orthology-based annotation supports hypothesis-driven experiments in Anopheles: e.g., testing psidin/NAA25 genetic perturbation for effects on hemocyte function (phagocytosis) or neurodevelopmental processes critical for behavior, extrapolating from Drosophila phenotypes while recognizing species differences (Nov 2012; https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3116-12.2012) (stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 7-8, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 1-3, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 14-15). In mammals, NatB’s roles in DNA replication and apoptosis are being leveraged as potential therapeutic entry points in oncology and cell senescence research, illustrating translational relevance of NatB pathway modulation (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Authoritative mechanistic view: Contemporary mechanistic studies consolidate the model that NAA25 (psidin/MDM20) is essential for ribosome anchoring and functional integrity of NatB, ensuring timely co-translational acetylation of its substrate class. This positioning is central to how NatB influences proteostasis, cell-cycle progression, and apoptosis via crosstalk with N-degron–mediated degradation (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21).
- Orthologous inference for Anopheles: Given the strict conservation of NatB subunit composition and substrate rules from yeast to metazoans, it is parsimonious to annotate An. gambiae psidin (Q7PYI4) as the NAA25 ortholog that scaffolds NAA20 for co-translational acetylation of Met-[D/E/N/Q] substrates. Drosophila data add that psidin can harbor additional, cell-type–specific roles, notably an actin-regulatory function independent of NatB, which may or may not be conserved in mosquitoes (Nov 2012; https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3116-12.2012) (stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 1-3, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 12-14, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 14-14).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Substrate class coverage: NatB collectively acetylates a substantial fraction of eukaryotic proteins with Met-[D/E/N/Q] N-termini; ribosome-association supports co-translational modification of this class (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21). In Drosophila neuronal development, genetic epistasis separates Psidin’s NatB-dependent role (neuronal survival) from its actin-regulatory role (axon targeting), with cell loss prevented by caspase inhibition and targeting defects modulated by Tropomyosin and actin regulators (Nov 2012; https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3116-12.2012) (stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 7-8, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 9-10, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 12-14).
- 2023–2024 mechanistic endpoints: NAA20 depletion reduces DNA replication initiation and induces senescence in MEFs, linking NatB to cell-cycle fidelity; NatB deletion reduces responsiveness to extrinsic apoptotic stimuli via destabilization of procaspase-8, partially rescued by UBR4 knockdown (May 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24108724; Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21).

Functional annotation for Anopheles gambiae psidin (Q7PYI4)
- Primary biochemical role: Noncatalytic auxiliary subunit of the NatB N-terminal acetyltransferase complex that scaffolds the catalytic subunit NAA20 and positions NatB on ribosomes to cotranslationally acetylate nascent proteins with Met-[D/E/N/Q] N-termini (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21).
- Cellular localization: Predominantly cytosolic and ribosome-associated as part of NatB; in Drosophila, psidin has also been reported in hemocytes with lysosomal associations during phagocytic degradation, suggesting potential cell-type–specific localizations in insects (Nov 2012; https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3116-12.2012) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 14-15, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 7-8).
- Pathways: Co-translational N-terminal acetylation pathway (NatB), intersecting with proteostasis and the Arg/N-degron pathway; ortholog-based inference suggests roles in cellular processes that depend on NatB substrates, including cytoskeleton regulation and potentially cell-cycle fidelity (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2024.2382453) (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21).
- Inferred phenotypes/biology (from orthologs): In Drosophila, psidin is required for olfactory receptor neuron survival (NatB-dependent) and for proper axon targeting via an actin/Tropomyosin mechanism (NatB-independent). psidin also supports hemocyte phagocytic degradation and systemic immune activation. These phenotypes guide hypotheses for mosquito biology but require direct validation in Anopheles (Nov 2012; https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3116-12.2012) (stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 1-3, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 10-12, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 14-15, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 12-14, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 14-14, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 7-8).

Notes on evidence scope and limitations
- Direct Anopheles experimental literature for psidin (AGAP001954) is limited. Therefore, we prioritized conserved mechanistic literature on NatB (with 2023–2024 primary studies) and detailed Drosophila psidin genetics and cell biology to infer function, taking care to distinguish inference from direct evidence (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 1-3).

Conclusion
Anopheles gambiae psidin (Q7PYI4; AGAP001954) encodes the conserved NatB auxiliary subunit NAA25/MDM20. By scaffolding NAA20 at ribosomes, psidin enables co-translational Nt-acetylation of Met-[D/E/N/Q] substrates, a modification that modulates protein stability, folding, and turnover and interfaces with the Arg/N-degron pathway. Recent 2023–2024 studies refine NatB’s roles in DNA replication, cell-cycle progression, and extrinsic apoptosis via protection of procaspase-8 from UBR4-mediated degradation, underscoring the pathway’s physiological reach. Drosophila ortholog evidence adds a NatB-independent actin-regulatory role for psidin in neuronal wiring and a role in hemocyte lysosomal function during phagocytosis. Together, these data provide a functional framework for psidin in mosquitoes: a core role in NatB-mediated co-translational acetylation with potential cell-type–specific functions in immunity and neurodevelopment that merit direct experimental validation in Anopheles (guedes2024natbprotectsprocaspase8 pages 17-21, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 1-3, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 10-12, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 14-15, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 9-10, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 12-14, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 14-14, stephan2012drosophilapsidinregulates pages 7-8).
