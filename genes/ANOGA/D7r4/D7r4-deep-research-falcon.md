### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q7PNF2
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Short form salivary protein D7R4 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=D7-related 4 protein {ECO:0000312|EMBL:AAK84945.1}; AltName: Full=D7r4 protein {ECO:0000312|EMBL:CAC35524.1}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=D7r4 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:16301315}; ORFNames=AgaP_AGAP008281 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:EAA12291.2};
- **Organism (full):** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the PBP/GOBP family. .
- **Key Domains:** PBP/GOBP. (IPR006170); PBP_GOBP_sf. (IPR036728); PBP_GOBP (PF01395)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "D7r4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'D7r4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **D7r4** (gene ID: D7r4, UniProt: Q7PNF2) in ANOGA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Research report: D7r4 (AGAP008281; UniProt Q7PNF2) from Anopheles gambiae

Verification of identity and context
- Gene/protein identity: D7r4 is one of four short-form D7-related salivary proteins (D7r1–r4) encoded in a genomic cluster on chromosome arm 3R in Anopheles gambiae; these proteins are abundantly expressed in adult female salivary glands and secreted during blood feeding (Arcà et al., Insect Molecular Biology, Feb 2002; https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0962-1075.2001.00309.x) (arca2002aclusterof pages 1-2). The protein was structurally and functionally characterized as a biogenic amine–binding D7 short form from A. gambiae (Mans et al., J. Biol. Chem., Dec 2007; online Oct 9, 2007; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M706410200) (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1, mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 8-9).
- Organism: African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae; D7 family members are female-salivary proteins injected into host skin (Arcà 2002; https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0962-1075.2001.00309.x) (arca2002aclusterof pages 1-2). Serological profiling of A. gambiae D7 proteins, including D7r4, confirmed immunogenicity in exposed humans (Oseno et al., Parasites & Vectors, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-05130-5) (oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).
- Family/domains: D7 proteins are OBP-like helical proteins related to insect pheromone/odorant-binding proteins (PBP/GOBP); short forms (like D7r4) are single-domain, all-α-helical proteins stabilized by conserved disulfides (Andersen, Toxicon, Dec 2010; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2009.11.002) (andersen2010structureandmechanism pages 8-9).

Key concepts and definitions
- D7 family: Highly expressed salivary proteins of blood-feeding mosquitoes that bind and sequester host small-molecule mediators of hemostasis and inflammation (biogenic amines, eicosanoids), mitigating vasoconstriction, platelet activation, and inflammation at the bite site (Andersen 2010; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2009.11.002) (andersen2010structureandmechanism pages 8-9).
- Short-form D7s: Single-domain OBP-like proteins typified by D7r4 in A. gambiae that bind biogenic amines (Mans et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2007; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M706410200) (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1, mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 8-9).

Functional annotation of D7r4
- Biochemical function and ligand specificity: Recombinant and crystallographic analyses established that D7r4 binds biogenic amines, including serotonin, norepinephrine, histamine, and tryptamine, consistent with a role in scavenging vasoactive and pro-inflammatory amines during feeding (Mans et al., J. Biol. Chem., Dec 2007; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M706410200) (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1, mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 8-9). Structural interpretation indicates hydrogen bonding between the protonated amine and acidic residues (e.g., Asp/Glu) and packing of the aromatic ring in a hydrophobic pocket; histamine binds with somewhat lower affinity than serotonin/catecholamines (Andersen, Toxicon, Dec 2010; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2009.11.002) (andersen2010structureandmechanism pages 8-9).
- Mechanistic role in pathways: By sequestering biogenic amines, D7r4 is inferred to dampen vasoconstriction (e.g., norepinephrine), itch/inflammation (e.g., histamine), and platelet activation (e.g., serotonin), thereby facilitating blood meal acquisition at the skin interface (Mans 2007; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M706410200; Andersen 2010; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2009.11.002) (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1, andersen2010structureandmechanism pages 8-9).

Structure and domain organization
- Structural data: The crystal structure of A. gambiae D7r4 was solved in unliganded and ligand-bound forms, revealing an OBP-like fold comprising approximately eight α-helices with three disulfide bonds. Ligand-bound structures define a pocket accommodating biogenic amines with specific polar contacts and aromatic stacking (Mans et al., J. Biol. Chem., Dec 2007; PDB coordinates referenced therein; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M706410200) (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 8-9, mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1). Review synthesis corroborates this architecture and ligand-contact network (Andersen 2010; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2009.11.002) (andersen2010structureandmechanism pages 8-9).

Localization and site of action
- Tissue/cellular localization: D7r4 is part of a salivary gland–expressed gene cluster; proteins are secreted into saliva and delivered to host skin during probing/feeding by adult females (Arcà 2002; https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0962-1075.2001.00309.x) (arca2002aclusterof pages 1-2). Human serologic evidence confirms exposure to D7 family antigens, including D7r4, at field sites with different transmission intensities (Oseno 2022; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-05130-5) (oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).

Quantitative data and statistics
- Binding and kinetics: The primary structural papers characterize D7r4 as high-affinity for several biogenic amines; relative binding preferences indicate stronger binding to serotonin and norepinephrine than to histamine in structural and mutational context (qualitative trend). Exact Kd values are not specified in the excerpts used here and should be taken from the original measurements in Mans et al. 2007 (https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M706410200) (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1, andersen2010structureandmechanism pages 8-9).
- Serology/exposure gradients: In a 2022 cohort study comparing malaria-naive Europeans, moderate-transmission (Junju, Kenya), and high-transmission (Kitgum, Uganda) settings, IgG responses to several A. gambiae D7 antigens, including D7r4, were strongest in the high-transmission area and lowest in malaria-naive individuals, supporting utility of D7 proteins as exposure biomarkers (Oseno 2022; Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-05130-5) (oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (with priority to recent sources)
- Biomarker applications: D7 proteins, including D7r4 among the panel tested, continue to be evaluated as serological markers of vector exposure, with field data indicating exposure-dependent IgG profiles and potential for monitoring intervention impact (Oseno 2022; Parasites & Vectors; Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-05130-5) (oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).
- Comparative structural/functional insights: Cross-lineage comparisons emphasize conserved OBP-like scaffolds and the diversification of ligand pockets across D7 family members, with short-form proteins in mosquitoes primarily adopting biogenic amine binding, while long forms can target eicosanoids (Jablonka et al., Sci. Rep., Mar 2019; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41848-0) (jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 9-10, jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 1-2).
- Note on 2023–2024: We found limited D7r4-specific publications in 2023–2024 within the retrieved evidence set; however, the broader D7 family continues to be the subject of structural/functional and sero-epidemiological studies. Key mechanistic and structural conclusions for D7r4 remain anchored in primary structural work and authoritative reviews cited above (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1, andersen2010structureandmechanism pages 8-9, oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).

Current applications and implementations
- Exposure surveillance: Recombinant D7 salivary proteins, including D7r4, have been deployed in sero-assays to quantify human–vector contact and to evaluate vector control measures; age-related trends and intervention associations (e.g., bednet use) were particularly evident for some D7 antigens (Oseno 2022; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-05130-5) (oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).
- Therapeutic inspiration: Reviews and comparative analyses highlight D7 scaffolds as sources of anti-inflammatory/anti-hemostatic mechanisms (e.g., scavenging vasoactive lipids/amines) that could inspire antiplatelet or anti-inflammatory lead molecules, though this remains exploratory for D7r4 specifically (Andersen 2010; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2009.11.002; Jablonka 2019; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41848-0) (andersen2010structureandmechanism pages 8-9, jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 9-10, jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Andersen (2010) contextualizes D7 proteins as OBP-like salivary scavengers functionally analogous to lipocalins in other hematophagous lineages, with D7r4 exemplifying biogenic amine binding by short forms; the review integrates structural mechanisms (acidic residues and hydrophobic pockets) with physiological roles in mitigating hemostasis and inflammation (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2009.11.002) (andersen2010structureandmechanism pages 8-9).
- Jablonka et al. (2019) emphasize the evolutionary convergence of D7-mediated eicosanoid/amine scavenging, reinforcing the generality of the mechanism and the specialization of domains across D7 family members (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41848-0) (jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 9-10, jablonka2019functionalandstructural pages 1-2).

Limitations and knowledge gaps
- While D7r4’s biogenic amine-binding role is well-supported structurally and biochemically, quantitative kinetic parameters, precise in vivo concentrations achieved at bite sites, and D7r4-specific functional knockdown phenotypes were not available in the excerpts cited here. Likewise, few D7r4-specific publications from 2023–2024 were retrieved; ongoing D7 family research nonetheless supports the broader mechanistic framework (Mans 2007; Andersen 2010; Oseno 2022) (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1, andersen2010structureandmechanism pages 8-9, oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).

Conclusion
D7r4 (AGAP008281; Q7PNF2) is a secreted, short-form D7 salivary protein of Anopheles gambiae with an OBP-like fold that binds and sequesters biogenic amines, notably serotonin and norepinephrine, reducing vasoconstriction, platelet activation, and inflammatory signaling at the bite site. Its structure, ligand interactions, and inferred physiological role in facilitating blood feeding are supported by crystallography and expert reviews. D7 family antigens, including D7r4, are already used in serological exposure assays, with ongoing research focused on leveraging these proteins for surveillance and as models for anti-hemostatic mechanisms (Mans 2007; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M706410200; Andersen 2010; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2009.11.002; Oseno 2022; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-05130-5) (mans2007thecrystalstructure pages 1-1, andersen2010structureandmechanism pages 8-9, oseno2022characterizationofanopheles pages 1-2).
