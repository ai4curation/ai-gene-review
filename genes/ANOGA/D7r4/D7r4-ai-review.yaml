description: >-
  D7r4 is a short-form salivary protein from female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes that facilitates
  blood feeding by binding and sequestering host biogenic amines (serotonin, histamine, norepinephrine,
  and tryptamine). It functions as a "kratagonist" - capturing host signaling molecules with high
  affinity to prevent their vasoconstrictive and inflammatory effects. The crystal structure of D7r4
  has been solved (PDB: 2PQL, 2QEB, 2QEH, 2QEO, 2QEV) at high resolution (2.0-2.31 Angstroms),
  revealing a modified OBP-like fold with eight alpha-helices, three disulfide bonds, and a binding
  pocket adapted to amine ligands. D7r4 is secreted into saliva during blood feeding and belongs
  to the PBP/GOBP (Pheromone/Odorant-Binding Protein) structural family but has evolved a distinct
  function unrelated to olfaction.

      This annotation correctly describes D7r4's localization based on phylogenetic inference.
      D7r4 is a secreted salivary protein with a signal peptide (residues 1-21) that is released
      into the extracellular space during blood feeding [UniProt Q7PNF2].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      D7r4 is confirmed to be a secreted protein localized to female saliva. UniProt states
      "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted" with evidence from PMID:17913537. The IBA annotation from
      phylogenetic trees is consistent with the IDA evidence for the same term. The protein
      contains a signal peptide and is found in the extracellular salivary compartment from
      which it is injected into the host during blood feeding [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is INCORRECT. D7r4 is expressed exclusively in female salivary glands and
      functions in blood feeding, not in olfactory perception. The IBA annotation was inferred
      from homology to Drosophila odorant-binding proteins, but D7 proteins have evolved a
      completely different function in mosquito saliva.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      D7r4 is expressed specifically in female salivary glands, not olfactory tissues
      [PMID:12062411, PMID:11841502]. UniProt explicitly states the tissue specificity. The D7
      proteins have evolutionarily repurposed the OBP-like fold from olfactory function to
      biogenic amine binding in saliva [PMID:16301315]. The IBA annotation appears to be based
      on structural family membership (PBP/GOBP) shared with Drosophila odorant-binding proteins,
      but this does not predict function. D7r4 binds serotonin, histamine, and norepinephrine -
      not odorants [PMID:17928288]. Deep research confirms short-form D7s "predominantly bind
      biogenic amines" [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on structural family membership (PBP/GOBP family via InterPro
      IPR006170) but does not reflect the actual function of D7r4. The protein binds biogenic
      amines (serotonin, histamine, norepinephrine, tryptamine), not odorants, and has no role
      in olfaction. Crystal structures with bound ligands demonstrate this directly.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      D7r4 belongs to the PBP/GOBP structural family (InterPro IPR006170), which led to this
      IEA annotation. However, the D7 proteins have evolutionarily repurposed this fold for
      binding biogenic amines in saliva, not odorants in antennae. D7r4 is expressed exclusively
      in female salivary glands [PMID:12062411], not olfactory tissues. The actual molecular
      functions are serotonin binding (GO:0051378), histamine binding (GO:0051381), norepinephrine
      binding (GO:0051380), and tryptamine binding. Crystal structures of D7r4 with bound serotonin
      (PDB:2QEH), histamine (PDB:2QEB), norepinephrine (PDB:2QEO), and tryptamine (PDB:2PQL)
      demonstrate the actual binding specificity [PMID:17928288]. UniProt documents specific
      binding residues for each ligand. The GO:0005549 definition "Binding to an odorant, any
      substance capable of stimulating the sense of smell" does not apply - serotonin, histamine,
      norepinephrine, and tryptamine are not odorants. Deep research confirms short-form D7s

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is technically correct but represents the downstream physiological effect
      rather than the direct biological process. D7r4 exhibits vasodilating activity by
      sequestering vasoconstrictors (serotonin, norepinephrine) from the host.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      UniProt confirms D7r4 "Exhibits vasodilating activity" [UniProt Q7PNF2]. The mechanism is
      indirect - D7r4 sequesters serotonin and norepinephrine, which are vasoconstrictors,
      thereby preventing vasoconstriction and allowing vasodilation at the bite site.
      PMID:16301315 states D7 proteins "bind serotonin with high affinity, as well as histamine
      and norepinephrine" and that "Scavenging of host amines would antagonize their
      vasoconstrictor, platelet-aggregating, and pain-inducing properties." While the
      annotation captures a real physiological effect, it is a downstream consequence of
      the kratagonist mechanism. However, since this is documented in the literature, it
      should be retained. Deep research confirms biogenic amine scavenging "counteracts
      platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, and nociception during feeding"
      [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

      This annotation is a parent term of vasodilation and is somewhat redundant. D7r4 affects
      blood vessel diameter by counteracting vasoconstriction through sequestration of host
      biogenic amines.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      This annotation is inferred from the UniProt keyword "Vasodilator" via GO_REF:0000043.
      While technically accurate as a broader term encompassing vasodilation, it is less
      informative than GO:0042311 (vasodilation) which is also annotated. The primary mechanism
      of D7r4 is sequestration of vasoconstrictive amines, with blood vessel diameter
      maintenance being a downstream physiological consequence. This should be kept as a
      non-core annotation since it accurately reflects a real biological effect but is not
      the primary function of the protein.

  title: Deep research review of D7 protein family function and evolution
  findings:
    - statement: D7 proteins function as kratagonists that scavenge host signaling molecules
      supporting_text: >-
        D7 proteins are among the most abundant mosquito salivary proteins and function
        as kratagonists—high-affinity scavengers of host small-molecule inflammatory
        and hemostatic mediators
    - statement: Short-form D7s bind biogenic amines
      supporting_text: >-
        short-form D7s (including D7r1) predominantly bind biogenic amines (serotonin/5-HT,
        histamine, epinephrine/norepinephrine)
    - statement: D7 proteins are secreted in saliva during feeding
      supporting_text: >-
        D7r1 is produced in adult female salivary glands and secreted in saliva at the
        skin interface during probing/feeding
    - statement: Crystal structure of D7r4 reveals binding pocket for biogenic amines
      supporting_text: >-
        The crystal structure of An. gambiae D7r4 revealed a modified OBP-like fold
        (eight alpha-helices, three disulfide bonds) and a binding pocket adapted to
        amine ligands

core_functions:
- description: >-
    D7r4 functions as a kratagonist by binding and sequestering host biogenic amines (serotonin,
    histamine, norepinephrine, and tryptamine) during blood feeding, thereby preventing
    vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and inflammation at the feeding site.
