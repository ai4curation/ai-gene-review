  label: Anopheles gambiae
description: >-
  CLIPB4 is a CLIP domain-containing serine protease that functions as a central upstream node in the
  melanization cascade of Anopheles gambiae. It is secreted into the hemolymph as a zymogen and, upon
  proteolytic activation, cleaves and activates downstream proteases including CLIPB8. CLIPB4 plays a
  key role in the innate immune response against protozoan parasites (Plasmodium) and bacterial pathogens
  by activating the prophenoloxidase (PPO) cascade leading to melanin deposition at pathogen surfaces.
  The protein is regulated by serpins (particularly SRPN2) that rapidly inhibit the active form to
  prevent collateral damage from uncontrolled melanization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      CLIPB4 is secreted into hemolymph as a zymogen and functions in the extracellular space where it
      participates in the melanization cascade. UniProt annotation indicates "Secreted" for subcellular
      location. The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from related CLIP-domain proteases
      in Drosophila and other insects that are established hemolymph proteins.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The extracellular space localization is well-supported. UniProt states "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION:
      Secreted" and the deep research confirms "CLIPB4 is secreted into hemolymph as a zymogen"
      (saab2024insightintothe). The IBA evidence from phylogenetic inference across multiple insect
      species provides strong support for this conserved localization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      CLIPB4 plays a well-documented role in innate immunity through its function in the melanization
      cascade. RNAi knockdown experiments demonstrate reduced melanization after microbial challenge
      and increased Plasmodium infection, establishing a clear immune function. However, a more specific
      term such as "melanization defense response" (GO:0035006) or "positive regulation of melanization
      defense response" (GO:0035008) would better capture the precise function.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While the innate immune response annotation is correct, it is too general for CLIPB4's specific
      role. The protein functions specifically in the melanization arm of innate immunity. UniProt
      states "Serine protease which plays a role in the innate immune response against protozoan and
      bacterial pathogens... by activating the melanization cascade" (PMID:16922859, PMID:37703846).
      The more specific term GO:0035006 (melanization defense response) or GO:0035008 (positive
      regulation of melanization defense response) would be more informative.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This is an IEA annotation based on UniProtKB keyword mapping from the "Immunity" and "Innate
      immunity" keywords. While accurate, this term is extremely broad and adds little information
      beyond what is captured by more specific immune annotations.

    reason: >-
      This is a broad parental term that is technically correct but not very informative. It is
      acceptable to retain as an IEA annotation since it correctly captures the general functional
      category, and more specific annotations (like GO:0045087 innate immune response) provide the
      needed specificity. The IBA annotation for innate immune response is more informative.

  review:
    summary: >-
      CLIPB4 contains a trypsin-like serine protease domain (Peptidase S1) with the canonical
      His-Asp-Ser catalytic triad. Experimental evidence confirms catalytic activity - CLIPB4 cleaves
      CLIPB8 and the cSPH cofactor CLIPA8 in vitro (PMID:37703846). The InterPro-based IEA annotation
      is well-supported by both domain architecture and experimental validation.

      This is the core molecular function of CLIPB4 and is strongly supported. UniProt annotates
      EC=3.4.21.- based on experimental evidence (PMID:37703846). The protein has the complete
      catalytic triad (His153, Asp213, Ser311) and experimentally demonstrated protease activity
      cleaving CLIPB8 and CLIPA8. The term is appropriately specific for the enzymatic activity.

      The extracellular region annotation is correct and supported by the "Secreted" annotation in
      UniProt. While GO:0005615 (extracellular space) is more specific and also annotated, retaining

  review:
    summary: >-
      This broad biological process term indicates involvement in proteolytic processes. CLIPB4 is
      an active serine protease that cleaves specific protein substrates (CLIPB8, CLIPA8) as part
      of the melanization cascade. This is a generic annotation derived from the protease domain.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While broad, this term accurately captures CLIPB4's role in proteolytic processing. The protein
      has demonstrated proteolytic activity against specific substrates in the melanization cascade.
      More specific biological process terms related to melanization would be more informative, but
      this annotation is not incorrect.

      This is a broad parent term for peptidase/protease activity. CLIPB4 is annotated more

      This annotation adds no additional information beyond what the more specific term provides.

      While this is a broad parent term that is largely redundant with the more specific GO:0004252

      This term is a parent of GO:0004252 (serine-type endopeptidase activity) which is also

      This is a very broad molecular function term for enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis reactions.
      Serine proteases are hydrolases, so this is technically accurate but provides minimal functional
      information. More specific terms (GO:0004252) are already annotated.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This high-level term is accurate - serine proteases catalyze peptide bond hydrolysis. However,
      it is extremely broad and the more specific GO:0004252 (serine-type endopeptidase activity)
      provides much more functional information. Retaining the IEA annotation is acceptable as it
      represents standard keyword mapping.

      This is a duplicate annotation of the same GO term (GO:0045087) that is also annotated via

      While this is the same GO term as the IBA annotation, having both IEA and IBA evidence is
      valid in GO annotation. The IEA annotation from keyword mapping and the IBA annotation from
      phylogenetic inference independently support the same functional assignment. As noted above,
      a more specific term like GO:0035006 (melanization defense response) would be more informative.

  review:
    summary: >-
      CLIPB4 is directly involved in the melanization defense response against Plasmodium and
      bacterial pathogens. RNAi knockdown experiments demonstrate reduced melanization of
      P. berghei ookinetes in resistant mosquito strains, and reduced melanin excreta after
      bacterial challenge. This term captures the specific immune function of CLIPB4 better
      than the generic "innate immune response" term.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This annotation is strongly supported by experimental evidence. UniProt describes CLIPB4 as
      playing "a role in the innate immune response... by activating the melanization cascade"
      (PMID:16922859, PMID:37703846). RNAi knockdown reduces melanization of P. berghei ookinetes
      in resistant strains. The deep research confirms "knockdown reduces infection-induced melanin
      excreta" (saab2024insightintothe). This specific term is more appropriate than generic innate
      immune response.
