- **UniProt Accession:** Q7PEV7
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=CLIP domain-containing serine protease B4 {ECO:0000305}; EC=3.4.21.- {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00274, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37703846}; AltName: Full=CLIP domain-containing serine protease 14D {ECO:0000305}; Short=AgSp14D1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:10469250}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CLIPB4 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:EAA45573.1}; Synonyms=SP14D1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:10469250}; ORFNames=AGAP003250 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:EAA45573.1};
- **Organism (full):** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the peptidase S1 family. CLIP subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** CLIP. (IPR022700); CLIP_sf. (IPR038565); Peptidase_S1_PA. (IPR009003); Peptidase_S1_PA_chymotrypsin. (IPR043504); Peptidase_S1A. (IPR001314)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CLIPB4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CLIPB4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CLIPB4** (gene ID: CLIPB4, UniProt: Q7PEV7) in ANOGA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
We verified target identity and gathered recent primary literature and authoritative background to annotate CLIPB4 (AgSp14D1/SP14D1; UniProt Q7PEV7) from Anopheles gambiae, focusing on function, pathways, localization, and 2023–2024 developments. We synthesize applications, expert perspectives, and relevant quantitative findings.

1. Key concepts and definitions
CLIPB4 (gene symbol: CLIPB4; aliases: AgSp14D1/SP14D1; locus AGAP003250) encodes a clip-domain serine protease of the S1A family secreted as a zymogen into hemolymph. The protein has an N‑terminal CLIP domain and a C‑terminal trypsin/chymotrypsin-like catalytic domain harboring the His-Asp-Ser catalytic triad typical of active catalytic CLIPs (cSPs). Upon proteolytic activation between domains, the two fragments remain disulfide-linked. In Anopheles, catalytic CLIPs (families B, C, D) and noncatalytic serine protease homologs (cSPHs; families A, E) form extracellular cascades that regulate immune processes, notably prophenoloxidase (PPO) activation leading to melanization, and interface with complement-like TEP1 pathways; serpins (e.g., SRPN2) irreversibly inhibit active CLIPs to prevent damage (architecture/background for CLIPs; domain definitions) (awada2018functionalandmolecular pages 26-31, awada2018functionalandmoleculara pages 26-31, nakhleh2018theroleof pages 30-36, moussawi2019functionalandmolecular pages 33-38).

2. Function, substrates, and pathway position of CLIPB4
Recent network mapping in An. gambiae positions CLIPB4 as an upstream catalytic node in the melanization cascade. Genetic epistasis and western analyses indicate that downstream of CLIPB4 (and CLIPB17) the cascade bifurcates into two branches converging on CLIPB8 and CLIPB10, with CLIPB4 controlling CLIPB10 processing independently of CLIPB8. In vitro, CLIPB4 cleaves the cSPH cofactor CLIPA8, consistent with regulatory interactions between cSPs and cSPHs in signal amplification. Direct PPO activation is strongest for CLIPB10; CLIPB4 has been suggested to have PAP-like activity based on cross-species assays cleaving Manduca sexta PPO, but in vivo PPO activation is better supported for downstream CLIPBs (CLIPB10; earlier work for CLIPB9/CLIPB8). Collectively, CLIPB4 functions upstream within the prophenoloxidase activation network that drives melanization, under control of cSPH cofactors (SPCLIP1, CLIPA8/CLIPA28) and serpins (notably SRPN2) (saab2024insightintothe pages 14-17, saab2024insightintothe pages 1-4, kamareddine2016theroleof pages 40-45).

3. Localization and activation
CLIPB4 is secreted into hemolymph as a zymogen. In systemic infection models, activation fragments for some downstream CLIPs (e.g., CLIPB10) are detectable in hemolymph; however, CLIPB4 activation products are rarely detected, suggesting that only a small active fraction exists transiently and is rapidly neutralized by serpins or sequestered at pathogen surfaces where localized melanization occurs (saab2024insightintothe pages 14-17).

4. Genetic/functional evidence in vivo
- An. gambiae: RNAi of CLIPB4 reduces infection-induced melanin excreta measured by MelASA following Escherichia coli challenge, supporting a role in melanization effector output rather than bulk bacterial clearance. CLIPB4 is identified among proteases implicated in melanotic tumor formation in SRPN2 knockdown mosquitoes (saab2024insightintothe pages 14-17).
- Cross-species functional support: In Anopheles stephensi, Wolbachia infection upregulates CLIPB4 ortholog transcripts; RNAi silencing of CLIPB4 increases Plasmodium falciparum oocyst intensity and prevalence, indicating that CLIPB4 contributes to anti‑Plasmodium defense modulated by symbionts (April 10, 2024; PLOS Pathogens; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012145) (vandana2024wolbachiainfectionresponsiveimmune pages 11-13, vandana2024wolbachiainfectionresponsiveimmune pages 9-11).

5. Recent developments (2023–2024)
- Structural hierarchy of the melanization cascade: 2024 work proposes CLIPB4 and CLIPB17 as upstream bifurcation points, with branches converging on CLIPB8 and CLIPB10. The study integrates epistasis, biochemical cleavage of cSPHs, and infection-induced melanization readouts to refine the network topology (bioRxiv, posted July 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.13.548954) (saab2024insightintothe pages 14-17, saab2024insightintothe pages 1-4).
- Symbiont-mediated regulation and transmission blocking: 2024 PLOS Pathogens reports that Wolbachia wAlbB upregulates CLIPB4 orthologs and that CLIPB4 knockdown increases P. falciparum infection, linking CLIPB4 to symbiont-enhanced anti‑Plasmodium immunity (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012145; April 10, 2024) (vandana2024wolbachiainfectionresponsiveimmune pages 11-13, vandana2024wolbachiainfectionresponsiveimmune pages 9-11).

6. Current applications and implementations
- Vector control concepts: Given CLIPB4’s upstream role, strategies that enhance CLIPB4 activation or stabilize its activity at pathogen surfaces (e.g., via symbiont engineering or targeted modulation of serpins like SRPN2) could strengthen melanization against Plasmodium, bacteria, and fungi. Wolbachia-based interventions may in part act by upregulating CLIPB4-like factors, contributing to reduced malaria transmission; functional data in An. stephensi support this mechanism (vandana2024wolbachiainfectionresponsiveimmune pages 11-13, vandana2024wolbachiainfectionresponsiveimmune pages 9-11).
- Biomarker potential: Infection-induced melanization readouts (MelASA) respond to CLIPB4 perturbation, suggesting potential for CLIPB4 expression or processing as a hemolymph biomarker of melanization capacity in experimental settings (saab2024insightintothe pages 14-17).

7. Expert perspectives and authoritative background
Contemporary analyses emphasize extensive cSP–cSPH interplay in melanization, with cSPHs (e.g., SPCLIP1, CLIPA8, CLIPA28) acting as central nodes and catalytic CLIPs like CLIPB4 providing signal propagation toward terminal PPO-activating proteases (e.g., CLIPB10). Serpins such as SRPN2 serve as master brakes limiting collateral damage; SRPN2 knockdown unveils the cascade’s capacity for spontaneous melanization and highlights nodes like CLIPB4 in the network (kamareddine2016theroleof pages 40-45, awada2018functionalandmolecular pages 26-31, awada2018functionalandmoleculara pages 26-31).

8. Relevant data and statistics
- Symbiont modulation: Wolbachia-driven upregulation of CLIPB4 orthologs and significant increases in P. falciparum oocyst intensity and prevalence upon CLIPB4 silencing in An. stephensi provide quantitative evidence that CLIPB4-like proteases contribute materially to parasite suppression (exact values reported in figures of Vandana et al., 2024; DOI above) (vandana2024wolbachiainfectionresponsiveimmune pages 11-13, vandana2024wolbachiainfectionresponsiveimmune pages 9-11).
- Melanization output: In An. gambiae, CLIPB4 RNAi reduces MelASA-measured melanotic excreta following E. coli challenge, indicating diminished melanization output; the study also shows limited detectability of CLIPB4 activation fragments in bulk hemolymph (saab2024insightintothe pages 14-17).

9. Verification of target identity and nomenclature
The target matches UniProt Q7PEV7: Anopheles gambiae CLIPB4, also known as AgSp14D1/SP14D1 (historical cloning name), a preproenzyme belonging to the S1A serine protease family (CLIP subfamily) with an N‑terminal CLIP domain and a C‑terminal trypsin-like protease domain. This architecture aligns with the literature on Anopheles CLIPs (awada2018functionalandmolecular pages 26-31, awada2018functionalandmoleculara pages 26-31, nakhleh2018theroleof pages 30-36, moussawi2019functionalandmolecular pages 33-38).

Limitations and open questions
- While CLIPB4 shows PAP-like activity in cross-species in vitro assays, direct in vivo demonstration of CLIPB4 cleaving Anopheles PPO remains to be conclusively shown; current evidence places CLIPB4 upstream of terminal PAPs (e.g., CLIPB10) in the cascade. The full set of physiological substrates and serpin specificities for CLIPB4 in An. gambiae remains to be mapped at biochemical resolution (saab2024insightintothe pages 14-17, saab2024insightintothe pages 1-4).
