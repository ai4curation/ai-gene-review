description: >-
  D7L3 (AngaD7L3) is a long-form salivary D7 protein from Anopheles gambiae that uniquely
  binds serotonin among the A. gambiae D7 long-forms. This is unusual because long-form D7
  proteins typically bind eicosanoids (leukotrienes, thromboxane A2), while biogenic amine
  binding is usually a short-form D7 function. D7L3 binds serotonin with high affinity but
  does not bind other biogenic amines (tryptamine, octopamine, dopamine, adrenaline) or
  eicosanoids (LTC4, LTD4, LTB4, thromboxane A2). By sequestering host serotonin at the bite
  site, D7L3 functions as a kratagonist that inhibits serotonin-induced platelet aggregation
  and vasoconstriction, thereby facilitating blood feeding.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation accurately describes D7L3's function. The protein modulates host hemostatic
      responses during blood feeding by sequestering serotonin, which prevents vasoconstriction
      and platelet aggregation. This is a correct BP annotation for the cross-species effect.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      D7L3 clearly modulates processes in the vertebrate host. The UniProt entry states it
      "Modulates blood feeding of female mosquitoes on vertebrate species by binding and
      sequestering different mediators involved in the host response" [UniProt A0A1S4HE90].
      PMID:35460690 demonstrates that "AngaD7L3 inhibits serotonin-induced platelet aggregation
      and vasoconstriction" - this is direct modulation of host hemostatic processes. The
      GO:0035821 definition "A process in which an organism effects a change in a biological
      process in another organism" accurately captures this kratagonist function.

    label: odorant binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is INCORRECT. D7L3 belongs to the PBP/GOBP structural family (InterPro
      IPR006170) which led to this IEA annotation, but D7 proteins have evolved distinct
      functions unrelated to olfaction. D7L3 binds serotonin, not odorants, and is expressed
      in salivary glands not olfactory tissues.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      D7L3 is a salivary protein that functions as a serotonin kratagonist, not an odorant-binding
      protein. The PBP/GOBP fold has been evolutionarily repurposed in D7 proteins for binding
      biogenic amines and eicosanoids in saliva. D7L3 is expressed in adult female salivary glands
      [UniProt A0A1S4HE90], not olfactory tissues. The actual molecular function is serotonin
      binding (GO:0051378). Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is a neurotransmitter/vasoactive amine,
      not an odorant. PMID:35460690 explicitly shows "AngaD7L3 binds serotonin" via isothermal
      titration calorimetry. This is a clear case where structural family membership does not
      predict function.

      D7L3 is a secreted protein with a signal peptide (residues 1-26) [UniProt A0A1S4HE90].
      It is released into the extracellular space (saliva) during blood feeding. The UniProt

    label: vasodilation
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation requires clarification. D7L3 does exhibit vasodilating activity, but the
      mechanism is indirect - by sequestering serotonin, it prevents serotonin-induced
      vasoconstriction rather than directly causing vasodilation. This is still an accurate
      description of the physiological outcome.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      UniProt confirms "Exhibits vasodilating activity (PubMed:35460690)" [UniProt A0A1S4HE90].
      PMID:35460690 demonstrates that AngaD7L3 is a vasodilator via myography assays, showing
      "A. gambiae salivary D7L1 and D7L3 proteins are vasodilators" with documented LogIC50
      values. The mechanism is kratagonism - by sequestering serotonin, D7L3 prevents serotonin
      from causing vasoconstriction, resulting in relative vasodilation. The functional outcome
      is accurate even if the mechanism is indirect.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is an OVER-ANNOTATION. D7L3 does not meet the GO definition of toxin
      activity, which requires "initiating pathogenesis (leading to an abnormal, generally
      detrimental state)". D7L3 transiently modulates host physiology without causing disease
      or tissue damage - it is a kratagonist, not a toxin.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      The GO:0090729 definition states: "Interacting selectively with one or more biological
      molecules in another (target) organism, initiating pathogenesis (leading to an abnormal,
      generally detrimental state) in the target organism." D7L3 does NOT meet this definition
      because: (1) It does not initiate pathogenesis - it facilitates blood feeding, not disease;
      (2) It does not cause tissue damage - it transiently sequesters host serotonin;
      (3) The effect is reversible and temporary; (4) The host returns to normal after feeding.
      The UniProt keywords "Hemostasis impairing toxin" that led to this annotation via
      GO_REF:0000043 are technically inaccurate - anti-hemostatic activity through kratagonism
      is fundamentally different from toxin activity. A more accurate MF annotation is
      serotonin binding (GO:0051378).

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is reasonable but somewhat indirect. D7L3 affects blood vessel diameter
      by sequestering serotonin, preventing vasoconstriction. The annotation captures the
      physiological outcome.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      D7L3 does influence blood vessel diameter through its vasodilatory activity, as shown
      by PMID:35460690. However, this is not the core function - it is a downstream consequence
      of serotonin binding and sequestration. The core function is serotonin binding, which
      then prevents serotonin-induced vasoconstriction. This annotation is accurate but
      represents a secondary effect rather than the primary molecular function or biological
      process involvement.

    summary: >-
      D7L3 binds serotonin with high affinity as demonstrated by isothermal titration calorimetry.
      This is the core molecular function of D7L3 and is unusual for a long-form D7 protein.
    action: NEW

      PMID:35460690 demonstrates serotonin binding by D7L3 using PEAQ-ITC: "AngaD7L3 binds

      PMID:35568118 confirms "The unusual D7L, D7L3, can also bind serotonin in the Cellia
      species An. gambiae" - highlighting that serotonin binding in a long-form D7 is unusual.
      UniProt states "Binds serotonin with high affinity (PubMed:35460690, PubMed:35568118)"
      [UniProt A0A1S4HE90]. Importantly, D7L3 is specific for serotonin among biogenic amines -
      it does NOT bind tryptamine, octopamine, dopamine, or adrenaline [UniProt A0A1S4HE90].
      It only binds weakly to noradrenaline and histamine [PMID:35568118]. This makes serotonin
      binding (GO:0051378) the appropriate annotation, NOT histamine binding.
