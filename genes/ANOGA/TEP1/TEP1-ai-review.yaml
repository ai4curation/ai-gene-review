description: >-
  TEP1 (Thioester-containing protein 1) is a secreted complement-like protein
  that plays a central role in the innate immune response of the African malaria
  mosquito Anopheles gambiae. The ~165 kDa glycoprotein contains a conserved
  thioester motif (GCGEQ) that enables covalent attachment to pathogen surfaces,
  functioning as an opsonin to mark pathogens for destruction. TEP1 is expressed
  primarily in the fat body and secreted into the hemolymph, where it circulates
  in complex with LRIM1/APL1C leucine-rich repeat proteins that stabilize the
  active cleaved form (TEP1cut). Upon pathogen challenge, TEP1 binds to microbial
  surfaces (including Plasmodium ookinetes, bacteria, and fungal hyphae), triggering
  either direct lysis or recruitment of the phenoloxidase cascade leading to
  melanization. TEP1 is a key determinant of vectorial capacity, with allelic
  variants (TEP1*R vs TEP1*S) conferring differential resistance to malaria parasites.

      This IEA annotation is derived from the UniProt keyword "Immunity" (KW-0391)
      through automated mapping. While TEP1 is unquestionably an immune protein,
      this term is very high-level. The existing experimental annotations provide
      much more precise terms (antibacterial innate immune response, antifungal
      innate immune response, defense response to symbiont).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Although GO:0002376 "immune system process" is a very general term, it is
      technically correct for TEP1 which functions in innate immunity. The more
      specific IMP/IDA annotations already capture the specific immune functions.
      Retaining this broad IEA annotation is acceptable.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is derived from InterPro domain mapping (IPR001599 and IPR002890)
      which correspond to the alpha-2-macroglobulin family. While alpha-2-macroglobulin
      proteins in vertebrates function as protease inhibitors, TEP1 functions differently
      as a complement-like opsonin. There is no experimental evidence that TEP1 acts
      as an endopeptidase inhibitor in mosquitoes.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      TEP1 is a thioester-containing protein that functions as an opsonin in the
      insect complement-like pathway, not as a protease inhibitor. While it shares
      structural domains with alpha-2-macroglobulin proteins, its functional mechanism
      is different. No experimental evidence supports endopeptidase inhibitor activity.
      This appears to be an over-annotation based on domain homology.

proposed_new_terms: []

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    What is the identity of the protease that cleaves full-length TEP1-F to generate
    the active TEP1cut form?
- question: >-
    Does TEP1 have any function beyond immunity, such as in development or reproduction?
- question: >-
    What are the precise molecular determinants that distinguish TEP1*R and TEP1*S
    allele function?

suggested_experiments:
- description: >-
    Structural characterization of the TEP1-LRIM1-APL1C complex to understand
    the complement-like convertase mechanism.
  hypothesis: >-
    The TEP1-LRIM1-APL1C complex resembles vertebrate complement convertase in
    its structural organization.
- description: >-
    Investigation of TEP1 role in defense against human malaria parasites
    (P. falciparum) rather than rodent models.
  hypothesis: >-
    TEP1 shows similar anti-parasitic activity against human malaria parasites.
- description: >-
    Characterization of TEP1 potential role in male fertility and sperm
    quality control as suggested by UniProt annotation.
  hypothesis: >-
    TEP1 recognizes and eliminates defective sperm cells during spermatogenesis.
