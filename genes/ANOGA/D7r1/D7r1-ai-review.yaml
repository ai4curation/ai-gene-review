description: >-
  D7r1 is a short-form salivary protein from female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes that facilitates
  blood feeding by binding and sequestering host biogenic amines (serotonin and histamine). It
  functions as a "kratagonist" - capturing host signaling molecules with high affinity to prevent
  their vasoconstrictive and inflammatory effects. The protein is secreted into saliva during
  blood feeding and increases clotting time in the host. D7r1 belongs to the PBP/GOBP
  (Pheromone/Odorant-Binding Protein) structural family but has evolved a distinct function
  unrelated to olfaction.

    label: modulation of process of another organism
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation accurately describes D7r1's function. The protein modulates host hemostatic
      and inflammatory responses during blood feeding by sequestering serotonin and histamine.
      This is a correct BP annotation for the cross-species effect.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      D7r1 clearly modulates processes in the vertebrate host. Per UniProt, it "Modulates blood
      feeding of female mosquitoes on vertebrate species by binding and sequestering different
      mediators involved in the host response" [UniProt Q9UB30]. The GO:0035821 definition
      "A process in which an organism effects a change in a biological process in another organism"
      accurately captures this function. The annotation was inferred via GO_REF:0000108 from the
      toxin activity annotation, but the logic is sound - kratagonistic binding of host mediators
      does modulate host processes. Deep research confirms D7 proteins "function as kratagonists -
      high-affinity scavengers of host small-molecule inflammatory and hemostatic mediators"
      [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on structural family membership (PBP/GOBP family via InterPro
      IPR006170) but does not reflect the actual function of D7r1. The protein binds biogenic
      amines (serotonin, histamine), not odorants, and has no role in olfaction.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      D7r1 belongs to the PBP/GOBP structural family (InterPro IPR006170), which led to this
      IEA annotation. However, the D7 proteins have evolutionarily repurposed this fold for
      binding biogenic amines in saliva, not odorants in antennae. D7r1 is expressed exclusively
      in female salivary glands [PMID:9990055, PMID:11841502], not olfactory tissues. The actual
      molecular function is serotonin binding (GO:0051378) and histamine binding (GO:0051381).
      This is a clear case where structural homology does not predict function. The GO:0005549
      definition "Binding to an odorant, any substance capable of stimulating the sense of smell"
      does not apply - serotonin and histamine are not odorants. Deep research confirms "short-form
      D7s (including D7r1) predominantly bind biogenic amines (serotonin/5-HT, histamine,
      epinephrine/norepinephrine)" [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

      This annotation correctly reflects the subcellular localization of D7r1 as a secreted
      salivary protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      D7r1 is a secreted protein with a signal peptide (residues 1-21) [UniProt Q9UB30]. It is
      released into the extracellular space (saliva) during blood feeding. The UniProt entry
      confirms "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted" [UniProt Q9UB30]. This is an appropriate CC
      annotation. Deep research confirms "D7r1 is produced in adult female salivary glands and
      secreted in saliva at the skin interface during probing/feeding"
      [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

    label: toxin activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is an OVER-ANNOTATION. D7r1 does not meet the GO definition of toxin
      activity, which requires "initiating pathogenesis (leading to an abnormal, generally
      detrimental state)". D7r1 transiently modulates host physiology without causing disease
      or tissue damage.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      The GO:0090729 definition states: "Interacting selectively with one or more biological
      molecules in another (target) organism, initiating pathogenesis (leading to an abnormal,
      generally detrimental state) in the target organism." D7r1 does NOT meet this definition
      because: (1) It does not initiate pathogenesis - it facilitates feeding, not disease;
      (2) It does not cause tissue damage - it transiently sequesters host mediators; (3) The
      effect is reversible and temporary; (4) The host returns to normal state after feeding.
      The UniProt keywords "Blood coagulation cascade inhibiting toxin" and "Hemostasis impairing
      toxin" that led to this IEA annotation via GO_REF:0000043 are technically inaccurate -
      anti-hemostatic activity is not equivalent to toxin activity. The kratagonist mechanism
      (sequestering signaling molecules) is fundamentally different from true toxins that cause
      pathological damage. Better annotations would be serotonin binding (GO:0051378) and
      histamine binding (GO:0051381) for MF, and negative regulation of hemostasis
      (GO:1900047) for BP. Deep research explicitly describes the mechanism as kratagonism
      not toxicity [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

    label: serotonin binding
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:16301315
  review:
    summary: >-
      D7r1 binds serotonin with high affinity as demonstrated by direct binding assays. This
      is a core molecular function that should be annotated.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      UniProt confirms "Binds serotonin and histamine (PubMed:16301315)" [UniProt Q9UB30].
      The protein has specific binding sites for serotonin (residues 28, 56, 115, 132, 135).
      This is the actual molecular function that enables kratagonism - sequestering host
      serotonin to prevent vasoconstriction. GO:0051378 definition "Binding to serotonin
      (5-hydroxytryptamine), a monoamine neurotransmitter" accurately describes this function.

      with high affinity" [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].

  review:
    summary: >-
      D7r1 increases blood clotting time in the host, which represents negative regulation of
      hemostasis. This is a core biological process annotation.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      UniProt states "Increases blood clotting time (PubMed:16301315)" [UniProt Q9UB30]. By
      sequestering serotonin (which promotes platelet aggregation) and histamine, D7r1
      negatively regulates the host hemostatic response. GO:1900047 definition "Any process
      that stops, prevents or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of hemostasis" accurately
      captures this function. This is a more accurate BP annotation than inferring from
      "toxin activity". Deep research confirms biogenic amine scavenging "counteracts platelet
      aggregation, vasoconstriction, and nociception during feeding"
      [file:ANOGA/D7r1/D7r1-deep-research-falcon.md].
