description: >-
  PGRP-S1 (AGAP000536) is a short-form peptidoglycan recognition protein in Anopheles gambiae
  that functions as a non-catalytic pattern recognition receptor for bacterial peptidoglycan.
  Unlike other short PGRPs in this species (PGRP-S2/S3), PGRP-S1 lacks the conserved zinc-binding
  catalytic residues required for N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase activity and therefore
  does not hydrolyze peptidoglycan. Instead, it serves as the putative ortholog of Drosophila
  PGRP-SA, suggesting a role in activating Toll pathway-mediated innate immune responses to
  Gram-positive bacteria. It is a secreted, extracellular protein found in hemolymph.

  review:
    summary: >-
      PGRP-S1 is a short-form (S-class) peptidoglycan recognition protein, which are
      characteristically secreted and extracellular. The protein has a signal peptide
      (residues 1-26) predicted by SignalP, consistent with secretion. Short-form PGRPs
      in insects are generally found in hemolymph, cuticle, fat body, and gut epithelium.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Consistent with PGRP biology. Short-form PGRPs are secreted proteins that function
      in the extracellular space to detect bacterial peptidoglycan. The UniProt entry
      confirms a predicted signal peptide (residues 1-26), and the protein belongs to the
      secreted S-class of PGRPs. The IBA annotation from phylogenetic inference is well-supported.

  review:
    summary: >-
      PGRP-S1 is clearly involved in immune response as it is a peptidoglycan recognition
      protein. However, this term is quite general. The more specific term 'innate immune
      response' (GO:0045087) or 'defense response to Gram-positive bacterium' (GO:0050830)
      would be more informative. Given that other more specific immune annotations exist,
      this can be kept as non-core.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      The annotation is correct but redundant with more specific immune annotations.
      PGRP-S1 functions in innate immunity by detecting bacterial peptidoglycan and
      initiating immune signaling. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically supported.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is INCORRECT for PGRP-S1. Multiple comparative analyses demonstrate
      that PGRP-S1 lacks the conserved histidine and zinc-coordinating residues required
      for amidase catalytic activity. In contrast, PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 in A. gambiae retain
      these catalytic residues and are predicted to be functional amidases. PGRP-S1 functions
      as a non-catalytic pattern recognition receptor, not an enzyme.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The annotation is based on the presence of an amidase-like domain (Amidase_2/Pfam PF01510),
      but sequence analysis shows PGRP-S1 lacks the conserved catalytic residues. This represents
      an over-annotation based on domain presence without considering the loss of key functional
      residues. The protein is a non-catalytic receptor analogous to Drosophila PGRP-SA.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This is the correct molecular function for PGRP-S1. As a non-catalytic PGRP that
      lacks amidase activity, PGRP-S1 functions primarily as a pattern recognition receptor
      for bacterial peptidoglycan. It is orthologous to Drosophila PGRP-SA, which activates
      the Toll pathway upon binding Lys-type peptidoglycan. The GO term definition explicitly
      notes that only PGRPs with receptor activity (not just binding) should be annotated
      to this term.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Core molecular function annotation. PGRP-S1 is a non-catalytic peptidoglycan recognition
      protein that functions as an immune receptor. The IBA annotation is well-supported
      by phylogenetic evidence and comparative sequence analysis showing it is the SA-like
      ortholog in Anopheles. The term correctly captures the signaling/receptor function

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is appropriate based on orthology to Drosophila PGRP-SA, which is
      specifically involved in defense against Gram-positive bacteria via the Toll pathway.
      In Drosophila, PGRP-SA recognizes Lys-type peptidoglycan (characteristic of Gram-positive
      bacteria) and activates Toll signaling. PGRP-S1's weak but best-hit orthology to
      PGRP-SA suggests similar specificity.
    action: ACCEPT

      Well-supported by phylogenetic inference. The IBA annotation derives from characterized
      orthologs in Drosophila where PGRP-SA specifically mediates defense against Gram-positive
      bacteria. While direct experimental evidence in Anopheles is lacking, the orthology
      relationship supports this annotation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is problematic for PGRP-S1. While the PGRP domain in general can
      coordinate zinc for amidase activity, PGRP-S1 specifically lacks the conserved
      zinc-coordinating residues. The annotation derives from the InterPro PGRP domain
      (IPR006619) which can encompass both catalytic and non-catalytic PGRPs. For PGRP-S1,
      which is non-catalytic, zinc binding is not established.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The InterPro-based annotation assumes all PGRP domain proteins bind zinc, but this
      is only true for catalytic amidase PGRPs. PGRP-S1 lacks the conserved His/Cys residues
      that coordinate the catalytic zinc. Without these residues, there is no functional
      zinc-binding site. This is an over-annotation based on domain presence.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct. PGRP-S1 contains a PGRP domain that binds peptidoglycan.
      While it lacks catalytic activity, the binding function is retained. The GO term
      definition notes that PGRPs without receptor activity should use this term rather
      than the immune receptor activity term. However, since PGRP-S1 has receptor/signaling
      function, this term is less specific than GO:0016019.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct annotation. PGRP-S1 retains the peptidoglycan binding function even though
      it lacks catalytic activity. The PGRP domain enables recognition and binding of
      bacterial cell wall components. The IEA annotation from InterPro is appropriate.
      This is a valid additional annotation alongside the more specific receptor activity term.

      This is an appropriate biological process annotation for PGRP-S1. As a non-catalytic
      pattern recognition receptor, PGRP-S1's primary function is to detect bacterial
