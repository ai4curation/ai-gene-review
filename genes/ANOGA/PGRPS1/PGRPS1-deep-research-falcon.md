2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PGRPS1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PGRPS1** (gene ID: PGRPS1, UniProt: Q7QFK2) in ANOGA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Functional annotation of Anopheles gambiae PGRP-S1 (AGAP000536; UniProt Q7QFK2)

Verification of target identity and context
- Gene/protein match: PGRP-S1 (AGAP000536) encodes a short-form peptidoglycan recognition protein in Anopheles gambiae that carries a canonical PGRP/amidase-like domain; however, sequence analyses indicate it likely lacks the catalytic zinc-binding residues that confer N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase activity in other PGRPs (therefore functions primarily as a recognition protein rather than a hydrolase) (Christophides 2004; Mendes 2010) (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0127.x; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-9) (christophides2004comparativeandfunctional pages 6-7, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 1-2, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 7-8, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 8-10).
- Organism: Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito) confirmed throughout cited works on Anopheles immunity and PGRPs (christophides2004comparativeandfunctional pages 6-7, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 6-8).
- Family/domains: PGRP family with a bacteriophage/bacterial type 2 amidase-like (N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase) domain; some insect PGRPs are catalytic amidases, others are non-catalytic receptors; PGRP-S1 falls in the latter category by conservation patterns (Dziarski & Gupta 2006; Christophides 2004; Mendes 2010) (https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-8-232; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0127.x; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-9) (dziarski2006thepeptidoglycanrecognition pages 1-2, christophides2004comparativeandfunctional pages 6-7, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 1-2).

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- PGRPs are pattern-recognition proteins that bind bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN). Short-form (S) PGRPs are generally extracellular/secreted and can either act as non-catalytic recognition molecules or as catalytic amidases that hydrolyze PGN to modulate immune signaling (Dziarski & Gupta 2006) (https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-8-232) (dziarski2006thepeptidoglycanrecognition pages 1-2).
- In Anopheles, seven PGRPs are described; among short PGRPs (S1, S2, S3), S2/S3 retain catalytic residues (predicted amidases), whereas S1 does not and is best (though weakly) recognized as the putative ortholog of Drosophila PGRP-SA, a Toll-pathway-associated circulating receptor (Christophides 2004) (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0127.x) (christophides2004comparativeandfunctional pages 6-7).
- IMD/REL2 and Toll pathways: in dipterans, DAP-type PGN sensed by PGRP-LC/LE activates IMD/REL2; Lys-type PGN via PGRP-SA/GNBP activates Toll in flies. In Anopheles, PGRP-LC is a key IMD/REL2 receptor; short amidase PGRPs tune signaling by degrading PGN (Rodgers 2020; Hixson 2024; reviews) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288; https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2023.0063) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 6-8, hixson2024innateimmunityin pages 8-9).

2) Gene/protein-specific function and biochemical properties
- Catalytic capacity: Multiple comparative analyses indicate PGRP-S1 lacks the histidate/zinc-coordination constellation required for amidase activity. Conversely, PGRP-S2/S3 retain these residues (Christophides 2004; Mendes 2010) (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0127.x; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-9) (christophides2004comparativeandfunctional pages 6-7, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 1-2, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 7-8).
- Biochemical role: PGRP-S1 is therefore most consistent with a non-catalytic PGN recognition protein. By orthology, it aligns weakly with Drosophila PGRP-SA, suggesting a role in presenting PGN to the Toll axis rather than hydrolyzing PGN (Christophides 2004; Meister 2006) (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0127.x; https://doi.org/10.11588/heidok.00006571) (christophides2004comparativeandfunctional pages 6-7, meister2006theroleof pages 80-87). Direct substrate specificity (DAP- vs Lys-type PGN) and zinc dependence have not been experimentally demonstrated for Anopheles PGRP-S1; inference from sequence indicates absence of zinc-dependent amidase activity (christophides2004comparativeandfunctional pages 6-7, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 1-2).

3) Expression and localization
- Class-level localization: Short-form PGRPs in insects are secreted/extracellular, present in hemolymph, cuticle, and fat body, and sometimes in gut epithelium/hemocytes (Dziarski & Gupta 2006) (https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-8-232) (dziarski2006thepeptidoglycanrecognition pages 1-2).
- For PGRP-S1 specifically, published Anopheles syntheses classify it among the secreted S-class and consider it the SA-like circulating receptor; however, tissue-resolved expression (midgut vs hemolymph vs hemocytes) for S1 in Anopheles remains sparsely documented in primary experimental studies. Midgut immunity studies in Anopheles predominantly implicate PGRP-LC isoforms and amidase PGRPs (S2/S3 or LB) rather than S1 (Rodgers 2020; Hixson 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288; https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2023.0063) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 6-8, hixson2024innateimmunityin pages 8-9).

4) Pathway roles and biological processes
- Toll vs IMD in Anopheles: PGRP-LC drives IMD/REL2 signaling that regulates AMPs and shapes midgut microbiota; this influences Plasmodium infection intensities (Rodgers 2020; earlier: Meister 2009) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 6-8). Recent analyses show IMD/REL2 is critical for midgut bacterial homeostasis; loss of REL2 causes Serratia overgrowth and rapid mortality, with complex effects on P. falciparum (bioRxiv 2025 preprint) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.14.643338) (zakovic2025themajorrole pages 1-5).
- Amidase PGRPs in gut immunity (context for S1): Catalytic PGRPs attenuate IMD signaling by hydrolyzing PGN, thereby preventing immune overactivation and preserving barrier functions such as the peritrophic matrix (PM). In a malaria-mosquito model, bacterial cell wall components activate the IMD/Rel2 axis that directly promotes peritrophin1 expression and PM formation; knockdown of PGRP-LC/Rel2 reduces Per1 (An. stephensi) (PLOS Biology 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002967) (song2025cellwallcomponents pages 1-2). Regionalization studies indicate anterior midgut executes most AMP expression, with amidase PGRPs contributing to tolerance in the posterior midgut (Hixson 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2023.0063) (hixson2024innateimmunityin pages 8-9).
- Specific evidence about PGRP-S1’s pathway role in Anopheles remains inferential: its SA-like relationship suggests potential involvement in Gram-positive PGN/Toll-related recognition; however, experimental pathway assignment for S1 in Anopheles is not firmly established in current literature (Christophides 2004; Mendes 2010) (christophides2004comparativeandfunctional pages 6-7, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 1-2).

5) Evolutionary and comparative insights specific to PGRP-S1
- Chromosomal location and divergence: PGRP-S1 is X-linked (Xag), whereas PGRP-S2/S3 are tandem duplicates on 2L (~95% identity) (Mendes 2010) (https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-9) (mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 7-8).
- Diversity and selection metrics: In East African populations, PGRP-S1 shows lower nucleotide diversity (π ≈ 0.000–0.008) than S2 (π ≈ 0.009–0.022) and S3 (π ≈ 0.002–0.027), exhibits clear species differentiation between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis (high FST/AMOVA among-species components), and displays neutrality-test departures (e.g., negative Tajima’s D in some samples). By contrast, S2/S3 have Ka/Ks well below 1 (≈0.044/0.058) indicative of purifying selection and show evidence of autosomal introgression/shared haplotypes (Mendes 2010) (https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-9) (mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 1-2, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 7-8, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 3-7, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 2-3).

6) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Gut immunity regionalization and tolerance mechanisms: 2024 analyses emphasize that mosquito midguts are spatially patterned, with anterior midgut/proventriculus dominating AMP expression and amidase PGRPs implicated in tolerance in the posterior midgut; similar anterior-focused patterns are observed in Anopheles (Hixson 2024, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B, Mar 2024; open-access review) (https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2023.0063) (hixson2024innateimmunityin pages 8-9).
- Mechanistic linkage of IMD/REL2 to PM formation: while published in 2025, a high-quality PLOS Biology paper in a malaria vector model demonstrates that PGN stimulation via PGRP-LC/Rel2 directly controls peritrophin1 and PM formation in the midgut, integrating microbiota-derived PGN sensing with barrier biogenesis (Song et al. 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002967) (song2025cellwallcomponents pages 1-2). This aligns with 2024–2023 reviews reporting amidase PGRPs as negative regulators of IMD and key shapers of microbiota homeostasis (Khan 2023; Li 2024) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1272143; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-024-06161-4) (daou2024characterizinganophelesgambiae pages 18-22, daou2024characterizinganophelesgambiae pages 22-26).
- IMD/REL2 centrality in Anopheles midgut homeostasis: Although a 2025 preprint, work from An. gambiae demonstrates REL2’s essential role in post-bloodmeal bacterial control and survival, consistent with the 2023 doctoral work and 2020 functional studies focusing on PGRP-LC and REL2 (Zakovíc et al. 2025; Rodgers 2020; Zakovic 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.14.643338; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288; https://doi.org/10.18452/25442) (zakovic2025themajorrole pages 1-5, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 6-8, daou2024characterizinganophelesgambiae pages 22-26).

7) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Vector control concepts leverage modulation of mosquito innate immunity and microbiota to reduce Plasmodium transmission. PGRP-LC/IMD-driven antibacterial defenses affect parasite infection intensity, suggesting that tuning PGRP-mediated sensing or amidase activity could alter vector competence (Rodgers 2020; overviews Li 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-024-06161-4) (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 6-8, daou2024characterizinganophelesgambiae pages 22-26). The anterior-biased AMP expression and posterior tolerance described in 2024 reviews inform targeted paratransgenesis or microbiota engineering strategies to compartmentalize antimicrobial outputs while preserving beneficial symbionts (Hixson 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2023.0063) (hixson2024innateimmunityin pages 8-9).

8) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Authoritative reviews emphasize that in mosquitoes the IMD/REL2 pathway, activated by PGRP-LC and modulated by amidase-type PGRPs, is the dominant antibacterial axis in the gut; amidase PGRPs enforce tolerance to commensals, preventing dysbiosis and barrier disruption. These principles are consistent across Aedes and Anopheles and align with functional midgut studies (Hixson 2024; Khan 2023; Li 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2023.0063; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1272143; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-024-06161-4) (hixson2024innateimmunityin pages 8-9, daou2024characterizinganophelesgambiae pages 18-22, daou2024characterizinganophelesgambiae pages 22-26).
- For PGRP-S1 specifically, authoritative genomic syntheses agree it is an SA-like, non-catalytic S-class PGRP and is evolutionarily distinct from the amidase S2/S3 duplicates; direct functional assays in mosquitoes remain limited, so functional assignment relies on conserved features and orthology (Christophides 2004; Mendes 2010) (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0127.x; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-9) (christophides2004comparativeandfunctional pages 6-7, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 1-2, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 7-8).

9) Relevant statistics and data
- Evolutionary/population data (An. gambiae/arabiensis, East Africa): PGRP-S1 π ≈ 0.000–0.008 (low diversity); PGRP-S2 π ≈ 0.009–0.022; PGRP-S3 π ≈ 0.002–0.027; Ka/Ks S2 ≈ 0.044, S3 ≈ 0.058 (purifying selection); AMOVA indicates strong between-species structure for S1 (FST up to ~0.95 in some comparisons), but not for S2/S3, which show shared haplotypes consistent with autosomal introgression (Mendes 2010) (https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-9) (mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 1-2, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 7-8, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 3-7, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 2-3).
- Quantitative gut-immunity examples (context): PGRP-LC RNAi increased bacterial load ~2-fold in sugar-fed and ~6-fold post-bloodmeal mosquitoes; amidase PGRP-LB knockdown in a malaria mosquito model altered AMPs/ROS and led to ~500-fold shifts in culturable microbes; REL2 depletion in An. gambiae midgut led to lethal dysbiosis dominated by Serratia within 24 h post-bloodmeal (Daou 2024 summary; Zakovíc 2025 preprint) (daou2024characterizinganophelesgambiae pages 22-26, zakovic2025themajorrole pages 1-5).

Limitations and ambiguity statement for PGRP-S1
- The gene symbol PGRP-S1 is unambiguous in the mosquito literature when tied to AGAP000536. However, direct gene-specific experimental data on enzymatic activity, precise substrate specificity (DAP vs Lys), and in vivo pathway assignment in Anopheles are limited. The weight of comparative evidence supports that PGRP-S1 is non-catalytic (lacks amidase Zn/catalytic residues) and is SA-like in orthology, implying a recognition role rather than PGN hydrolysis. Conclusions about pathway involvement (e.g., Toll) are thus inferential and should be tested experimentally (Christophides 2004; Mendes 2010) (christophides2004comparativeandfunctional pages 6-7, mendes2010molecularevolutionof pages 1-2).

Conclusions
- Anopheles gambiae PGRP-S1 (AGAP000536; Q7QFK2) is a short, secreted PGRP most consistent with a non-catalytic PGN recognition role analogous to Drosophila PGRP-SA. It likely acts in extracellular recognition rather than PGN hydrolysis; amidase roles in Anopheles gut immunity are fulfilled by other PGRPs (e.g., S2/S3, LB) that retain catalytic residues. Contemporary mosquito research (2023–2024) highlights the centrality of IMD/REL2 signaling and amidase PGRPs in shaping midgut microbiota and the peritrophic matrix, with strong regionalization of immune outputs along the gut. While these developments frame PGRP-S1’s likely functional niche, definitive Anopheles-specific biochemical and pathway data for S1 remain an open area for focused experimentation (dziarski2006thepeptidoglycanrecognition pages 1-2, christophides2004comparativeandfunctional pages 6-7, hixson2024innateimmunityin pages 8-9, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 6-8, daou2024characterizinganophelesgambiae pages 22-26).
