taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:7165
  label: Anopheles gambiae
description: Agaphelin is a mosquito salivary protein containing a single Kazal domain
  that functions as a highly selective serine protease inhibitor. It specifically
  targets neutrophil elastase (ELANE) and proteinase 3 (PRTN3) with high affinity,
  preventing blood coagulation and inflammatory responses during blood feeding. The
  protein is secreted in saliva and its expression is significantly upregulated upon
  Plasmodium falciparum infection, suggesting a role in facilitating parasite transmission.
  Agaphelin exhibits anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory activities without causing
  bleeding complications by preserving hemostasis.

    label: modulation of process of another organism
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: This annotation is appropriate but too general. Agaphelin specifically
      modulates host hemostatic and inflammatory responses during blood feeding, which
      is captured by this term.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This is the primary molecular function of Agaphelin. Strong experimental
      evidence from PMID:25211214 shows it specifically inhibits serine proteases,
      particularly neutrophil elastase and proteinase 3.

  review:
    summary: Correct cellular component. Agaphelin is secreted in mosquito saliva
      and functions in the extracellular space during blood feeding.

    label: peptidase inhibitor activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This is a parent term of GO:0004867 (serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor
      activity). While correct, the more specific child term better describes Agaphelin
      function.

    label: toxin activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: Appropriate annotation. Agaphelin acts as a salivary toxin that modulates
      host responses during blood feeding, though it does not cause harmful effects
      like traditional toxins.

      Agaphelin role in blood feeding through inhibition of host hemostatic responses.

  evidence_type: IPI
  original_reference_id: PMID:25211214
  review:
    summary: While the IPI evidence shows Agaphelin binds to ELANE, this general term
      is not informative. The specific serine protease inhibitor activity (GO:0004867)
      better captures the functional significance of this binding.

  review:
    summary: Good experimental evidence, but the more specific term GO:0004867 (serine-type
      endopeptidase inhibitor activity) would be more appropriate given the specificity
      demonstrated in the paper.
