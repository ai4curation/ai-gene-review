# Agaphelin (Anopheles gambiae) – Comprehensive Gene Analysis

## Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
**Agaphelin** is a small salivary protein (≈6.3 kDa, 54 amino acids mature form) that functions as a **serine protease inhibitor**, specifically targeting neutrophil elastase and related proteases ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Aedes%20sp%20and%20Culex%20sp,Agaphelin%20also%20blocks%20elastase%2Fcathepsin)) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Kazal,or%20residual%20activity%20against%20other)). It contains a canonical *Kazal-type inhibitory domain* with a reactive-site leucine at the P1 position, which confers selectivity for elastase (a neutrophil serine protease) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=structurally%20similar%20to%20those%20of,34)). Biochemical studies with synthetic Agaphelin demonstrated **tight-binding, slow-offrate inhibition** of human neutrophil elastase (K_D ~10 nM) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Aedes%20sp%20and%20Culex%20sp,Agaphelin%20also%20blocks%20elastase%2Fcathepsin)). Notably, Agaphelin shows little or no inhibitory activity against other enzymes like thrombin, trypsin or metalloproteases, indicating a high specificity for its target proteases ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Aedes%20sp%20and%20Culex%20sp,Agaphelin%20also%20blocks%20elastase%2Fcathepsin)) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Kazal,or%20residual%20activity%20against%20other)). Unlike some mosquito salivary factors, Agaphelin does *not* exhibit vasodilatory or antimicrobial properties, underscoring its specialized role in targeting host immune/hemostatic factors ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=chemically%20synthesized%20Agaphelin%20behaves%20as,Agaphelin%20also%20blocks%20elastase%2Fcathepsin)) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Kazal,ATCC%2025922)). Mechanistically, as a **Kazal-family** inhibitor, Agaphelin likely blocks enzyme active sites via its reactive loop, thereby preventing substrate cleavage. By inhibiting neutrophil elastase (and to some extent neutrophil proteinase-3 and chymotrypsin ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Kazal,or%20residual%20activity%20against%20other))), Agaphelin **suppresses downstream effects of these proteases** – for example, it prevents elastase-mediated cleavage of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and blocks elastase/cathepsin-induced platelet activation ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=several%20parameter%20associated%20with%20cell,arterial%20thrombosis%2C%20without%20impairing%20hemostasis)). This **antielastase activity** yields multiple functional outcomes, including anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects, as detailed below.  

## Cellular Localization and Secretion  
Agaphelin is a **secreted protein** that is produced in the mosquito’s salivary glands and delivered into the host during blood feeding. The Agaphelin precursor includes an N-terminal signal peptide that is cleaved (between residues AEA–DI) to facilitate secretion into saliva ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=not%20find%20differential%20expression%20upon,with%20other%20Diptera%20family%20members)). This signal peptide and the small size are characteristic of salivary peptide effectors. Gene expression analyses show **high expression in female salivary glands**, consistent with its role in blood meal acquisition ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=as%20the%20D7%20family%20and,with%20other%20Diptera%20family%20members)). In addition to salivary tissue, low-level Agaphelin expression has been detected in the midgut epithelium ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Kazal,30%5D%2C%20but%20we%20did)), although its midgut function is unclear (no significant change upon infection was observed in that tissue). Within the context of Gene Ontology (GO), Agaphelin would be associated with the **extracellular region** (GO:0005576) as its cellular component, given that it is exported out of the cell and functions in the extracellular milieu (host skin/tissue fluid during biting). Indeed, the protein is part of the saliva cocktail that interacts with host blood and immune cells outside the mosquito.  

## Biological Processes and Roles  
Agaphelin is intimately involved in **biological processes related to blood feeding and immune evasion**. As an anti-hemostatic factor, it helps the mosquito obtain a blood meal by counteracting the host’s clotting and inflammatory responses. Functional studies demonstrate that Agaphelin **inhibits key events in clot formation and inflammation**. By blocking neutrophil elastase, Agaphelin prevents the protease-driven activation of coagulation and platelet aggregation pathways ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=several%20parameter%20associated%20with%20cell,arterial%20thrombosis%2C%20without%20impairing%20hemostasis)). It effectively **reduces platelet aggregation** (by preventing elastase/cathepsin G-mediated platelet activation) and preserves anticoagulant factors like TFPI in the bite site ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=several%20parameter%20associated%20with%20cell,arterial%20thrombosis%2C%20without%20impairing%20hemostasis)). This leads to a **negative regulation of blood coagulation** (GO:0030195) and **platelet activation** at the feeding site, keeping blood in a fluid state for the mosquito to ingest. At the same time, Agaphelin targets neutrophil functions: it significantly **inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis** toward chemoattractants ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=promotes%20vasodilation%2C%20or%20exhibit%20antimicrobial,NETs%29%20formation%20and)), indicating a role in the **negative regulation of neutrophil migration** (GO:0090024). In an ex vivo assay, the presence of Agaphelin impaired neutrophils’ directed movement, reducing their accumulation at sites of inflammation ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=promotes%20vasodilation%2C%20or%20exhibit%20antimicrobial,NETs%29%20formation%20and)). Furthermore, Agaphelin was shown to **block the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)** ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=injection%20of%20carrageenan%20in%20mice,arterial%20thrombosis%2C%20without%20impairing%20hemostasis)). NETs are web-like DNA/protein structures released by activated neutrophils that trap pathogens but also promote coagulation and inflammation. By inhibiting NET formation, Agaphelin contributes to **modulating the host innate immune response**, effectively **suppressing an inflammatory, pro-thrombotic cascade** at the mosquito bite. Consistent with these functions, Agaphelin exhibited **anti-inflammatory activity in vivo**: in a mouse model of acute inflammation, Agaphelin injection reduced neutrophil infiltration and tissue edema ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=promotes%20vasodilation%2C%20or%20exhibit%20antimicrobial,NETs%29%20formation%20and)). Importantly, all of these anti-hemostatic and anti-inflammatory effects occur *without causing undue bleeding or affecting baseline hemostasis*. Experimental thrombus models in mice showed that Agaphelin **prevents arterial thrombosis** (e.g. in FeCl_3-induced carotid artery injury) yet does not prolong normal clotting times or induce hemorrhage ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=injection%20of%20carrageenan%20in%20mice,arterial%20thrombosis%2C%20without%20impairing%20hemostasis)). This unique profile – **antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory without bleeding side-effects** – points to a finely tuned evolutionary adaptation. In GO terms, Agaphelin’s roles can be summarized as **negative regulation of coagulation** and **negative regulation of inflammatory response** in the host (especially targeting neutrophil-mediated pathways). Additionally, from the host perspective, Agaphelin is an example of a factor involved in **“modulation by symbiont of host immune process”** (a category describing how a parasite or symbiotic organism alters host defenses). Overall, Agaphelin’s activities facilitate successful blood feeding and may enhance parasite transmission by creating a more permissive environment at the bite site ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Blockade%20of%20neutrophil%20elastase%20emerges,host%20interactions)) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=understood,and%20the%20innate%20immune%20response)).  

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
Although Agaphelin is a mosquito gene, it is deeply tied to disease contexts **through vector-host-parasite interactions**. Its discovery came from the observation that Plasmodium falciparum (the malaria parasite) infection significantly upregulates Agaphelin in An. gambiae salivary glands ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Among%20the%20genes%20that%20were,a%2054%20amino%20acid%20long)). This suggests that **Agaphelin plays a role in malaria transmission**. By dampening the host’s hemostatic and innate immune responses, Agaphelin likely improves the efficiency of sporozoite injection and survival during a mosquito bite, indirectly benefiting the malaria parasite’s invasion of the host ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Blockade%20of%20neutrophil%20elastase%20emerges,host%20interactions)) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=understood,and%20the%20innate%20immune%20response)). The *induced expression upon parasite infection* is a unique feature – Agaphelin is the first known mosquito anti-hemostatic factor that is **parasite-inducible** ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=first%20antihemostatic%20whose%20expression%20is,host%20interactions)). This indicates a co-evolutionary interplay: the parasite may gain a transmission advantage by triggering the mosquito to secrete more Agaphelin, which in turn suppresses host defenses at the bite. From the mosquito’s perspective, there is no known detrimental phenotype to the insect from producing Agaphelin; rather, it aids in blood meal acquisition which is essential for mosquito reproduction. Experimental gene knockdown data for Agaphelin in mosquitoes have not been prominently reported, but one would predict that loss of Agaphelin could result in **reduced feeding success** or **more robust host blood clotting/inflammation** at bites, potentially impacting mosquito fitness or parasite transmission.  

Beyond the vector context, Agaphelin’s potent activities have drawn interest in mammalian disease models. It has been tested as a therapeutic agent in inflammatory and thrombotic conditions, given its ability to inhibit neutrophil-driven pathology *without* causing bleeding. In a mouse model of **acute ischemic stroke**, administration of Agaphelin was strikingly protective ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=intracerebral%20bleeding%20risk%2C%20blood,identifies%20agaphelin%20as%20a%20promising)). Treated mice showed **smaller infarct volumes, improved neurological outcomes, and reduced mortality** compared to controls ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=intracerebral%20bleeding%20risk%2C%20blood,identifies%20agaphelin%20as%20a%20promising)). The protection correlated with **reduced microvascular thrombosis, preserved blood–brain barrier integrity, and dampened brain inflammation**, aligning with Agaphelin’s known anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=intracerebral%20bleeding%20risk%2C%20blood,identifies%20agaphelin%20as%20a%20promising)). Notably, even at therapeutically effective doses, Agaphelin did *not* increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in these stroke models ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=intracerebral%20bleeding%20risk%2C%20blood,identifies%20agaphelin%20as%20a%20promising)). This suggests Agaphelin (or derivatives) could be a promising antithrombotic agent where minimizing bleeding risk is crucial. Another study examined Agaphelin in the context of **airway inflammation**: human bronchial epithelial cells stimulated with pro-inflammatory signals (IL-4 and bacterial LPS) produced less CCL2 and IL-8 chemokines when co-treated with Agaphelin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=agaphelin%20%28Waisberg%20et%20al,8)). By **modulating epithelial cell activation** and reducing chemokine release, Agaphelin showed an ability to lessen potentially harmful inflammation in the respiratory tract ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=agaphelin%20%28Waisberg%20et%20al,8)). These findings highlight Agaphelin’s translational potential and reinforce its role in suppressing neutrophil-driven inflammatory pathways. While Agaphelin itself is not associated with a genetic disease (being insect-derived), its **activities intersect with human pathological processes** such as thrombosis, stroke, and inflammatory diseases. In summary, **Agaphelin contributes to the pathology (or rather the facilitation) of malaria infection** by helping the parasite circumvent host defenses, yet conversely it exhibits therapeutic potential *against* certain human diseases characterized by excessive thrombosis and inflammation.  

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
Agaphelin belongs to the **Kazal-type family of serine protease inhibitors**, characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich domain. The Agaphelin protein has a single Kazal domain (~50–60 amino acids in length) containing **six conserved cysteine residues** that form three intramolecular disulfide bonds (Cys1–Cys5, Cys2–Cys4, Cys3–Cys6) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Within%20the%20Kazal%20domain%2C%20there,shows%20a%20high%20level%20of)). This disulfide-bonded structure yields a stable **canonical Kazal fold**: a compact globular domain with a short central α-helix packed against a two-stranded β-sheet, and a third β-strand near the C-terminus ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=structural%20conservation%20of%20Agaphelin%20with,located%20at%20position)). The Kazal domain presents a solvent-exposed **reactive loop** that serves as a “bait” for target proteases. In Agaphelin, the **P1 reactive site residue is leucine** ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=structurally%20similar%20to%20those%20of,34)), which is a critical determinant of its inhibitory specificity. Kazal inhibitors typically follow the standard inhibitor-substrate mechanism, inserting their reactive loop into the enzyme’s active site. The P1 Leu of Agaphelin is consistent with preference for elastase-like proteases (which favor hydrophobic residues) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=structurally%20similar%20to%20those%20of,34)), and indeed functional assays confirmed Agaphelin potently inhibits elastase and related neutrophil proteases ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Kazal,or%20residual%20activity%20against%20other)). The mature Agaphelin peptide (after signal peptide removal) is only 54 amino acids, with a **predicted isoelectric point of ~5.1** and an observed molecular mass around 6.2 kDa ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=as%20the%20D7%20family%20and,with%20other%20Diptera%20family%20members)). Despite its small size, circular dichroism analysis indicates it has substantial α-helical content, reflecting a well-folded structure stabilized by the disulfide network ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Consistent%20with%20the%20structure%20of,of%20the%20experimental%20circular%20dichroism)). A homology-based structural model of Agaphelin shows **close structural overlap with other Kazal inhibitors**, such as Infestin-4 and Anemonia elastase inhibitor, reinforcing that it conforms to the conserved Kazal domain architecture ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=structural%20conservation%20of%20Agaphelin%20with,located%20at%20position)) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Arthropoda%20organisms.%20Agaphelin%20has%2041,type%20inhibitor%20from%20the%20black)). This structural conservation is important for function: the geometry of the reactive loop and the positioning of the P1 residue in Agaphelin are nearly **canonical for elastase-specific inhibitors** ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=structural%20conservation%20of%20Agaphelin%20with,located%20at%20position)). No additional known domains are present in Agaphelin – it essentially *is* a single Kazal domain peptide. This minimalist design (common in mosquito salivary inhibitors) allows for rapid synthesis and secretion of the inhibitor. **Domain analysis** in VectorBase/NCBI confirms Agaphelin as a single-exon gene encoding a Kazal-domain protein (with the PROSITE Kazal signature). There are no glycosylation motifs or other post-translational modifications noted, aside from the signal peptide cleavage. In summary, Agaphelin’s **structure-function relationship** is defined by its Kazal domain: the disulfide-stabilized fold and the reactive site loop together confer a high-affinity, specific inhibition of target serine proteases.  

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
Agaphelin’s expression is highly **tissue- and context-specific**. Under normal conditions, Agaphelin mRNA is most abundantly expressed in the **female mosquito’s salivary glands**, which correlates with its role in blood feeding. The gene appears to be **female-specific or female-biased**, since only female Anopheles mosquitoes take blood meals and invest in producing salivary antihemostatic factors. Transcriptomic data from *An. gambiae* (strain PEST) show that **salivary glands have significantly higher Agaphelin transcript levels than other tissues** (like carcass, midgut, etc.), aligning with it being a saliva protein. Notably, one study did detect **Agaphelin transcripts in the midgut** as well ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Kazal,30%5D%2C%20but%20we%20did)), though at much lower levels than in salivary tissue. The biological significance of midgut expression remains uncertain; it might suggest a secondary role (e.g. protecting the midgut from ingested blood coagulation, similar to how triatomine bugs use midgut anti-coagulants) or could be a constitutive low-level expression with no major function unless induced.  

Crucially, **Agaphelin expression is upregulated by malaria parasite infection**. In a microarray analysis comparing salivary glands of *Plasmodium falciparum*-infected vs. uninfected *An. gambiae*, Agaphelin was one of the most strongly induced genes ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Among%20the%20genes%20that%20were,a%2054%20amino%20acid%20long)). Its transcript levels in infected glands were ~15-fold higher than in uninfected controls ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Among%20the%20genes%20that%20were,a%2054%20amino%20acid%20long)). This infection-responsive regulation was validated by independent methods (Nanostring), confirming that *P. falciparum* invasion of the salivary gland triggers Agaphelin upregulation. Interestingly, other common salivary anti-clotting genes (e.g., D7 proteins, apyrase) did not show such changes ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Among%20the%20genes%20that%20were,a%2054%20amino%20acid%20long)), making Agaphelin’s induction a relatively specific response. The regulatory mechanism behind this induction is not fully elucidated – it could involve parasite-secreted factors or immune signaling pathways in the mosquito that sense the parasite’s presence and in turn activate the Agaphelin gene promoter. The timing of expression suggests that by the time sporozoites are ready to be transmitted (roughly 2–3 weeks after the mosquito ingested an infected blood meal), the mosquito’s salivary gland cells are producing elevated levels of Agaphelin. This timing would maximize Agaphelin’s effect when the mosquito bites a new host, thereby aiding parasite transmission. Beyond infection, **Agaphelin expression can also be transiently influenced by blood feeding** itself. While specific data on blood-meal induction are not provided in the original study, many salivary genes in mosquitoes have their expression modulated after a blood meal due to stretch or hormonal signals. It’s plausible that Agaphelin mRNA or protein levels rise as part of the post-blood meal phase or are maintained for subsequent feedings, but this remains to be confirmed experimentally. 

In summary, **Agaphelin is tightly regulated**, with strong basal expression in salivary glands of feeding females and a notable boost in expression in response to malaria parasite infection. This suggests an adaptation where the mosquito (or the parasite via the mosquito) ensures ample production of this inhibitor when it is most needed for successful blood feeding and parasite transmission. For gene ontology, the expression pattern is reflected in its association with **salivary gland** function and **response to symbiont (parasite) presence**.  

## Evolutionary Conservation and Homology  
Agaphelin is part of an **evolutionarily conserved family of insect protease inhibitors**. Orthologs and close homologs of Agaphelin are found in other mosquito species and blood-feeding insects, indicating that this anti-hemostatic strategy arose early and was maintained in hematophagous lineages. In fact, Agaphelin shows high sequence similarity to putative salivary Kazal-domain proteins from *Aedes* and *Culex* mosquitoes ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Agaphelin%2C%20a%2058,plasmon%20resonance%20experiments%20determined%20that)). This suggests that the common ancestor of Anopheline and Culicine mosquitoes (which diverged over 100 million years ago) already possessed a Kazal-type salivary inhibitor gene, and that gene diverged into lineage-specific versions (the term “Agaphelin” specifically refers to the An. gambiae version). The **Dipteran salivary Kazal inhibitors** seem to form an expanded clade in phylogenetic analyses ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=The%20phylogenetic%20tree%20%28Fig,to%20defense%20against%20microorganisms%20and)). Beyond mosquitoes, similar proteins are found in other blood-sucking arthropods: for example, Agaphelin shares ~41% amino acid identity with **Infestin 4**, a Kazal-type inhibitor from the gut of the kissing bug *Triatoma infestans* (a vector of Chagas disease) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Arthropoda%20organisms.%20Agaphelin%20has%2041,type%20inhibitor%20from%20the%20black)). Infestin-4 is an inhibitor of Factor XIIa and other clotting enzymes, used by triatomine bugs to prevent bloodmeal clotting in their midgut. Agaphelin also has ~38% identity to **Rhodniin**, a specific thrombin inhibitor from *Rhodnius prolixus* (another triatomine bug) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Arthropoda%20organisms.%20Agaphelin%20has%2041,to%20defense%20against%20microorganisms%20and)). This level of similarity indicates a conserved core structure and perhaps a common evolutionary origin (or convergent evolution under similar selection pressures for blood-feeding). Additionally, an orthologous Kazal inhibitor in *Aedes aegypti* (dengue mosquito) was identified with anti-thrombin activity ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Arthropoda%20organisms.%20Agaphelin%20has%2041,to%20defense%20against%20microorganisms%20and)), and Agaphelin clusters with these mosquito sequences in phylogenetic trees ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=The%20phylogenetic%20tree%20%28Fig,to%20defense%20against%20microorganisms%20and)). The **Kazal inhibitor family** is not confined to insects; it spans a wide range of metazoans. Agaphelin, for instance, shares ~35% identity with the **Anemonia elastase inhibitor (AEI)** from sea anemone (a marine organism) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Arthropoda%20organisms.%20Agaphelin%20has%2041,type%20inhibitor%20from%20the%20black)), underlining that the Kazal fold is ancient and versatile. However, within arthropods, many Kazal inhibitors have specialized functions – some in blood feeding, others in defense. In lepidopteran insects (moths/butterflies), certain Kazal-like proteins protect against microbes or predators rather than blood coagulation ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Rhodniin%2C%20a%20specific%20thrombin%20inhibitor,indicating%20different%20functions%20of%20proteins)). In the context of Agaphelin, its closest functional homologs are those in fellow bloodsuckers, especially flies and bugs that feed on vertebrate blood. Interestingly, some biting flies (horseflies, Tabanidae) have Kazal-family proteins like **vasotab** (a vasodilator Kazal protein) that cluster separately from Agaphelin in phylogenies, reflecting divergent functions despite structural similarity ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=tiger%20shrimp%20Penaeus%20monodon%20showed,indicating%20different%20functions%20of%20proteins)). Within the *Anopheles* genus itself, orthologs of Agaphelin likely exist in other species (e.g., *Anopheles stephensi*, *Anopheles albimanus*, etc., may have a gene encoding a similar Kazal-domain peptide). Given the strong conservation among mosquito orthologs, these genes probably collectively form an *“Agaphelin family”* of salivary inhibitors. This evolutionary distribution underscores the importance of Kazal inhibitors as a **common adaptive strategy** in blood-feeding species: through independent evolution or descent, many such organisms arrived at small cysteine-rich inhibitors to combat host clotting and immunity. For GO annotation purposes, this conservation highlights that Agaphelin is an **insect salivary protein (insect protein, salivary peptide)** ([meshb.nlm.nih.gov](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=C000603320#:~:text=2%20Note%20has%20antiplatelet%2C%20antithrombotic%2C,of%20Entry%202015%2F12%2F06%20Revision%20Date)), and part of a conserved functional category of anti-hemostatic molecules across species.  

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
- **Waisberg et al., 2014 (PLoS Pathogens)** – This study **identified and characterized Agaphelin** ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Using%20Affimetrix%20chip%20microarray%2C%20we,not%20affect%20other%20enzymes%2C%20nor)) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Among%20the%20genes%20that%20were,be%20cleaved%20between%20residues%20AEA%E2%80%93DI)). Using microarrays, the authors found Agaphelin was highly upregulated in *An. gambiae* salivary glands after *P. falciparum* infection ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Among%20the%20genes%20that%20were,a%2054%20amino%20acid%20long)). They cloned and chemically synthesized the peptide, confirming it contains a single Kazal domain and is secreted in saliva ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=as%20the%20D7%20family%20and,with%20other%20Diptera%20family%20members)). They demonstrated through kinetic assays that Agaphelin is a potent inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (with ~10 nM affinity) and proteinase-3, but not of other enzymes ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Aedes%20sp%20and%20Culex%20sp,Agaphelin%20also%20blocks%20elastase%2Fcathepsin)) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Kazal,or%20residual%20activity%20against%20other)). Functional assays in vitro showed **Agaphelin inhibits neutrophil migration** towards chemoattractants ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=promotes%20vasodilation%2C%20or%20exhibit%20antimicrobial,NETs%29%20formation%20and)) and **prevents NET formation** ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=injection%20of%20carrageenan%20in%20mice,arterial%20thrombosis%2C%20without%20impairing%20hemostasis)). In vivo tests in mice showed **Agaphelin blocks arterial thrombosis without prolonging bleeding time**, and it reduces inflammation (paw edema and myeloperoxidase accumulation) in a carrageenan injection model ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=promotes%20vasodilation%2C%20or%20exhibit%20antimicrobial,arterial%20thrombosis%2C%20without%20impairing%20hemostasis)). This paper also included sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, establishing the homology of Agaphelin to other Kazal-family inhibitors in various blood-feeding arthropods ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=The%20phylogenetic%20tree%20%28Fig,type%20inhibitor%20from%20the%20black)). It is the foundational reference defining Agaphelin’s sequence, structure, and function.  

- **Leinweber et al., 2021 (Brain Behav. Immun.)** – This work investigated **Agaphelin as a therapeutic** in a **mouse stroke model**. It confirmed prior findings that Agaphelin has multiple antithrombotic effects without bleeding risk ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=Recently%20it%20was%20shown%20that,Thrombus%20formation)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20have%20shown%20that,PT%29%20in%20vitro)). Mice treated with Agaphelin immediately after inducing transient ischemic stroke had significantly better outcomes: smaller brain infarcts, improved neurological scores, and lower mortality, compared to untreated controls ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=intracerebral%20bleeding%20risk%2C%20blood,identifies%20agaphelin%20as%20a%20promising)). The improvement was mechanistically linked to Agaphelin’s inhibition of neutrophil elastase – treated mice had reduced fibrin-rich microthrombi in cerebral microvessels, less blood–brain barrier damage, and decreased neutrophil infiltration in the brain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=intracerebral%20bleeding%20risk%2C%20blood,identifies%20agaphelin%20as%20a%20promising)). Importantly, there was **no increase in hemorrhagic complications** with Agaphelin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=intracerebral%20bleeding%20risk%2C%20blood,identifies%20agaphelin%20as%20a%20promising)). This study provided strong evidence that targeting neutrophil proteases (as Agaphelin does) can mitigate stroke injury, highlighting Agaphelin’s relevance to pathological thrombo-inflammation in mammals.  

- **Favarin et al., 2020** (reported in Leinweber et al. intro) – This study looked at **Agaphelin’s effect on human bronchial epithelial cells** during inflammatory stimulation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20reduced%20neutrophil%20chemotaxis%20was,8)). Although the full details are in a separate publication, it is noted that Agaphelin treatment reduced the production of key chemokines (CCL2/MCP-1 and IL-8) by airway epithelial cells in response to IL-4 and LPS ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=agaphelin%20%28Waisberg%20et%20al,8)). This suggests Agaphelin can modulate cell signaling pathways that lead to chemokine release, further demonstrating its anti-inflammatory potential in diverse contexts (here, respiratory inflammation).  

- **MeSH (2024)** – Agaphelin has been assigned a MeSH Supplementary Concept entry (UID C000603320) as *“agaphelin protein, Anopheles gambiae”*. The MeSH notes summarize that Agaphelin **has antiplatelet, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory activities and is isolated from the mosquito** ([meshb.nlm.nih.gov](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=C000603320#:~:text=2%20Note%20has%20antiplatelet%2C%20antithrombotic%2C,of%20Entry%202015%2F12%2F06%20Revision%20Date)), citing the 2014 PLoS Pathogens paper as the source. This recognizes Agaphelin in biomedical literature and aids indexing for researchers.  

These key references provide a comprehensive understanding of Agaphelin’s biology, from gene discovery and molecular function to its implications in vector biology and potential medical applications. Future studies may explore Agaphelin homologs in other species, its regulation mechanism in the mosquito, and possible development of Agaphelin-derived inhibitors for clinical use.

## Relevant GO Terms (Summary)  
Based on the above evidence, the following Gene Ontology terms are applicable for Agaphelin:  

- **Molecular Function:** *serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity* (GO:0004867) – Agaphelin binds and inhibits serine proteases like elastase ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=Aedes%20sp%20and%20Culex%20sp,Agaphelin%20also%20blocks%20elastase%2Fcathepsin)).  
- **Biological Process:** *negative regulation of blood coagulation* (GO:0030195) – prevents clotting and thrombosis during feeding ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=injection%20of%20carrageenan%20in%20mice,arterial%20thrombosis%2C%20without%20impairing%20hemostasis)); *negative regulation of neutrophil chemotaxis* (GO:0090024) – impairs neutrophil migration to the bite site ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=promotes%20vasodilation%2C%20or%20exhibit%20antimicrobial,NETs%29%20formation%20and)); *negative regulation of neutrophil extracellular trap formation* (no GO ID listed) – inhibits NET release by neutrophils ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=injection%20of%20carrageenan%20in%20mice,arterial%20thrombosis%2C%20without%20impairing%20hemostasis)); *negative regulation of inflammatory response* (GO:0050728) – general suppression of inflammation (e.g., reduced edema and chemokine levels) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=promotes%20vasodilation%2C%20or%20exhibit%20antimicrobial,NETs%29%20formation%20and)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979502/#:~:text=agaphelin%20%28Waisberg%20et%20al,8)). Additionally, as a vector protein it is involved in *modulation by symbiont of host immune process* (e.g., related to GO:0052553) given its role in altering host hemostatic and immune responses ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=understood,and%20the%20innate%20immune%20response)).  
- **Cellular Component:** *extracellular region* (GO:0005576) – Agaphelin is secreted in saliva into the host’s extravascular space ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004338#:~:text=not%20find%20differential%20expression%20upon,with%20other%20Diptera%20family%20members)). It can also be associated with *salivary gland lumen* (contextual localization within the mosquito, though not a standard GO term, the protein is present in saliva).  

Each of these GO annotations can be supported by experimental evidence from the literature cited above. Agaphelin’s discovery and characterization exemplify how transcriptomic data and functional assays inform precise GO annotation for a gene product, linking molecular function to biological processes and cellular context in a multi-organism interaction scenario.
