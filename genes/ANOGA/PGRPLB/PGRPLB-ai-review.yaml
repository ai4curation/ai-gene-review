description: >-
  PGRP-LB (AGAP001212) is a long-form peptidoglycan recognition protein in Anopheles gambiae
  that functions as a catalytic N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase. Unlike the non-catalytic
  short-form PGRP-S1, PGRP-LB retains the conserved zinc-binding catalytic residues required
  for enzymatic activity. It degrades bacterial peptidoglycan (particularly DAP-type from
  Gram-negative bacteria) to reduce immunostimulatory peptidoglycan fragments, thereby
  serving as a negative regulator of the IMD/REL2 innate immune signaling pathway. This
  amidase activity maintains gut immune homeostasis by preventing excessive antimicrobial
  peptide responses to commensal bacteria. PGRP-LB has a predicted transmembrane domain,
  suggesting it may function at the cell membrane interface in the midgut where it encounters
  microbial peptidoglycan.

  review:
    summary: >-
      PGRP-LB contains a predicted transmembrane helix (residues 7-23) according to UniProt,
      suggesting it is a membrane-anchored protein rather than a purely secreted/extracellular
      protein. This is consistent with long-form PGRPs which can be membrane-associated.
      While it likely acts at the host-microbe interface and may have an extracellular-facing
      domain, the localization annotation should reflect its membrane association.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The UniProt entry clearly indicates a transmembrane helix (residues 7-23) predicted
      by Phobius. Long-form PGRPs like PGRP-LB are typically membrane-associated rather
      than fully secreted like short-form PGRPs. The IBA annotation from phylogenetic
      inference may be based on orthologs with different topologies or may reflect the
      extracellular-facing portion of the protein, but the primary localization should
      acknowledge membrane anchoring.

    summary: >-
      PGRP-LB is clearly involved in the immune response as a component of the innate
      immune system. However, this term is quite general. More specific terms like
      'innate immune response' (GO:0045087) or 'negative regulation of peptidoglycan
      recognition protein signaling pathway' (GO:0061060) would be more informative.
      Given that more specific immune annotations exist, this can be kept as non-core.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Correct but redundant with more specific immune annotations. PGRP-LB functions
      in innate immunity by enzymatically degrading peptidoglycan to modulate IMD/REL2
      signaling. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically supported.

      This is the correct core molecular function for PGRP-LB. Unlike the non-catalytic
      PGRP-S1, PGRP-LB retains the conserved zinc-coordinating residues required for
      N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase activity. This enzymatic activity cleaves the
      amide bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and L-alanine in peptidoglycan stem peptides,
      thereby degrading immunostimulatory peptidoglycan fragments. The UniProt entry
      explicitly states PGRP-LB "Belongs to the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase 2 family"
      and annotates the Amidase_2 domain (Pfam PF01510).

  review:
    summary: >-
      This term is problematic for PGRP-LB. The GO term definition states "Note that only
      peptidoglycan recognition proteins with receptor activity should be annotated to
      this term; otherwise use peptidoglycan binding instead." PGRP-LB is an amidase
      enzyme that degrades peptidoglycan; it is not primarily a receptor that transmits
      signals. While PGRP-LB does bind peptidoglycan (a prerequisite for its enzymatic
      activity), its primary function is catalytic degradation, not signal transduction.
      The receptor function is carried out by non-catalytic PGRPs like PGRP-LC.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      PGRP-LB functions as a peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme, not as an immune receptor.
      The receptor activity term implies signal transduction, but PGRP-LB's role is to
      enzymatically degrade PGN, thereby attenuating rather than initiating immune
      signaling. The appropriate term is peptidoglycan binding (GO:0042834) to capture
      the substrate recognition aspect, while the enzymatic function is captured by
      amidase activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is problematic. PGRP-LB is an amidase that degrades DAP-type
      peptidoglycan, which is characteristic of Gram-negative bacteria, not Gram-positive
      bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria typically have Lys-type peptidoglycan. The deep
      research explicitly states PGRP-LB functions "By degrading DAP-type PGN that
      activates the IMD pathway." The IMD pathway is primarily activated by DAP-type
      PGN from Gram-negative bacteria. PGRP-LB's role is actually in dampening immune
      responses to DAP-type PGN, not defending against Gram-positive bacteria.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      PGRP-LB degrades DAP-type peptidoglycan characteristic of Gram-negative bacteria,
      not Lys-type PGN from Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, PGRP-LB is a negative
      regulator of immune signaling, not a positive effector of defense responses. It
      dampens IMD pathway activation rather than promoting defense. A more accurate
      annotation would reflect its role in modulating responses to Gram-negative bacteria

      This annotation is appropriate for PGRP-LB. Unlike the non-catalytic PGRP-S1,
