2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PGRPLB' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PGRPLB** (gene ID: PGRPLB, UniProt: F5HMW5) in ANOGA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: PGRPLB (AGAP001212; UniProt F5HMW5) in Anopheles gambiae

Identity verification and gene/protein context
- Gene/protein identity: The Anopheles gambiae gene AGAP001212 encodes PGRP-LB (also written PGRPLB), a peptidoglycan-recognition protein (PGRP) belonging to the amidase-type PGRP family. In mosquito PGRP catalogs, AGAP001212 is explicitly listed as AgPGRP-LB, consistent with the UniProt F5HMW5 entry and with conserved PGRP/amidase domain motifs (Song et al., 2018; Rodgers et al., 2020) (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 14-16, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17). URL examples: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006899; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288.
- Organism: Anopheles gambiae s.l. (African malaria mosquito). The sources address Anopheles PGRPs and specifically reference AgPGRP-LB/AGAP001212 (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 14-16, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17).
- Domain/family alignment: Evidence indicates conserved PGRP domain and amidase residues characteristic of N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases in insect PGRP-LB proteins, consistent with UniProt domain annotations (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 14-16, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular class and reaction: PGRP-LB is an amidase-type PGRP that recognizes bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and enzymatically degrades it. Amidase PGRPs cleave the amide bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and L-alanine in the PGN stem peptide (N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase activity), thereby reducing immunostimulatory PGN ligands (Song et al., 2018; Rodgers et al., 2020) (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 9-11, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006899; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288.
- Pathway role: Negative regulator of IMD/REL2. By degrading DAP-type PGN that activates the IMD pathway, PGRP-LB dampens IMD/REL2 signaling and downstream antimicrobial peptide (AMP) responses, helping to prevent immune overactivation to commensal bacteria (Song et al., 2018; citations summarized in Rodgers et al., 2020) (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 2-4, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006899; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288.
- Biological context: In mosquitoes, PGRP-LB function is situated within gut/midgut immunity and microbiota homeostasis; Anopheles midgut studies integrating PGRP family functions link PGRP-LB to IMD/REL2 regulation and impacts on bacterial and Plasmodium interactions (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17, zakovic2025themajorrole pages 44-47).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024 sources)
- Midgut REL2 control and PGRP-LB: A recent preprint focusing on An. gambiae midgut immunity shows REL2/NF-κB signaling as a major regulator of midgut bacterial homeostasis after blood feeding and notes PGRP-LB among negative regulators in this axis. Loss of proper REL2 control induces dysbiosis and impacts parasite prevalence, placing PGRP-LB within the contemporary framework of midgut immune regulation (Zaković et al., bioRxiv, 2025-03-14; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.14.643338) (zakovic2025themajorrole pages 44-47). Although 2025, it frames 2023–2024 advances on mosquito midgut immune–microbiota–parasite interactions where PGRP-LB is a canonical negative regulator.
- Consolidation of PGRP-LB’s negative-regulatory role: Recent reviews of insect immunity and vector microbiota synthesize that amidase-type PGRPs, including PGRP-LB, serve as negative regulators of IMD signaling to preserve gut homeostasis. Our gathered evidence set references this consensus through earlier primary work consolidated in 2018–2020 mosquito studies, which remain the mechanistic foundation cited by later reviews (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17, song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 9-11).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Vector competence modulation via gut homeostasis: Work in malaria vectors demonstrates that PGRP-mediated control of microbiota and gut barrier integrity can alter Plasmodium infection outcomes. In Anopheles, PGRP family functions link IMD regulation, microbiota balance, and peritrophic matrix (PM) integrity; perturbation of these axes modulates vector competence. Song et al. (2018) showed in An. stephensi that perturbing a related PGRP (PGRP-LD) dysregulated microbiota, fragmented the PM, and increased Plasmodium infection, with restoration upon microbial recolonization, highlighting how PGRP-governed tolerance/homeostasis can be leveraged conceptually to reduce vectorial capacity (PLOS Pathogens, 2018-02-22; URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006899) (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 9-11, song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 17-18). While that study centers on PGRP-LD, the mechanism and cited literature position PGRP-LB as a conserved amidase negative regulator within the same IMD-centered gut homeostasis framework in Anopheles (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 2-4, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17).
- Targeting immune homeostasis pathways: Given PGRP-LB’s role in dampening IMD/REL2 signaling, strategies such as paratransgenesis or microbiota engineering could, in principle, modulate PGRP-LB function or expression to influence gut homeostasis and the mosquito’s permissiveness to Plasmodium, as inferred from the midgut IMD–microbiota literature cited above (zakovic2025themajorrole pages 44-47, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17). Direct field implementations specifically targeting AgPGRP-LB remain to be demonstrated.

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic consensus: The expert consensus distilled in primary and integrative works is that amidase-type PGRPs (PGRP-LB) function to degrade PGN and thereby limit IMD/REL2 pathway activation—a critical tolerance mechanism that protects commensals and prevents immunopathology. This negative regulation is fundamental to maintaining gut homeostasis across insects and is supported by conserved catalytic residues and phenotypes observed when these negative regulators are disrupted (Song et al., 2018; Rodgers et al., 2020) (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 9-11, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006899; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288.
- Placement in Anopheles gut immunity: Functional and transcriptomic analyses in Anopheles midgut immunity integrate PGRP-LB within IMD/REL2-controlled bacterial homeostasis, with consequences for dysbiosis and infection dynamics; this aligns with the broader view that PGRP-LB is a canonical negative regulator of REL2-driven AMP expression in the mosquito gut (Zaković et al., 2025 preprint; Rodgers et al., 2020) (zakovic2025themajorrole pages 44-47, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.14.643338; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103288.

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- PGRP negative regulation and midgut outcomes: Song et al. (2018) in An. stephensi reported that knockdown of PGRP-LD reduced gut microbiota abundance, fragmented the peritrophic matrix, and increased Plasmodium berghei oocyst infection; antibiotic elimination of microbiota eliminated the PM and increased vector competence, which could be reversed by recolonization with Enterobacter sp. (PLOS Pathogens, 2018-02-22; URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006899) (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 9-11). These quantitative outcomes (reported as significant changes in microbiota levels, PM integrity scores, and parasite prevalence) illustrate the magnitude by which PGRP-governed tolerance mechanisms can shift infection outcomes in mosquitoes, and they motivate analogous expectations for PGRP-LB’s role as an amidase negative regulator in Anopheles midgut (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 17-18, song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 2-4).
- REL2-driven homeostasis and dysbiosis: Recent An. gambiae midgut analyses show that REL2 loss causes Serratia overgrowth and lethality post-blood meal and reshapes Plasmodium prevalence, highlighting the sensitivity of vector competence to IMD/REL2-regulated homeostasis. PGRP-LB is cited among negative regulators modulating this axis (bioRxiv, 2025-03-14; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.14.643338) (zakovic2025themajorrole pages 44-47).

Primary function, substrates, and localization summary for AgPGRP-LB (AGAP001212)
- Enzymatic reaction and specificity: AgPGRP-LB is an amidase-type PGRP predicted to catalyze N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine hydrolysis within bacterial PGN, thereby inactivating/fragmenting immunostimulatory DAP-type PGN that would otherwise activate IMD/REL2 signaling (Song et al., 2018; Rodgers et al., 2020) (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 9-11, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17).
- Biological process and pathway: Negative regulation of the IMD/REL2 pathway to maintain gut immune homeostasis and prevent excessive AMP responses to commensals (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 2-4, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17).
- Localization and site of action: Midgut/gut immunity context in Anopheles, acting at the host–microbe interface where PGN is encountered; within recent Anopheles midgut studies, PGRP-LB is discussed alongside REL2-mediated bacterial homeostasis after blood feeding, indicating gut/midgut functional localization (zakovic2025themajorrole pages 44-47, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17).
- Implications: By tuning IMD/REL2 signaling via PGN degradation, PGRP-LB contributes to commensal tolerance, microbiota structure, and barrier function (PM integrity indirectly), with downstream effects on susceptibility to Plasmodium infection and thus vector competence (song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 9-11, rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17).

Limitations and knowledge gaps
- Direct biochemical assays in Anopheles for AgPGRP-LB’s enzymatic kinetics and in vivo substrate range remain limited in the retrieved sources; current understanding leverages strong orthology, conserved catalytic residues, and functional parallels from Drosophila and other insects, supported by mosquito midgut immunity studies (rodgers2020functionalanalysisof pages 12-17, song2018pgrpldmediatesa. pages 9-11).
