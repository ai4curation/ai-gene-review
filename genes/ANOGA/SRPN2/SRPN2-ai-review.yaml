description: >-
  SRPN2 (Serpin-2) is a secreted serine protease inhibitor that functions as a key negative regulator
  of the melanization defense response in Anopheles gambiae. It acts in the hemolymph to inhibit
  CLIP-domain serine proteases (CLIPB9, CLIPB10, CLIPB4) that would otherwise activate prophenoloxidase,
  thereby preventing excessive melanization. SRPN2 knockdown causes spontaneous melanotic pseudotumors,
  shortened lifespan, and enhanced killing of Plasmodium parasites through ookinete lysis and melanization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SRPN2 is a well-characterized serpin that directly inhibits CLIP-domain serine proteases including
      CLIPB9, CLIPB10, and CLIPB4. The IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference is strongly supported
      by multiple direct experimental studies demonstrating serine protease inhibitor activity [PMID:20953892,
      PMID:25525260, PMID:33520733].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This molecular function annotation is the core enzymatic activity of SRPN2. Biochemical studies
      have demonstrated that SRPN2 forms covalent, SDS-stable inhibitory complexes with its target proteases
      (CLIPB9, CLIPB10) with stoichiometry consistent with classic serpin inhibition mechanism
      [PMID:25525260, PMID:33520733]. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically appropriate given serpin
      family conservation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SRPN2 regulates the melanization arm of the innate immune response by inhibiting proteases that
      activate prophenoloxidase. However, a more specific term exists (GO:0035009 negative regulation
      of melanization defense response) that precisely captures SRPN2's function [PMID:16113656, PMID:20953892].
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While technically accurate that SRPN2 is involved in regulation of immune response, this term is
      too broad. SRPN2 specifically negatively regulates the melanization defense response, not immune
      responses generally. The more specific term GO:0035009 is already annotated and better represents
      the biological function.

      This annotation is problematic. SRPN2 actually FACILITATES parasite survival by

      SRPN2 is a classic inhibitory serpin that forms covalent, SDS-stable complexes with target
      serine proteases including CLIPB9, CLIPB10, and CLIPB4. The inhibition involves the reactive
      center loop trapping the protease in an inactive complex. SRPN2 is the primary negative regulator
      of the melanization cascade in A. gambiae, preventing uncontrolled melanization that would
      otherwise cause melanotic pseudotumors and shortened lifespan.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      Are there additional CLIPB proteases that are SRPN2 targets? The incomplete rescue of
      SRPN2-knockdown phenotype by single CLIPB knockdowns suggests additional targets.
  - question: >-
      What is the physiological role of the partial hinge insertion in SRPN2? The structural
      studies suggest it may represent a trade-off between RCL accessibility and inhibitory
      efficiency.
  - question: >-
      How does SRPN2 expression and activity change during Plasmodium infection to permit
      localized melanization while preventing systemic pathology?
