### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q7QIJ8
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Serine protease inhibitor 2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:19394412}; Short=Serpin 2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:19394412}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SRPN2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:19394412}; Synonyms=1270169; ORFNames=AgaP_AGAP006911 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:EAA04043.4};
- **Organism (full):** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the serpin family.
- **Key Domains:** Serpin_CS. (IPR023795); Serpin_dom. (IPR023796); Serpin_fam. (IPR000215); Serpin_sf. (IPR036186); Serpin_sf_1. (IPR042178)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SRPN2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Anopheles gambiae (African malaria mosquito).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SRPN2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SRPN2** (gene ID: SRPN2, UniProt: Q7QIJ8) in ANOGA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status
- Identity verification: Completed. Target is Anopheles gambiae serpin SRPN2 (UniProt Q7QIJ8; AGAP006911), a secreted serine protease inhibitor in the serpin superfamily that regulates melanization. Domains and serpin fold match UniProt and literature; no conflicting gene symbol usage detected (an2011crystalstructureof pages 1-2, michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 1-2).

Research report: SRPN2 (Anopheles gambiae serpin-2) — functional annotation and current understanding

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Protein identity and family: SRPN2 is a secreted serine protease inhibitor (serpin) from Anopheles gambiae that adopts the canonical serpin fold (three β-sheets, multiple α-helices) with an exposed reactive center loop (RCL) used to “suicide” inhibit target serine proteases via formation of SDS-stable complexes (Proteins: Structure, Jun 2011; https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.23002) (an2011crystalstructureof pages 1-2).
- Primary biological role: SRPN2 is a principal negative regulator of the insect melanization response by suppressing the prophenoloxidase (proPO) activation cascade in mosquito hemolymph. RNAi-mediated depletion induces spontaneous melanotic tumors, elevated melanin deposition, and reduced mosquito lifespan (EMBO Reports, Sep 2005; https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.embor.7400478) (michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 1-2, michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 2-3). A 2013 expert review consolidated SRPN2 as the only mosquito serpin with a defined molecular function at the time: inhibiting proPO-activating proteases to restrain melanization (Journal of Insect Physiology, Feb 2013; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.08.015) (gulley2013therolesof pages 10-11, gulley2013therolesof pages 8-10).
- Biochemical mechanism and substrates: SRPN2 forms covalent, SDS-stable inhibitory complexes with clip-domain serine proteases that act in proPO activation. Direct targets established to date include CLIPB9 and CLIPB10, both proPO-activating proteases (PAPs) in A. gambiae (Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, Jan 2021; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.585986; Journal of Insect Physiology, Feb 2013; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.08.015) (zhang2021clipb10isa pages 1-2, gulley2013therolesof pages 8-10).
- Subcellular localization: SRPN2 is an extracellular, hemolymph serpin; hemolymph depletion and systemic RNAi phenotypes indicate its function in the circulating immune milieu rather than intracellular compartments (Proteins: Structure, Jun 2011; EMBO Reports, Sep 2005) (an2011crystalstructureof pages 1-2, michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 1-2).

2) Molecular function, pathway placement, and localization details
- Negative regulator of melanization/PPO activation: Early functional genetics showed SRPN2 knockdown causes widespread melanotic masses beginning 2 days post-dsRNA (100% by day 4), with a threefold decrease in survival by day 10. Mechanistically, SRPN2 restrains PPAE/PAP activities to prevent excessive phenoloxidase activation and toxic quinone intermediates (EMBO Reports, Sep 2005; https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.embor.7400478) (michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 2-3, michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 1-2).
- Direct inhibitory targets and stoichiometry: Recombinant SRPN2 inhibits activated CLIPB10 in vitro with an inhibition stoichiometry of ~1.89:1 and forms an SDS-stable SRPN2–CLIPB10 complex, consistent with classic serpin inhibition. Genetic epistasis shows CLIPB10 knockdown partially reverses SRPN2-knockdown melanotic tumor formation, supporting CLIPB10 as an in vivo target. SRPN2 also forms an inhibitory complex with CLIPB9 and blocks its amidase activity; CLIPB9 is a PAP that activates proPO (Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, Jan 2021; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.585986; Journal of Insect Physiology, Feb 2013; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.08.015) (zhang2021clipb10isa pages 1-2, gulley2013therolesof pages 8-10).
- Placement in the complement-like hierarchy: Complement-like factor TEP1 acts upstream to enable activation of a non-catalytic clip-domain serine protease homolog (cSPH) module consisting hierarchically of SPCLIP1 → CLIPA8 → CLIPA28. SRPN2 knockdown enhances cleavage/activation of cSPHs (e.g., CLIPA8/CLIPA28/CLIPA14), indicating SRPN2 restricts proteases that activate the cSPH module downstream of TEP1. Recent 2024 work maps branching among catalytic CLIPs, with convergence on terminal PAPs including CLIPB10, and highlights that SRPN2-kd melanotic tumor phenotypes reflect unrestrained hemolymph PO activity within this architecture (bioRxiv, Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.13.548954; 2019 thesis framework) (saab2024insightintothe pages 1-4, moussawi2019functionalandmolecular pages 90-94, moussawi2019functionalandmolecularb pages 90-94).
- Localization and secretion: Structural and biochemical characterization identify SRPN2 as a native, extracellular/hemolymph serpin. The crystal structure (1.75 Å) shows a canonical serpin fold with the N-terminal hinge of the RCL partially inserted into β-sheet A—a feature proposed to modulate RCL accessibility and possibly regulation; in contrast to mammalian antithrombin, glycosaminoglycan (heparin) enhancement was not supported for SRPN2 (Proteins: Structure, Jun 2011; Journal of Insect Physiology, Feb 2013) (an2011crystalstructureof pages 1-2, gulley2013therolesof pages 8-10).

3) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- Cascade architecture and branching: A 2024 integrative genetic/biochemical study refined the melanization cascade hierarchy in A. gambiae, indicating branching downstream of upstream cSPs and convergence on terminal PAPs such as CLIPB10; it situates SRPN2-kd tumor phenotypes within this architecture and emphasizes bidirectional cSP–cSPH interactions for amplification. It also integrates three experimental paradigms for assessing melanization: P. berghei ookinete melanization (in CTL4-kd), SRPN2-kd tumors, and bacterial challenge–induced melanotic excreta (bioRxiv, Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.13.548954) (saab2024insightintothe pages 1-4).
- Methodological advances: A 2023 zone-of-inhibition assay enables medium-throughput assessment of hemolymph antimicrobial activity and the contribution of Toll pathway components and AMPs in A. gambiae hemolymph, facilitating standardized immune phenotyping that can be integrated with melanization studies (Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2023.891577) (moussawi2019functionalandmolecular pages 90-94) (moussawi2019functionalandmolecular pages 90-94) (saab2024insightintothe pages 1-4).

4) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Transmission-blocking biology: SRPN2 facilitates parasite survival during midgut traversal by restraining melanization; SRPN2 knockdown markedly reduces oocyst burden via increased ookinete lysis and melanization, highlighting SRPN2 and its targets as candidates for transmission-blocking strategies (EMBO Reports, Sep 2005; https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.embor.7400478) (michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 3-4, michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 2-3, michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 1-2).
- Insecticide or genetic control target: Structural work emphasized SRPN2 as a potential novel insecticide target given its central role in hemolymph homeostasis and lifespan; excess melanization due to SRPN2 loss reduces longevity, suggesting that targeted perturbation may decrease vector fitness (Proteins: Structure, Jun 2011; https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.23002) (an2011crystalstructureof pages 1-2).
- Epistasis-guided targeting within the cascade: The identification of direct targets (CLIPB9, CLIPB10) and their genetic interactions with SRPN2 provides specific nodes where interventions could modulate melanization strength without catastrophic host toxicity (Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, Jan 2021; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.585986) (zhang2021clipb10isa pages 1-2).

5) Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- 2013 review synthesis: Gulley, Zhang, and Michel emphasized SRPN2 as the best-characterized mosquito serpin with a defined molecular target (CLIPB9) and a clear role in restraining melanization; they highlighted that SRPN2 depletion produces systemic melanotic pathology and impacts parasite outcomes (Journal of Insect Physiology, Feb 2013; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.08.015) (gulley2013therolesof pages 10-11, gulley2013therolesof pages 8-10).
- 2024 cascade perspective: The 2024 preprint proposes a refined hierarchy with cSPH modules upstream and multiple catalytic CLIPs providing redundancy and branching; it frames SRPN2’s negative regulation as a key brake on pathway amplification, consistent with the tumor phenotype on SRPN2 loss (bioRxiv, Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.13.548954) (saab2024insightintothe pages 1-4).

6) Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- SRPN2 RNAi phenotype kinetics and survival: Melanotic masses are evident by day 2 post-dsRNA, reaching 100% by day 4; survival is reduced approximately threefold by day 10 relative to controls (EMBO Reports, Sep 2005) (michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 2-3, michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 1-2).
- Transmission impact: In SRPN2 knockdowns, infection prevalence decreased by ~55% and oocyst intensity dropped by ~97% at 7 days post-infection with P. berghei (GFP-CON strain), driven by increased ookinete lysis and melanization (EMBO Reports, Sep 2005; https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.embor.7400478) (michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 2-3, michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 1-2).
- Biochemical inhibition: SRPN2 inhibits activated CLIPB10 with an approximate stoichiometry of 1.89:1, forming an SDS-stable complex; SRPN2 also forms a covalent complex with CLIPB9 and inhibits its amidase activity (Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, Jan 2021; Journal of Insect Physiology, Feb 2013) (zhang2021clipb10isa pages 1-2, gulley2013therolesof pages 8-10).

7) Open questions and current limitations
- Identification of the full set of SRPN2 targets: While CLIPB9 and CLIPB10 are validated targets, SRPN2 knockdown phenotypes are only partially rescued by single CLIPB knockdowns, implying additional targets in the cascade (Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, Jan 2021; Journal of Insect Physiology, Feb 2013) (zhang2021clipb10isa pages 1-2, gulley2013therolesof pages 8-10).
- Upstream cleavers of cSPHs: The specific catalytic CLIPs that activate the core cSPH module (SPCLIP1–CLIPA8–CLIPA28) remain to be conclusively identified; redundancy and branching complicate mapping (bioRxiv, Jul 2024) (saab2024insightintothe pages 1-4).

Conclusion
SRPN2 (Q7QIJ8) is a hemolymph serpin that is essential for maintaining homeostatic control of the melanization cascade in A. gambiae. It directly inhibits terminal proPO-activating proteases (CLIPB9 and CLIPB10) and functions within a hierarchy where complement-like TEP1 and a cSPH module (SPCLIP1–CLIPA8–CLIPA28) operate upstream. SRPN2 loss unleashes PO activity, causing melanotic tumors, shortened lifespan, and strong anti-Plasmodium effects via ookinete lysis and melanization. Recent work in 2023–2024 refines the branching architecture and provides methodological tools to better interrogate hemolymph immunity, underscoring SRPN2 as a strategic node for vector control and transmission-blocking interventions (an2011crystalstructureof pages 1-2, michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 1-2, michel2005anophelesgambiaesrpn2 pages 2-3, gulley2013therolesof pages 8-10, zhang2021clipb10isa pages 1-2, saab2024insightintothe pages 1-4).
