description: >-
  TOLL9 (AGAP006974) encodes a single-pass type I transmembrane receptor of the Toll-like receptor
  family in Anopheles gambiae. The protein contains an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR)
  domain for ligand recognition, a transmembrane segment, and an intracellular TIR (Toll/IL-1
  receptor) domain for signal transduction. As a Toll receptor, TOLL9 functions in innate immunity
  by signaling through the conserved Myd88-Tube-Pelle-Cactus-Rel1 pathway upon engagement by
  processed Spaetzle cytokines. Comparative phylogenetic analyses place TOLL9 within a conserved
  subfamily across mosquitoes, with ectodomain divergence suggesting potential species-specific
  ligand recognition while preserving TIR-based signaling capacity. While direct experimental
  data specific to An. gambiae TOLL9 are limited, functional studies in Anopheles spp. demonstrate
  that Toll pathway activation (Rel1-dependent) reduces Plasmodium infection and regulates
  antimicrobial effector responses, supporting a role for TOLL9 in anti-pathogen immunity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation infers inflammatory response from phylogenetic analysis (IBA). However,
      insects do not have an inflammatory response in the classical vertebrate sense - they
      lack the adaptive immune components and tissue responses characteristic of inflammation.
      Insect Toll signaling participates in innate immune defense but through different
      mechanisms including antimicrobial peptide production, melanization, and hemocyte
      responses (Rhodes 2018, Saab et al. 2025). The term inflammatory response
      (GO:0006954) is defined for vertebrate-type inflammation and represents a
      misapplication when transferred to insects.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Inflammatory response is a vertebrate-specific term that does not accurately describe
      insect immune function. Insects lack the tissue pathology, vascular changes, and
      adaptive immune cell infiltration that define inflammation. The Toll pathway in
      mosquitoes instead mediates innate immune signaling leading to antimicrobial peptide
      production and complement-like responses. This IBA annotation likely resulted from
      automatic phylogenetic inference from vertebrate TLRs without considering the
      fundamental differences between vertebrate and insect immunity. A more appropriate
      annotation would be to the innate immune response or Toll signaling pathway terms.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      Signal transduction is a valid annotation for TOLL9, as Toll receptors transduce
      extracellular ligand binding signals to intracellular effectors. The IBA annotation
      is well-supported by phylogenetic conservation of the TIR domain signaling module
      across the Toll receptor family (Rhodes 2018). However, this term is quite general
      and there exists a more specific term - GO:0008063 (Toll signaling pathway) - that
      captures the precise signaling mechanism of this receptor family.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While signal transduction is technically correct, the more specific term GO:0008063
      (Toll signaling pathway) should be used instead, as it precisely describes the
      signaling mechanism employed by TOLL9. The Toll signaling pathway term is defined
      as "The series of molecular signals initiated by an extracellular ligand binding
      to the receptor Toll on the surface of a target cell, and ending with the regulation
      of a downstream cellular process, e.g. transcription." This exactly matches the
      characterized function of TOLL9 as a Toll receptor that signals via Myd88-Tube-Pelle-Cactus-Rel1.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      Signaling receptor activity is an appropriate molecular function annotation for TOLL9.
      The protein has a canonical Toll receptor architecture with extracellular LRRs for
      ligand binding and an intracellular TIR domain for signal transduction (UniProt,
      Rhodes 2018). The IBA evidence from phylogenetic analysis is well-supported. However,
      a more specific term exists - GO:0038187 (pattern recognition receptor activity) -
      that better describes the function of Toll family receptors in recognizing
      pathogen-associated or danger-associated molecular patterns.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While signaling receptor activity is correct, TOLL9 functions specifically as a
      pattern recognition receptor. The term GO:0038187 (pattern recognition receptor
      activity), defined as "Combining with a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP),
      a structure conserved among microbial species to initiate an innate immune response",
      more precisely describes the molecular function. Toll receptors recognize processed
      Spaetzle cytokines which are activated in response to pathogen recognition, placing
      them functionally within the PRR system of insects.

      Plasma membrane localization is well-supported for TOLL9. The protein has a
      predicted signal peptide, a transmembrane helix (positions 607-631 per UniProt/Phobius),
      and the canonical type I transmembrane topology expected for Toll receptors. The
      extracellular LRR domain faces the extracellular space for ligand binding, while

      consistent with both the predicted topology and the known localization of Toll
      receptor family members.

      This IEA annotation is derived from UniProt keyword mapping (Immunity keyword KW-0391).
      Immune system process is a high-level term that is technically correct but very
      general. The more specific child term GO:0045087 (innate immune response) is also
      annotated and is more informative. Retaining both is acceptable as they represent
      different levels of specificity in the ontology hierarchy.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While this is a general term, it accurately reflects that TOLL9 functions in
      immunity. The UniProt keywords "Immunity" and "Innate immunity" are appropriate
      for a Toll receptor, and this IEA annotation correctly captures the immune
      function. Since the more specific GO:0045087 (innate immune response) is also
      present, this broader term provides appropriate hierarchical coverage and is
      acceptable to retain.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation is derived from InterPro mapping of the TIR domain (IPR000157).
      The TIR domain is a protein-protein interaction module that mediates signal
      transduction in Toll receptors by recruiting adapter proteins like Myd88. The
      annotation is appropriate given the presence of this domain. However, as with the
      IBA annotation for the same term, a more specific Toll signaling pathway term
      would be preferable.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While this annotation correctly reflects that the TIR domain enables signal transduction
      function, the more specific term GO:0008063 (Toll signaling pathway) should be used

      This IEA annotation derives from UniProt subcellular location vocabulary mapping.
      The term 'membrane' (GO:0016020) is very general and the more specific term
      'plasma membrane' (GO:0005886) is already annotated via IBA evidence. However,
      this IEA annotation is not incorrect - TOLL9 is indeed a membrane protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While this is a more general term than the plasma membrane annotation, it is
      accurate. UniProt predicts TOLL9 as a "Single-pass type I membrane protein"
      based on Phobius transmembrane prediction. The annotation from subcellular
      location vocabulary mapping is valid. Having both the general (membrane, IEA)
      and specific (plasma membrane, IBA) terms is acceptable as they derive from
      different evidence methods.

      This IEA annotation derives from UniProt keyword mapping (Innate immunity KW-0399).
      Innate immune response is the most appropriate biological process term for TOLL9.
      Toll receptors are central to insect innate immunity, signaling through the
      Myd88-Tube-Pelle-Cactus-Rel1 cascade to induce antimicrobial peptides and
      complement-like effectors. Recent functional studies in Anopheles demonstrate
      that Toll pathway activation reduces Plasmodium infection (Liu et al. 2024).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the core biological process annotation for TOLL9. Toll receptors are
      fundamental components of insect innate immunity. The annotation is well-supported
      by: (1) the UniProt "Innate immunity" keyword, (2) membership in the Toll-like
      receptor family, (3) presence of TIR domain for immune signaling, and (4)
      functional evidence from Anopheles Toll pathway studies showing anti-Plasmodium
