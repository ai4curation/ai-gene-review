3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'TOLL9' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **TOLL9** (gene ID: TOLL9, UniProt: Q5TWL7) in ANOGA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and status
- Identity verification (completed): The target is TOLL9 from Anopheles gambiae, UniProt Q5TWL7, annotated as a Toll-like receptor family protein with extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRR), a single-pass transmembrane segment, and an intracellular TIR domain. Comparative analyses of mosquito Toll/TLRs confirm this canonical architecture for the Toll family and place mosquito TOLL9 within a conserved TLR subfamily, consistent with the UniProt domain annotations and family assignment (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 109-113, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 100-109, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 122-127).
- Evidence gathering (completed): Recent primary and review literature on mosquito Toll signaling, with emphasis on 2023–2024 sources, was assembled; direct functional data specific to Anopheles gambiae TOLL9 (AGAP006974) remain scarce, so functional inferences are drawn from mosquito Toll/TLR comparative genomics and from recent functional work on Toll pathway activity in Anopheles spp. (liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 1-2, liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 8-9, zmarlak2024theanophelesleucinerich pages 1-2, zmarlak2024theanophelesleucinerich pages 10-12), together with comprehensive phylogenetic/architectural analyses of Toll receptors in anophelines (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 122-127, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 109-113, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 127-132, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 100-109).

Executive summary
- Gene/protein identity: TOLL9 (AGAP006974; UniProt Q5TWL7) encodes a single-pass type I membrane receptor of the Toll-like receptor family bearing an extracellular LRR domain architecture and an intracellular TIR domain. This is congruent with mosquito TLR/Toll architectures described across anophelines (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 109-113, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 122-127, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 127-132).
- Current understanding: Direct Anopheles gambiae TOLL9 functional data are limited. However, mosquito Toll pathway activation is a well-established anti-pathogen mechanism that reduces Plasmodium infection, with recent in vivo evidence in 2024 showing Rel1 (NF-κB) dependence in Anopheles stephensi; the conserved intracellular module (Myd88–Tube–Pelle–Cactus–Rel1) supports inference that An. gambiae TOLL9 signals into this pathway (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 109-113, liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 1-2, liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 8-9). Phylogenetic analyses highlight a conserved TOLL9 subfamily with species-specific duplications (TOLL9A/9B) and divergence of ectodomains that likely tunes ligand specificity while preserving TIR-based signaling (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 122-127, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 127-132).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Toll/TLR architecture and signaling: Toll receptors in insects are LRR-containing type I membrane proteins with an intracellular TIR domain. Canonical activation involves extracellular proteolytic activation of the cytokine Spätzle, receptor dimerization, and recruitment of Myd88, Tube, and Pelle. Pelle-mediated degradation of Cactus frees NF-κB factors (e.g., DIF/REL1) to drive immune gene transcription (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 100-109, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 31-35, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 109-113). In Drosophila, Toll-9 is a distinctive sccTLR; mosquitoes mostly encode mcc-type ectodomains but nevertheless share the same overall transmembrane/TIR architecture (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 109-113).
- Mosquito TOLL9 subfamily: Across mosquitoes, TOLL9 comprises a conserved subfamily. Some lineages possess two paralogs (TOLL9A and TOLL9B). In anophelines, duplications are reported in An. albimanus and An. darlingi, with TOLL9B sisters clustering with culicine TOLL9B and showing pronounced divergence in ectodomain LRR arrangement and low amino-acid identity versus TOLL9A, while TIR phylogenies place all within TOLL9 (suggesting conserved signaling, divergent recognition) (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 122-127, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 127-132).
- Pathway placement: Intracellular Toll pathway members show strong 1:1 orthology across anophelines; thus, any Toll receptor including TOLL9 is expected to localize to the plasma membrane and to signal via Myd88–Tube–Pelle–Cactus–Rel1 within the cytosol/nucleus, modulating antimicrobial and complement-like effector outputs (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 100-109, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 31-35, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 109-113).

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- Toll pathway activation reduces malaria parasite burden in vivo. In 2024, dihydroartemisinin exposure in An. stephensi increased transcription and protein expression of Toll pathway components (Tube, MyD88, Rel1) and anti-Plasmodium effectors (e.g., TEP1, LRIM1, APL1C); Rel1 knockdown abrogated the DHA-induced reduction in oocysts and sporozoites, functionally linking Toll signaling to decreased vector competence (Parasites & Vectors, Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-024-06497-x) (liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 1-2, liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 8-9).
- Pathogen recognition by secreted LRRs and complement-like killing. In 2024, APL1C (a secreted LRR protein) and LRIM1 were shown to directly bind P. berghei ookinetes (binding persists even after TEP1 depletion), and APL1C also bound sporozoites, limiting salivary gland invasion; these LRRs operate with the complement-like TEP1 system to kill parasites (PLOS Pathogens, Feb 14, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012008) (zmarlak2024theanophelesleucinerich pages 1-2, zmarlak2024theanophelesleucinerich pages 15-16, zmarlak2024theanophelesleucinerich pages 10-12). While these are soluble LRR proteins, their LRR-based recognition reinforces a model in which LRR architecture in the mosquito immune system mediates specific pathogen interactions that could, by analogy, be relevant to the specificity of TLR ectodomains such as TOLL9.
- Comparative Toll/TLR landscape in Anopheles. Prior comparative work mapped TLR repertoires across 20–21 mosquito genomes, establishing that TOLL6–TOLL11 are generally conserved with 1:1 orthology, whereas TOLL1/5 underwent multiple duplications in the gambiae complex; TOLL9 duplications and structural divergence of ectodomains highlight potential diversification of ligand recognition while TIR domains remain within the TOLL9 clade (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 122-127, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 127-132, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 100-109). These findings align with domain expectations for TOLL9 in An. gambiae and suggest species-specific tuning of ligand recognition at the ectodomain level.

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Vector control by immune pathway modulation. Manipulating mosquito Toll signaling can reduce parasite development. The 2024 in vivo study demonstrates that pharmacologic stimulation (dihydroartemisinin) increases Toll activity and reduces Plasmodium oocyst and sporozoite numbers in Anopheles, with Rel1 required for the effect, suggesting feasibility of small-molecule or genetic strategies that boost Toll signaling to reduce transmission (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-024-06497-x) (liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 1-2, liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 8-9). Reviews of Anopheles–Plasmodium interactions emphasize Toll pathway roles in hemocyte recruitment, TEP1-dependent melanization, and oocyst control, supporting its translational relevance as a target for transmission-blocking strategies (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012965) (saab2025advancesinthe pages 10-12).
- Systems perspective for effector orientation. The discovery that secreted LRRs APL1C/LRIM1 directly bind parasites and guide TEP1 highlights opportunities to exploit recognition–effector coupling; these principles may inform design of engineered recognition molecules or induction schemes that mobilize complement-like responses in vectors (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012008) (zmarlak2024theanophelesleucinerich pages 1-2, zmarlak2024theanophelesleucinerich pages 15-16, zmarlak2024theanophelesleucinerich pages 10-12).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Authoritative reviews synthesize that the Toll pathway is a central anti-pathogen axis in mosquitoes, coordinating antimicrobial peptides, complement-like factors, melanization, and hemocyte functions. The intracellular signaling module is highly conserved, supporting extrapolation from one anopheline to another, although extracellular recognition and protease cascades can be lineage-specific (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 31-35, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 109-113). Recent reviews of Anopheles–Plasmodium interactions reiterate Toll’s role in limiting parasite stages and identify Toll activation as a promising avenue for transmission-blocking strategies (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012965) (saab2025advancesinthe pages 10-12). A 2023 review on arbovirus recognition situates Toll family members (including insect Toll-9 examples) among mosquito PRRs, evidencing diversified recognition and pathway uses across viruses and parasites (https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13071159) (prince2023recognitionofarboviruses pages 14-15).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- In vivo An. stephensi challenge experiments showed that DHA exposure significantly reduced P. yoelii oocyst and sporozoite numbers; the protective effect was lost upon Rel1 knockdown, mechanistically implicating Toll signaling. This provides functional, quantitative evidence that activating Toll signaling reduces parasite burden in mosquitoes (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-024-06497-x) (liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 1-2, liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 8-9). Zmarlak et al. quantified APL1C binding frequencies to P. berghei ookinetes and demonstrated increased infection prevalence/intensity upon APL1C silencing, quantifying the contribution of LRR recognition to parasite control (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012008) (zmarlak2024theanophelesleucinerich pages 10-12).

Function, localization, and pathway role of An. gambiae TOLL9 (AGAP006974; Q5TWL7)
- Subcellular localization and domain composition: By family/domain conservation, TOLL9 is a plasma-membrane receptor with extracellular LRRs and an intracellular TIR domain. This architecture is shared across mosquito Toll receptors and specifically within TOLL9 orthologs, with ectodomain LRR arrangements that can vary between paralogs but preserved TIR signaling modules (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 109-113, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 122-127, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 127-132).
- Primary molecular role: As a Toll receptor, TOLL9 is expected to function as a signal-transducing PRR system: upon ligand engagement (likely via processed Spätzle family cytokines; insects can display multi-Spätzle/Toll pairing), it recruits Myd88–Tube–Pelle, leading to Cactus degradation and nuclear Rel1 activation, inducing effectors such as antimicrobial peptides, complement-like factors (e.g., TEP1), and regulators of melanization/hemocyte responses (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 100-109, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 31-35, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 109-113). Given the divergence documented in TOLL9 ectodomains among mosquitoes, An. gambiae TOLL9 may have distinct ligand affinities compared with culicine or Nyssorhynchus TOLL9 paralogs (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 122-127, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 127-132).
- Pathway integration in Anopheles immunity: Strong experimental evidence in Anopheles spp. shows that Toll pathway activation (Rel1-dependent) reduces Plasmodium infection and shapes hemocyte/complement-like effector responses; thus, An. gambiae TOLL9 likely contributes as one of several Toll receptors that detect endogenous cytokines (Spätzle) induced by infection/injury and trigger Rel1-dependent anti-Plasmodium programs (liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 1-2, liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 8-9, saab2025advancesinthe pages 10-12). While secreted LRRs (APL1C/LRIM1) provide direct parasite recognition and orient TEP1 deposition, Toll receptors provide transcriptional control of many of these effector systems, placing TOLL9 in the upstream signaling layer rather than as a direct opsonin (zmarlak2024theanophelesleucinerich pages 1-2, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 31-35).

Critical note on symbol ambiguity and evidence limits
- The symbol “TOLL9” is used in multiple insects and can denote paralog pairs (TOLL9A/9B) in some mosquitoes. Comparative analyses indicate that An. gambiae generally retains a single-copy TOLL9 within the conserved TOLL9 subfamily; however, direct functional experiments specifically tying AGAP006974 (TOLL9) to a defined ligand or phenotype in An. gambiae were not identified in the recent literature surveyed here. Therefore, functional roles are inferred from conserved domain architecture, canonical Toll signaling, and recent Anopheles Toll-pathway functional studies. All inferences are flagged as homology- and pathway-based until AGAP006974-specific experimental validation becomes available (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 122-127, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 127-132).

- Functional role (inferred): A signaling receptor upstream of Rel1-dependent transcriptional programs that mobilize antimicrobial peptides, complement-like TEP1/LRIM1/APL1C modules, and melanization/hemocyte responses; in concert with soluble LRR recognition, contributes to limiting Plasmodium development and transmission potential (liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 1-2, liu2024dihydroartemisininsuppressesthe pages 8-9, saab2025advancesinthe pages 10-12, zmarlak2024theanophelesleucinerich pages 1-2, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 31-35).
- Specificity and evolution: Ectodomain divergence within the TOLL9 family across mosquitoes suggests potential differences in ligand (Spätzle isoforms) or co-receptor interactions, warranting AGAP006974-focused ligand-binding and signaling assays in An. gambiae to define exact input specificity and physiological roles (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 122-127, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 127-132).
- Experimental gaps: No direct ligand, loss-of-function, or overexpression phenotypes specific to AGAP006974 were identified in recent literature. Priority experiments include CRISPR/Cas9 knockout or tissue-specific RNAi of AGAP006974 in An. gambiae with readouts of Rel1-dependent transcription, Plasmodium burden across life stages, and interactions with Spätzle isoforms and extracellular protease cascades (rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 100-109, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 31-35, rhodes2018tollsignalingimmune pages 109-113).
