description: Low-CO2-inducible protein 5, a chloroplast thylakoid-associated 
  phosphoprotein that is strongly induced under carbon-limiting conditions as 
  part of the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
  While its precise molecular function remains unknown, LCI5 undergoes 
  redox-dependent phosphorylation exclusively under low CO2 conditions and 
  likely plays a regulatory or structural role in optimizing photosynthetic 
  efficiency during carbon limitation.
