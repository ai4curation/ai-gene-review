  label: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
description: Low-CO2-inducible protein 5, a chloroplast thylakoid-associated phosphoprotein that is strongly induced under carbon-limiting conditions as part of the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. While its precise molecular function remains unknown, LCI5 undergoes redox-dependent phosphorylation exclusively under low CO2 conditions and likely plays a regulatory or structural role in optimizing photosynthetic efficiency during carbon limitation.
