## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P15505
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), mitochondrial {ECO:0000305}; EC=1.4.4.2 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1993704, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7440562, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7440563}; AltName: Full=Glycine cleavage system P protein; AltName: Full=Glycine decarboxylase {ECO:0000303|PubMed:1993704}; AltName: Full=Glycine dehydrogenase (aminomethyl-transferring); Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=GLDC {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P23378};
- **Organism (full):** Gallus gallus (Chicken).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the GcvP family. .
- **Key Domains:** ArAA_b-elim_lyase/Thr_aldolase. (IPR001597); GcvP. (IPR003437); GDC-P_C. (IPR049316); GDC-P_N. (IPR049315); GDC_P. (IPR020581)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GLDC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Gallus gallus (Chicken).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GLDC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GLDC** (gene ID: GLDC, UniProt: P15505) in CHICK.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Key concepts and definitions

- Molecular identity and localization: GLDC encodes the P-protein of the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system (GCS), a PLP-dependent enzyme (EC 1.4.4.2) localized to the mitochondrial matrix or inner-membrane-associated matrix face, functioning within a multienzyme complex comprising P (GLDC), H (GCSH; lipoyl carrier), T (AMT; aminomethyltransferase), and L (DLD; dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) proteins (https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7388; 2015; Nature Communications) (pai2015glycinedecarboxylasedeficiency pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.1002/jimd.12295; 2020; Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease) (leung2020regulationofglycine pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.625120; 2021; Frontiers in Genetics) (leung2021glycinecleavagesystem pages 1-2).
- Catalyzed reaction and stoichiometry: GLDC decarboxylates glycine to release CO2 and transfers the aminomethyl group onto the lipoylated H-protein as an aminomethyl-lipoate intermediate; the T-protein then transfers the one-carbon unit to tetrahydrofolate (THF) forming 5,10-methylene-THF while releasing NH3; the L-protein reoxidizes the dihydrolipoyl moiety using NAD+ to NADH, completing the catalytic cycle (https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7388; 2015) (pai2015glycinedecarboxylasedeficiency pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.14773; 2020; The Plant Journal) (wittmiss2020stoichiometryoftwo pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.625120; 2021) (leung2021glycinecleavagesystem pages 1-2).
- Pathway context: The GCS is a central source of mitochondrial one-carbon units that feed folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM), supplying 5,10-methylene-THF and downstream formate for nucleotide biosynthesis and methylation reactions (https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7388; 2015) (pai2015glycinedecarboxylasedeficiency pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.625120; 2021) (leung2021glycinecleavagesystem pages 1-2).
- Protein family and domains: GLDC belongs to the GcvP family of PLP-dependent enzymes and is organized into N- and C-terminal subdomains (GDC_P_N and GDC_P_C) that align with GCS mechanistic roles and the H-protein interaction surface (https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.14773; 2020) (wittmiss2020stoichiometryoftwo pages 1-2).

Mechanism and structural features of the GCS

- Lipoyl carrier dynamics: The lipoylated H-protein serves as a swinging arm that accepts the aminomethyl group from GLDC and delivers it to AMT; the reduced lipoyl moiety is then reoxidized by DLD using NAD+, yielding NADH (https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.14773; 2020) (wittmiss2020stoichiometryoftwo pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.625120; 2021) (leung2021glycinecleavagesystem pages 1-2).
- Lipoylation biogenesis and H–P interface: Lipoate is assembled on the H-protein in mitochondria; LIAS generates lipoyl-H from octanoyl-H, and LIPT1 transfers the lipoyl group to E2 subunits of dehydrogenase complexes. Structural mapping places the H-protein lipoyl loop above the GLDC active-site tunnel, rationalizing disease mechanisms from H-protein variants that destabilize the lipoyl arm or its interaction with GLDC (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddac246; 2023; Human Molecular Genetics) (arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 8-9), (arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 2-3).

Biological roles, phenotypes, and disease relevance

- Consequences of deficiency: Biallelic variants in GLDC or AMT cause classical nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), with elevated plasma and CSF glycine and increased CSF:plasma glycine ratio, neonatal encephalopathy, hypotonia, seizures, and high mortality; GLDC deficiency in mice additionally yields neural tube defects (NTDs), ventriculomegaly/hydrocephalus, and depletion of one-carbon–carrying folates, which are preventable by formate supplementation during gestation (https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7388; 2015) (pai2015glycinedecarboxylasedeficiency pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.1172/jci132360; 2020; Journal of Clinical Investigation) (pai2015glycinedecarboxylasedeficiency pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.1002/jimd.12295; 2020) (leung2020regulationofglycine pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.625120; 2021) (leung2021glycinecleavagesystem pages 1-2).
- Variant NKH and lipoylation defects: A minority of NKH-like cases arise from defective mitochondrial protein lipoylation (e.g., LIAS, BOLA3, GLRX5, NFU1), producing combined deficiencies of GCS with PDH and 2-KGDH and overlapping phenotypes (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddac246; 2023) (arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 2-3).
- Chicken-specific context: Direct Gallus gallus GLDC functional studies are limited, but GLDC’s annotation as mitochondrial GcvP (UniProt P15505) and the high evolutionary conservation of GCS composition/sequence across vertebrates support conserved function, reaction, and localization in chicken (pai2015glycinedecarboxylasedeficiency pages 1-2), (wittmiss2020stoichiometryoftwo pages 1-2), (leung2021glycinecleavagesystem pages 1-2).

Recent developments (2023–2024) and latest research

- Combined NKH and lipoate deficiency from GCSH variants (2023): A multicenter study identified biallelic GCSH variants causing combined NKH and lipoate deficiency, with mechanistic evidence of impaired H-protein stability, reduced H lipoylation, and downstream hypolipoylation of PDH/2-KGDH E2 subunits; functional assays in patient fibroblasts, COS7 cells, yeast, and purified proteins demonstrated variant-specific hypomorphic effects and clarified structural perturbations of the lipoyl loop and the H–P interface (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddac246; Oct 2023) (arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 16-16, arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 1-1, arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 9-10, arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 8-9, arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 1-2, arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 7-8, arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 11-12).
- Natural history and outcomes (2024): A Chinese cohort synthesis (n=20) described 85% neonatal and 15% infantile NKH presentations, frequent seizures, lethargy, hypotonia, apnea, and MRI/EEG abnormalities; 65% of cases carried GLDC variants and 35% AMT variants; nine of 18 patients with outcome data died (eight neonatally). The study argues MRI/EEG abnormalities better predict prognosis than initial CSF glycine/plasma measures and calls for standard diagnostic/therapeutic protocols (https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2024.1440883; Aug 2024; Frontiers in Neurology) (arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 1-1).
- Regulation of glycine metabolism and therapy proxies (pre-2023 mechanistic foundation): Mouse Gldc models show tissue-specific glycine and acylglycine accumulation and demonstrate that augmenting glycine conjugation (e.g., sodium benzoate or cinnamate) reduces plasma and tissue glycine, including in brain, although neurodevelopmental outcomes remain limited—informing current clinical practice (https://doi.org/10.1002/jimd.12295; 2020) (leung2020regulationofglycine pages 1-2).

Current applications and real-world implementations

- Diagnostic genetics: Targeted sequencing of GLDC and AMT is first-line in suspected NKH; absence of variants prompts evaluation of lipoylation pathway genes and biochemical lipoylation status, a practice reinforced by 2023 evidence of GCSH-linked combined phenotypes (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddac246; 2023) (arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 2-3, arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 1-2).
- Biomarker and imaging: Elevated CSF and plasma glycine and an increased CSF:plasma glycine ratio support diagnosis; MRI (e.g., white-matter abnormalities, corpus callosum dysplasia) and EEG (burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia) help prognosis and care planning (https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2024.1440883; 2024) (arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 1-1).
- Supportive therapies: Sodium benzoate remains standard to enhance glycine conjugation and reduce glycine levels; mechanistic mouse work shows cinnamate may provide similar biochemical benefits, guiding exploratory management strategies (https://doi.org/10.1002/jimd.12295; 2020) (leung2020regulationofglycine pages 1-2).
- Developmental prevention in models: Maternal formate supplementation rescues folate one-carbon deficits and prevents NTDs and hydrocephalus in GLDC-deficient mice, defining a pathogenesis rooted in one-carbon insufficiency rather than glycine excess (https://doi.org/10.1172/jci132360; 2020) (pai2015glycinedecarboxylasedeficiency pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses

- Mechanistic consensus: Authoritative studies position GLDC as a gatekeeper of mitochondrial one-carbon flux, with defects causing dual biochemical insults—glycine accumulation and one-carbon scarcity—manifesting in NKH and developmental anomalies; the lipoylation machinery and H-protein function are critical auxiliary determinants (https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7388; 2015) (pai2015glycinedecarboxylasedeficiency pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.625120; 2021) (leung2021glycinecleavagesystem pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddac246; 2023) (arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 2-3).
- Clinical perspective (2024): The multi-center Chinese experience emphasizes heterogeneity in presentation and outcomes and suggests neuroimaging and electrophysiology as prognostic tools beyond biochemical ratios, aligning care with precision diagnostics and counseling (https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2024.1440883; 2024) (arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 1-1).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies

- 2024 cohort (China): 17/20 (85%) neonatal; 3/20 (15%) infantile; GLDC variants in 13/20 (65%) and AMT variants in 7/20 (35%); nine deaths among 18 with outcomes, eight in the neonatal period (https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2024.1440883; 2024) (arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 1-1).
- Contribution of GLDC to classic NKH: Nearly 80% of classic NKH cases carry biallelic GLDC variants; a minority (~4%) of NKH-like cases arise from lipoylation pathway defects causing combined enzyme deficiencies (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddac246; 2023) (arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 2-3).

Verification of target identity and chicken specificity

- Gene/protein identity: The symbol GLDC correctly maps to glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), the GCS P-protein. UniProt P15505 corresponds to the Gallus gallus ortholog with a mitochondrial precursor signal and GcvP family domains; these are congruent with conserved mechanistic literature and cross-kingdom annotations (pai2015glycinedecarboxylasedeficiency pages 1-2), (wittmiss2020stoichiometryoftwo pages 1-2), (leung2021glycinecleavagesystem pages 1-2).
- Organism verification: The organism is Gallus gallus. No conflicting gene symbol usage was identified in the evidence set; where species-specific data are limited, we infer function from highly conserved GCS biochemistry and domain architecture (wittmiss2020stoichiometryoftwo pages 1-2), (pai2015glycinedecarboxylasedeficiency pages 1-2).

Notes on gaps and limitations

- Direct experimental studies on chicken GLDC biochemistry and physiology were not identified in the 2023–2024 literature; conclusions about Gallus gallus GLDC rely on conserved family/domain features and cross-species mechanistic work. Where organism-specific data are lacking, the mitochondrial localization, reaction chemistry, and role in one-carbon metabolism are strongly inferred from universally conserved GCS biology (pai2015glycinedecarboxylasedeficiency pages 1-2), (wittmiss2020stoichiometryoftwo pages 1-2), (leung2021glycinecleavagesystem pages 1-2).

Conclusion

GLDC (UniProt P15505) in Gallus gallus is the mitochondrial P-protein of the glycine cleavage system, catalyzing glycine decarboxylation and aminomethyl transfer to the lipoylated H-protein, thereby supplying one-carbon units to the folate cycle. The enzyme is part of a conserved multienzyme complex (P/H/T/L) whose function depends critically on lipoylation dynamics. Recent advances in 2023–2024 elucidate the role of H-protein in combined NKH and lipoate deficiency and refine clinical natural history, while foundational mouse studies define developmental pathogenesis and therapeutic rescue via formate. Chicken-specific primary studies remain limited, but conservation of domains, localization signals, and complex composition strongly supports equivalent function and pathway integration in chicken GLDC (pai2015glycinedecarboxylasedeficiency pages 1-2, wittmiss2020stoichiometryoftwo pages 1-2, leung2021glycinecleavagesystem pages 1-2, arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 2-3, arribascarreira2023pathogenicvariantsingcshencoding pages 1-1).
