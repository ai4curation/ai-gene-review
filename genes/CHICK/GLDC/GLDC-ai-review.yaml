description: >-
  GLDC encodes the P-protein of the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system (GCS),
  a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme (EC 1.4.4.2) that catalyzes the
  decarboxylation of glycine and transfers the aminomethyl moiety to the lipoylated
  H-protein (GCSH). The GCS is a multienzyme complex consisting of P (GLDC),
  H (GCSH), T (AMT), and L (DLD) proteins that functions in the mitochondrial matrix.
  GLDC provides one-carbon units to folate metabolism via 5,10-methylene-THF, linking
  glycine catabolism to nucleotide biosynthesis and methylation reactions. The chicken
  protein was extensively characterized in the seminal work by Hiraga and Kikuchi (1980).

      GLDC is established as a mitochondrial matrix protein. The IBA annotation is
      consistent with direct experimental evidence from chicken showing mitochondrial
      localization (PMID:7440562) and conserved across the GcvP family.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Mitochondrial localization is a core characteristic of GLDC. Hiraga & Kikuchi
      (1980) purified P-protein from chicken liver mitochondria. The deep research
      confirms "GCS is a mitochondrial (matrix/inner-membrane-associated) multienzyme
      complex" (file:CHICK/GLDC/GLDC-deep-research-falcon.md). The IBA is phylogenetically

      GLDC is a PLP-dependent enzyme with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate covalently bound
      to Lys-738 (Lys-35 in the phosphopyridoxyl peptide). This IBA annotation is
      well-supported by experimental evidence.

      PLP binding is a core mechanistic feature of GLDC required for glycine
      decarboxylation. Fujiwara et al. (1987) determined the amino acid sequence
      of the phosphopyridoxyl peptide and identified Lys as the PLP attachment site.
      Hiraga & Kikuchi (1980) showed the enzyme contains equimolar pyridoxal 5'-phosphate.

      This is the correct molecular function term for GLDC (EC 1.4.4.2). The enzyme
      decarboxylates glycine and transfers the aminomethyl moiety to lipoylated
      H-protein, releasing CO2.

      This is the definitive molecular function of GLDC. The reaction catalyzed is:
      lipoyl-H-protein + glycine + H+ = aminomethyl-lipoyl-H-protein + CO2
      (EC 1.4.4.2). Hiraga & Kikuchi (1980) demonstrated that P-protein could catalyze
      glycine decarboxylation with the product being methylamine.

  findings:
  - statement: GLDC purification and characterization as a homodimeric, PLP-dependent enzyme
    supporting_text: >-
      Glycine decarboxylase, tentatively called P-protein and considered a constituent
      of the glycine cleavage system, was purified to apparent homogeneity from
      chicken liver mitochondria. P-protein is a homodimer having a Mr = approximately
      200,000 and consisting of identical subunits with Mr = approximately 100,000.
      Each subunit appears to contain an equimolar pyridoxal 5'-phosphate
  - statement: Glycine binding and decarboxylation activity
    supporting_text: >-
      P-protein could bind glycine, showing a Kd of 33 mM for it, and could catalyze
      glycine decarboxylation even though the rate of decarboxylation catalyzed by
      P-protein alone was extremely low. The product of glycine decarboxylation was
      methylamine
  - statement: Stimulation by lipoic acid
    supporting_text: >-
      Both glycine decarboxylation and the glycine-CO2 exchange catalyzed by P-protein
      were stimulated 100-fold or more by the addition of lipoic acid, which is a
      functional group of H-protein.

  title: Deep research on GLDC function and glycine cleavage system
  findings:
  - statement: GLDC is the P-protein of the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system
    supporting_text: >-
      GLDC encodes the P-protein of the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system (GCS),
      a PLP-dependent enzyme (EC 1.4.4.2) localized to the mitochondrial matrix
  - statement: GCS complex composition and reaction mechanism
    supporting_text: >-
      GCS = P (GLDC: decarboxylase), H (GCSH: lipoyl carrier / shuttle), T (AMT:
      aminomethyltransferase), L (DLD: dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase). Glycine (substrate)
      is decarboxylated to CO2; the aminomethyl moiety is transferred to the lipoyl-H-protein

core_functions:
- description: >-
    GLDC is the P-protein of the glycine cleavage system, catalyzing the
    PLP-dependent decarboxylation of glycine and transfer of the aminomethyl
    moiety to lipoylated H-protein (GCSH), releasing CO2. This provides
    one-carbon units to folate metabolism.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    Why was GO:0047960 (glycine dehydrogenase activity) originally assigned
    to GLDC instead of GO:0004375? Was this a systematic curation error or
    confusion between the two enzymes?
  experts:
  - Hiraga K

suggested_experiments:
- hypothesis: >-
    The incorrect GO:0047960 annotations may have propagated to other species
    via ISS/IBA methods.
  description: >-
