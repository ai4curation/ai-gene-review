description: BT_2157 encodes a 3-keto-disaccharide hydrolase (EC 3.2.1.218), a key enzyme in the 3-ketoglycoside pathway exemplar as noted by the colleague. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of 3-keto-glycosides, including 3-keto-trehalose, as part of a unique metabolic pathway for processing dietary glucosinolates in the human gut microbiome. The enzyme is part of a gene cluster that enables B. thetaiotaomicron to metabolize plant-derived glucosinolates, converting them to bioactive isothiocyanates that have health-promoting effects. This 290-residue protein contains a signal peptide for membrane localization and represents a novel glycoside hydrolase family involved in gut microbiome-diet interactions.
