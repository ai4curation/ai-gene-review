SIR3 (Silent Information Regulator 3) - Comprehensive GO Annotation Curation
================================================================================

ORGANISM: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
UNIPROT ID: P06701
GENE SYMBOL: SIR3
REVIEW DATE: December 2025

================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Systematic curation and review of all 45 GO annotations for yeast SIR3,
with focus on distinguishing SIR3's structural role from the catalytic role
of its complex partner SIR2.

KEY PRINCIPLE: SIR3 is a structural protein providing nucleosome-binding
and complex assembly functions, NOT a catalytic enzyme.

================================================================================
CORE FUNCTIONAL MODEL
================================================================================

SIR3 Functions As:

1. NUCLEOSOME-BINDING PROTEIN
   - Binds histone H4 N-terminal tail
   - Interacts with H3K79
   - Creates nucleosome bridges in chromatin fiber

2. HOMODIMER
   - C-terminal winged helix domain mediates dimerization
   - Essential for complex stability and function

3. COMPLEX COMPONENT
   - Forms Sir2-3-4 silent chromatin complex
   - Recruits SIR2 deacetylase to target loci
   - Works with SIR4 for complex assembly

4. CHROMATIN STRUCTURE MODIFIER
   - Compacts chromatin fiber into condensed form
   - Maintains heterochromatin at mating-type loci, telomeres, rDNA
   - Represses transcription by creating inaccessible chromatin

5. ORIGIN REGULATOR
   - Directly localizes to euchromatic origins via nucleosome binding
   - Suppresses MCM loading and replication initiation
   - Acts independently of SIR2 catalytic function at origins

KEY DISTINCTION FROM SIR2:
  - SIR2: NAD-dependent histone deacetylase (catalytic)
  - SIR3: Nucleosome-binding structural protein (non-catalytic)

================================================================================
MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS
================================================================================

Mating-Type Silencing (HML, HMR):
  - SIR3 recruited via RAP1 at silencer elements
  - Forms complex with SIR2, SIR4
  - Nucleosome binding creates condensed chromatin
  - SIR2 deacetylates H4K16 within this structure
  - Result: Transcriptional repression

Telomeric Silencing:
  - SIR3 essential for telomeric heterochromatin
  - Mediates telomere tethering to nuclear periphery
  - Supports telomere homeostasis and clustering
  - Links to replicative lifespan control

rDNA Silencing:
  - SIR3 maintains silencing at repetitive rDNA origins
  - Redistributes to nucleolus in aged cells
  - Connected to yeast chronological lifespan

Euchromatic Origin Regulation:
  - SIR3 binds origin-adjacent nucleosomes broadly
  - Suppresses ~80% of euchromatic origins
  - Acts through nucleosome-level chromatin modification
  - Requires nucleosome H3K79 interaction surface

================================================================================
FALSE POSITIVE PATTERNS
================================================================================

IBA (Phylogenetic) Over-Predictions:
  - DNA replication initiation: Conflates suppression with participation
  - Origin binding: Mistakes nucleosome binding for origin recognition
  - Checkpoint signaling: No actual evidence

HDA (Homology) False Positives:
  - Mitochondrial localization: MS sample contamination artifacts

IMP Over-Interpretation:
  - NHEJ pathway: Indirect effects through telomere maintenance
  - mRNA decay: Indirect effects through global gene expression

IEA (Sequence) Validity:
  - Mostly accurate for DNA binding, chromatin binding
  - Transcription term needs modification to repression term

================================================================================
CURATION PRINCIPLES APPLIED
================================================================================

1. Structural vs. Catalytic Distinction
   - SIR3 is structural; SIR2 is catalytic
   - Annotations should reflect this difference

2. Direct vs. Indirect Functions  
   - SIR3 directly binds nucleosomes
   - SIR3 directly suppresses origins through chromatin
   - SIR3 does NOT directly repair DNA or degrade RNA

3. Specificity Over Generality
   - Avoid "protein binding" (too vague)
   - Use "nucleosome binding" and "identical protein binding"

4. Process vs. Product Distinction
   - Origin binding = ORC's role
   - Nucleosome binding = SIR3's role

5. Experimental Evidence Priority
   - EXP > IDA > IMP > IPI > NAS > IEA > IBA > HDA
   - Literature support required for all retained annotations

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For Future Annotation:
1. Maintain distinction between structural and catalytic roles
2. Use specific binding terms (nucleosome, histone) over generic
3. Use negative regulation terms for suppression functions
4. Verify all IBA annotations with literature evidence

For GO Ontology:
1. Expand chromatin structure formation terms (limited specificity)
2. Better distinguish origin recognition (ORC) from origin regulation
3. Add terms for nucleosome-level chromatin modification

For Community:
1. Use this review as model for SIR complex curation
2. Apply same principles to SIR2, SIR4 annotations
3. Consider cross-kingdom comparative curation
4. Validate computational annotations against biochemistry
