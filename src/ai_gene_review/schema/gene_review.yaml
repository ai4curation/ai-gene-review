description: Schema for gene curation
  Top level entity is a GeneReview, which is about a single gene (and its equivalent swiss-prot entry).
  It contains a high level summary of the gene, plus a review of all existing annotations.
  It also contains a list of core functions, which are GO-CAM-like annotons describing the core evolved
  functions of the gene.
