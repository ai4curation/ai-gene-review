# Readout → annotation rubric (ASSAY_TO_FUNCTION)

A curator-facing rubric for deciding what GO annotation a **convergent
phenotypic readout** licenses. Grounded in the publications-corpus mining (see
[`../ASSAY_TO_FUNCTION.md`](../ASSAY_TO_FUNCTION.md)); machine-readable form in
[`rubric.yaml`](rubric.yaml).

## The core rule

A readout that reports the **state of a process P** (ROS level, caspase
activity, UPR activation, ΔΨm, Ca²⁺, pH, viability…) measures a *downstream
consequence*, not the gene product's molecular activity. So a positive readout
after perturbing gene G licenses **at most**:

- aspect **BP** (or **CC** for organelle-health probes) — **never MF**;
- framing **"response to P" / "regulation of P"** — not a direct effector role;
- default **non-core**.

Promote to **core** only when *independent* evidence (genetics, biochemistry,
structure) places G in the **recognized machinery / sensor set** for P — not
merely as a perturbation that moves the needle.

This is what curators are already doing in the corpus: the same readout yields
`ACCEPT` for the machinery and `KEEP_AS_NON_CORE` / `MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED`
for genes acting indirectly.

## Decision procedure

```
Is the evidence a state/phenotype readout (not a molecular assay of G)?
│
├─ No  → ordinary evidence rules apply (MF/direct annotation may be fine).
│
└─ Yes → 1. Reject any MF term sourced from this readout.
              (Exception: a transcriptional reporter for a bona fide
               DNA-binding TF — MF TF-activity is legitimate.)
         2. Use a "response to P" / "regulation of P" BP term at the
            altitude the readout DIRECTLY reports — not a more distal or
            tissue-specific child.
         3. Is G in the recognized core machinery / sensor set for P?
              ├─ Yes → core annotation OK (ACCEPT).
              └─ No  → KEEP_AS_NON_CORE (or MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED if the
                       gene's real function clearly lies elsewhere).
```

| Membrane trafficking / endocytosis | BP, CC | MF | context | clathrin/adaptor/Rab/ESCRT machinery or the internalized receptor |
| Secretion / degranulation | BP | MF | non-core | SNARE/exocytic machinery or the regulated cargo's dedicated secretagogue |
| Metabolic flux (glucose/Seahorse) | BP | MF | non-core | glycolytic/OXPHOS enzyme or glucose transporter |
| DNA-damage foci (γH2AX/comet) | BP, CC | MF | context | DDR/repair machinery (ATM/ATR, BRCA, RAD51, 53BP1, MRN) |
| Senescence (SA-β-gal) | BP | MF | non-core | core senescence effector (p53/p21, p16-RB) |
| Wnt reporter (TOPFlash) | BP | MF | context | Wnt pathway component (ligand/receptor/destruction complex/TCF) |
| NF-κB reporter | BP | MF | context | NF-κB pathway component (RelA/IκB/IKK/TRAF) |
| Hypoxia reporter (HRE/HIF) | BP | MF | non-core | HIF subunit/PHD/VHL oxygen-sensing machinery |
| Notch reporter (RBP-J/CSL) | BP | MF | context | Notch receptor/ligand/CSL transcription complex |
| Hippo reporter (TEAD/GTIIC) | BP | MF | context | Hippo kinase cassette or YAP/TAZ/TEAD |

\* Ca²⁺-binding MF (EF-hand) can be justified by independent structural/binding
evidence, not by the imaging readout itself.

The pathway-reporter rows (Wnt/NF-κB/Notch/Hippo/hypoxia) are `context` rather
than `non-core` because, like a transcriptional reporter, the same readout
legitimately reports the *core* output of a bona fide pathway component (a
Frizzled receptor, RelA, a HIF subunit) — promote to core only for those, demote
for genes that merely perturb the reporter.

### The molecular contrast: rubidium (⁸⁶Rb⁺) flux

Not every ion readout is a convergent hub. **Rb⁺ flux** (⁸⁶Rb⁺ efflux/uptake, the
classic K⁺-channel/transporter assay using Rb⁺ as a K⁺ congener) sits at the
*molecular / low-convergence* end of the proximity axis: it is a near-direct
measure of the gene product's own transport activity, so — unlike Ca²⁺ imaging (a
second-messenger hub that licenses at most a BP term) — it **legitimately licenses
an MF channel-activity term** (`potassium channel activity`, GO:0005267). It is
the positive-control mirror image of the phenotypic hubs.

*Caveat (the same proximity logic in reverse):* Rb⁺ flux is direct only for the
**pore-forming channel**. If flux moves because an *upstream regulator, β-subunit,
or trafficking factor* was perturbed, the inference is exactly as indirect as the
hubs — BP-only, default non-core.

*Corpus note:* ⁸⁶Rb is detected in 33 cached papers but is almost never the cited
`original_reference_id` of a reviewed annotation (only 1, and it is not a K⁺
channel), so the corpus is currently under-powered to demonstrate the MF licensing
empirically. This re-illustrates the first-pass finding that MF annotations cite
structural/biochemical references, not functional-flux assays.

### Molecular MF-licensing controls (the positive-control set)

Where Rb⁺ flux was too niche, common molecular assays demonstrate the MF side of
the proximity axis directly. Aligned-annotation aspect (canonical join):
**ChIP/EMSA → MF 136**, in-vitro **kinase assay → MF 106**, **GTPase/GAP/GEF →
MF 55**, in-vitro **ubiquitination/E3 → MF 39** (+CC 24 for the ligase complexes),
**electrophysiology → MF 18**. These are the molecular mirror of the hubs: a
readout of the gene product's *own* activity (DNA binding, phosphotransfer, GTP
hydrolysis, ubiquitin transfer, ion conduction) legitimately licenses an MF term.
Pairings to keep in mind when curating:

- ChIP/EMSA (MF, direct DNA binding) ↔ transcriptional reporter (BP, pathway output)
- electrophysiology (MF, channel activity) ↔ Ca²⁺/Rb⁺ imaging-flux (BP, ion state)
- in-vitro kinase assay (MF) ↔ phospho-Western of a downstream substrate (BP, pathway state)

Same caveat as Rb⁺ flux: these are direct for the assayed protein; if the readout
moves because an *upstream regulator* was perturbed, the inference is indirect.

## Worked contrasts from the corpus

Each pair shows the **same readout** licensing a core annotation for the
machinery vs. an over-annotation for a gene acting indirectly:

- **Apoptosis:** `BCL2` → *negative regulation of apoptotic process* (ACCEPT)
  vs `Akt1` → *negative regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling* (NON_CORE).
- **Proliferation:** `CDK1` → *G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle* (ACCEPT)
  vs `ACTB` → *positive regulation of cell population proliferation* (OVER_ANNOTATED).
- **ROS:** `TP53` → *positive regulation of ROS metabolic process* (ACCEPT)
  vs `PEX10`/`PEX13` (peroxins) → *cellular response to ROS* (OVER_ANNOTATED).
- **UPR:** `ATF4` → *PERK-mediated UPR* (ACCEPT) vs `HSPA1A` → *ER UPR*
  (NON_CORE); and `IRE1` → *unfolded protein binding* **(MF, OVER_ANNOTATED)** —
  a textbook reporter-driven MF over-call.
- **Autophagy:** `AMBRA1` → *autophagosome assembly* (ACCEPT) vs `ABI2` →
  *mitophagy* (OVER_ANNOTATED).
- **Transcription (the MF exception):** `ATF2`/`ASCL1` → *DNA-binding
  transcription factor activity* (ACCEPT — genuine TFs) vs `AIP` →
  *transcription coactivator activity* (OVER_ANNOTATED).

Extended set (second-pass readout classes):

- **Cell migration / invasion:** `CLTC`-style adhesion/cytoskeletal machinery and
  guidance ligands whose *signature* is motility stay core — `CCL11`/eotaxin →
  *cell chemotaxis* and `PDGFA`/`PDGFB` → *cell migration / chemotaxis* are
  ACCEPT (these are already in `core_functions`: a chemokine's defining output is
  chemotaxis). Contrast `STAT3` → *positive regulation of cell migration* (a
  transcription factor; migration is a downstream transcriptional consequence,
  not in the motility machinery) — the genuine non-core/borderline case.
- **DNA-damage foci:** `BRCA1`/`BRCA2`/`CHD1`/`RAD18` → *double-strand break
  repair* / *DNA repair complex* (ACCEPT — DDR machinery) vs a gene that merely
  shows γH2AX foci after perturbation (non-core "response to DNA damage").
- **Endocytosis:** `CLTC` (clathrin) / `TFRC` (transferrin receptor) →
  *clathrin-dependent endocytosis* / *receptor-mediated endocytosis* (ACCEPT —
  the machinery and the internalized receptor) vs a cargo that is merely taken
  up (non-core).
- **Wnt reporter:** `CTNNB1`/`AXIN1`/`FZD7` → *canonical Wnt signaling pathway*
  (ACCEPT — pathway machinery) vs a gene that only shifts TOPFlash (non-core).
- **Senescence / NF-κB / hypoxia:** `TP53` → *cellular senescence*, `TRAF6` →
  *NF-κB signal transduction*, `ARNT`/HIF-1β → *response to hypoxia* are ACCEPT
  because the gene is the pathway's core effector/transducer — the reporter
  reports its own output.

## Caveat: dedicated signaling ligands (signature vs incidental)

The "phenotypic hub readout ⇒ non-core" rule, and the flagger's
`indirect_ligand` discriminator, **over-fire on dedicated cytokines and growth
factors**. For a gene whose entire biological purpose is to regulate a process
(VEGFA→endothelial proliferation; IL21→B-cell/Tfh responses), the regulated
process is *core* even though it is mechanistically downstream of receptor
signaling. "Cytokine activity" alone is nearly contentless, so the regulated
processes are the informative, identity-defining annotations.

The discriminating axis is therefore **signature vs incidental**, not
ligand-vs-not:

- **Signature** — the process the gene is known/named for, and that loss-of-
  function abolishes → keep core (VEGFA endothelial proliferation; IL21 germinal
  center / Tfh / B-cell responses).
- **Incidental / generic / tissue-specific-secondary / context-dependent** →
  demote (HMGB1→CXCR4 calcium; VEGFA→generic anti-apoptosis; IL21→T-cell
  proliferation is borderline and was deferred to expert review, issue #1418).

Mechanistic directness still matters for the *ligand vs receptor* distinction
(knockout *necessity* ≠ the ligand *directly* performing the process), but it
must not be applied so bluntly that a dedicated cytokine's signature outputs are
stripped to non-core.

## How this was derived

Across 722 thematically-aligned (annotation, source-paper-readout) pairs, the
GO aspect of hub-readout annotations is overwhelmingly BP/CC with ~zero MF
(transcriptional reporters excepted, and there the MF is legitimate). The
distinguishing action is **non-core demotion**, not removal — see the action
and aspect tables in [`../ASSAY_TO_FUNCTION.md`](../ASSAY_TO_FUNCTION.md). The
"core only if in the machinery" discriminator is read directly off the
ACCEPT-vs-downgrade contrasts above.

**Extension validates the constraint.** Adding 12 new readout classes (migration/
invasion, adhesion, endocytosis, secretion, metabolic flux, DNA-damage foci,
senescence, and pathway reporters for Wnt/NF-κB/Notch/Hippo/hypoxia) reproduced
the same pattern: every new aligned class is BP/CC-dominant with ~zero MF (the
sole MF, LRRK2 *β-catenin destruction complex binding*, is a binding MF already
non-core), and each shows elevated non-core demotion (migration 16/35,
membrane-trafficking 7/14, Wnt 8/17). Re-review of the standing-`ACCEPT`
candidates again found the flagger's precision-on-accepted-calls low: they are
either the **machinery** (BRCA1/2, CLTC, TFRC, CTNNB1, TRAF6, ARNT, TP53 —
correctly core) or a **signature output** of a dedicated ligand (CCL11/PDGF
chemotaxis — correctly core, already in `core_functions`). The machinery and
signature-vs-incidental discriminators are doing the real work.
