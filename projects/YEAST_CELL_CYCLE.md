# Yeast Cell Cycle & Translation Control

## Overview

This project reviews *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* genes central to **cell cycle regulation** with emphasis on novel **translational control mechanisms** discovered in 2024. The focus bridges classical cell cycle biology with emerging understanding of how **translation factors** and **ribosome dynamics** control cell-cycle-dependent gene expression independent of transcriptional regulation.

## Key Research Areas

1. **G1 Phase & Cell Cycle Entry** - Transcriptional and translational mechanisms controlling Start
2. **Cyclin-CDK Complexes** - CLN (G1 cyclins), CLB (S/G2/M cyclins) and regulation
3. **Cell Size Checkpoint Control** - Cln3, Whi5, and emerging translational checkpoints
4. **mRNA Translation During Cell Cycle** - Global and gene-specific translation changes
5. **Ribosome Biogenesis** - Coupled to cell cycle and cell size
6. **CDK Inhibitors & Regulation** - Sic1, Cdk inhibition mechanisms

## Biological Significance

- **Conservation** - Cell cycle mechanisms highly conserved in higher eukaryotes
- **Translation as regulatory layer** - Post-transcriptional control drives cell-cycle timing
- **Cell size sensing** - Novel mechanisms linking growth, ribosome capacity, and cycle entry
- **Disease relevance** - Cancer cells dysregulate similar mechanisms
- **Synthetic biology** - Engineering cell cycle timing for biotechnology

## Project Goals

- Review genes controlling G1-S transition with focus on translational regulation
- Assess GO annotations for cell-cycle-dependent translation control
- Identify genes at intersection of ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle
- Propose refined annotations reflecting translational checkpoints
- Create reference for cell cycle regulation research
