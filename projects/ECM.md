# Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Project

## Overview

This project focuses on reviewing genes involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM), a complex network of proteins and polysaccharides that provides structural and biochemical support to surrounding cells.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Core ECM Components

- [x] Review human AGRN (Agrin) - IN_PROGRESS
- [x] Review human HSPG2 (Perlecan) - IN_PROGRESS
- [x] Review human EPYC (Epiphycan) - COMPLETE

### Phase 2: SPARC/Osteonectin Family (Testican/SPOCK proteins)

- [x] Review human SPOCK1 (Testican-1) - IN_PROGRESS
- [x] Review human SPOCK2 (Testican-2) - IN_PROGRESS
- [x] Review human SPOCK3 (Testican-3) - IN_PROGRESS

### Phase 3: Diverse ECM Components

- [ ] Review human NID1 (Nidogen-1) - Basement membrane linker
- [ ] Review human FN1 (Fibronectin) - Major ECM glycoprotein
- [ ] Review human DCN (Decorin) - Small leucine-rich proteoglycan
- [ ] Review human SPARC (Osteonectin/SPARC) - Matricellular protein

## Status

Started: 2025-11-10
- Phase 1: AGRN and HSPG2 in progress, EPYC complete
- Phase 2 Added: 2025-11-11 - All three SPOCK genes reviewed and validated
- Phase 3 Added: 2025-11-11 - Expanding to diverse ECM protein classes

## Notes

**SPOCK proteins (Testican family):**
- Proteoglycans belonging to the SPARC/osteonectin family
- Modular structure with follistatin-like and extracellular calcium-binding domains
- Chondroitin/heparan sulfate chains
- **Key finding**: SPOCK2 uniquely acts as counter-inhibitor, blocking SPOCK1/3 MMP inhibition
- Roles in ECM assembly, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and cancer

**Phase 3 rationale:**
- **NID1**: Bridges laminin to collagen IV networks in basement membranes
- **FN1**: Cell adhesion, migration, wound healing
- **DCN**: Collagen fibrillogenesis, TGF-β regulation
- **SPARC**: Parent family member, Ca²⁺ binding, collagen binding, anti-adhesive
