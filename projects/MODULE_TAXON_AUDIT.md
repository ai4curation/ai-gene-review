# Module literature, taxonomy and member review audit

Audit every module in `modules/`, with one curation PR per module. Each audit must
search for relevant review literature, curate the references and mine specific
findings, attach evidence to individual steps and connections, assess the appropriate
taxonomic scope, verify family assignments and sample informative exemplars across
that scope, and complete individual member gene reviews. Follow each PR through
review, checks and merge. A module is not finished merely because its YAML validates
or its existing status says COMPLETE.

## Coverage and completion criteria

[Inventory](MODULE_TAXON_AUDIT/inventory.json) records the initial 702-module universe
at commit `18649bf003`. Every module starts unaudited for this project, including the
20 already labelled COMPLETE. Structural counts are triage aids, not biological
judgments. Recheck upstream for new, renamed and removed modules before declaring
this project finished. Open PR overlaps are leads to inspect, not proof that the
work has been done; broad PR #5076 alone overlaps many modules.

For each module, record evidence that all of the following are satisfied:

1. Review literature was searched; relevant references have manual assessments and
   mined findings, corroborated with primary work for decisive mechanistic claims.
2. Individual steps and their connections cite evidence appropriate to the claim.
3. The taxonomic envelope and lineage-specific alternatives are explained without
   asserting universal presence from sparse samples.
4. Each applicable leaf has a verified family selector and informative exemplars
   spanning the relevant scope; missing family IDs stay unasserted until established.
5. Each exemplar has an individual gene review with source-specific reasoning,
   validation and session provenance. Unresolved biology is documented explicitly.
6. A module-specific PR has passed required checks, addressed review feedback and
   merged. Record its number and merge commit before marking the audit complete.

## Status

- [x] `2_aminoethylphosphonate_degradation`: [PR #5538](https://github.com/ai4curation/ai-gene-review/pull/5538) merged after approval and required checks, at `7d28f887b2dbbab34afee940716ba660efc3a173`. Six member reviews, comparative literature, step/edge evidence and taxon/family grounding were rechecked in the merged content.
- [x] `abscisic_acid_signaling`: [PR #5540](https://github.com/ai4curation/ai-gene-review/pull/5540) merged as `d4ae4f02f7ab9759d41d104d7cd7af0ec66abb16`. All 19 reviews (524 rows), 26 references and lineage-specific signaling constraints were verified in merged content after approved checks.
- [x] `activin_receptor_signaling`: [PR #5541](https://github.com/ai4curation/ai-gene-review/pull/5541) merged as `aff0030d3689b50ae9f6d147fc8334a0b942f0a7`. All 11 reviews, 29 references, taxon/step evidence and session histories were verified unchanged from the approved head.
- [x] `adp_heptose_biosynthesis`: [PR #5542](https://github.com/ai4curation/ai-gene-review/pull/5542) merged as `8954a5dc480f1311f440eb4e50f5cefca5931980` after approval and required checks. Its 16 member reviews, 12 references and 26 histories were inspected; 44 curated/history files match the approved head.
- [x] `adrenal_steroidogenesis`: [PR #5543](https://github.com/ai4curation/ai-gene-review/pull/5543) merged as `72b4d12be1a4b1dbbd1e4abd526ecfd4e06b7a3f` after approval and required checks. All 13 reviews (434 rows), 26 references and 25 histories are curated; 65 scoped curation/history files match the approved head.
- [x] `aerobic_nicotinate_degradation`: [PR #5544](https://github.com/ai4curation/ai-gene-review/pull/5544) merged as `94a80ada9f7143d2fb1b38b5e97a5301859c0a7c`. Twelve references and twelve member reviews (43 rows) were verified; 64 scoped curated/history files match the approved head. The NicD localization supersession is recorded in the older audit ledger.
- [x] `alcoholic_fermentation`: [PR #5545](https://github.com/ai4curation/ai-gene-review/pull/5545) merged as `16bffd8e632185a8be7f5d9936d01c18017d33f7`. All 23 members (487 original rows), 34 references and revised BdhA family scope were verified; all 105 scoped curation/history files match the approved head.
- [ ] `alginate_o_acetylation`: [PR #5546](https://github.com/ai4curation/ai-gene-review/pull/5546) has renewed approval and passing required checks at `a2d643bc55`; normal merge requested. Fifteen references and 12 member reviews (52 rows) are curated, with module/member and separate project provenance. Tracking fields and the intentional Azotobacter `algV` alias are clarified in the follow-up.
- [ ] `alginate_polymerization_export`: [draft PR #5552](https://github.com/ai4curation/ai-gene-review/pull/5552) contains 22 curated references, 18 member reviews (94 rows) and 26 histories. Full repository validation and independent QA pass. Readiness awaits the three shared AlgX reviews in #5546, then rebase and consistency checks.
- [ ] `aliphatic_glucosinolate_myrosinase_defense`: [PR #5550](https://github.com/ai4curation/ai-gene-review/pull/5550) has 31 curated references and 35 member reviews (453 rows). Full validation passed. Review follow-up restores supporting quotations, adjudicates source-resolvable localization claims and aligns IPMI activity/donor scope; renewed review remains required.
- [ ] `androgen_receptor_signaling`: all 15 gene reviews (1,683 rows) pass targeted validation; the 26-reference module covers characterized jawed vertebrates with contextual cofactors and signed regulatory edges. Full repository validation is running.
- [ ] `anti_crispr_suppression`: literature and module audit started in an isolated worktree. Existing members, new archaeal/Cas9/Cas13 exemplars and archived AcrVA5 are under review; SIRV1 biochemical activity is separated from the disputed native counterdefence claim.
- [ ] Remaining 690 baseline modules: recorded individually as NOT_STARTED. Seven of 702 baseline audits are complete; three further module PRs are open and two modules are in progress. Refresh upstream additions before final completion.

## Notes

### 2026-10-25

The initial inventory found 682 DRAFT and 20 COMPLETE modules. A survey of 239 open
PRs, with a separate paginated file listing for #5076, found overlapping PRs for 318
current modules. GitHub's other PR file lists can be truncated; check exact paths
before assigning a module or treating an apparent absence as definitive.

The first audit uses the 2023 phosphonate-catabolism review (PMID:37836707), primary
PhnW biochemistry (PMID:12107130), comparative Bacillus/Salmonella PhnX biochemistry
(PMID:9649311), and alternative oxidative entry pathways (PMID:37876809). It preserves
the distinction between assayed proteins and homology-based KT2440 assignments.
Falcon/fallback research requests for new members failed authentication or quota
checks; individual notes document manual primary-literature research instead.

The ADP-heptose audit also checks the protein architecture boundary: standalone
HldA/HldC, bifunctional HldE and trifunctional SepB provide different implementations
of the same reactions. Archived DSM2067 records preserve strain identity after UniProt proteome pruning;
only the kinase has an exact published-construct match, while three assignments remain qualified; the engineered S2 host is not mislabeled
as an endogenous producer. The overlapping broad PR #5076 supplies ancestry edits
but does not replace this literature, taxon and member audit.

### 2026-10-26

Verified nicotinate merge content and continued the alginate and glucosinolate audits. The glucosinolate critical review supports Brassicaceae scope for chain-elongated methionine chemistry; broader glucosinolate occurrence is not evidence for this complete pathway. Family membership checks preserve dual P450 assignments and distinguish demonstrated single-member activity from unresolved subfamily boundaries.

The alginate acetylation audit deliberately uses `algV` for Azotobacter O52197, whose current UniProt primary name is `algJ` and synonym is `algV`. The alias distinguishes this acetylation protein from the historically named outer-membrane export AlgJ (Q44497, now `algE`); it is an explicit curation naming choice, not the fetched primary symbol. The final panel has 42 original GOA rows, four retained older proposals and six added proposals (52 total). Full validation has passed. History totals are reported by target scope rather than a moving PR delta after upstream merges.
