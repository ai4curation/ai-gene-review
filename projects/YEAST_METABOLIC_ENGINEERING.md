# Yeast Metabolic Engineering & Bioproduction

## Overview

This project reviews *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* genes central to metabolic engineering for bioproduction. Recent computational studies (ecFactory, 2024) have identified key genetic targets for optimizing production of bioethanol, specialty chemicals, and renewable fuels. The focus is on:

1. **Primary alcohol production pathway** - ethanol fermentation (PDC1, ADH1, ADH2)
2. **Byproduct suppression** - reducing glycerol accumulation (GPD1, GPD2)
3. **Redox metabolism** - NAD+/NADH balance for efficient fermentation
4. **Central carbon metabolism** - glucose catabolism and cofactor recycling
5. **Stress tolerance genes** - enabling production under harsh conditions

## Biological Significance

These genes represent foundational metabolic functions that can be rationally engineered to:
- Increase ethanol/chemical yields per glucose
- Reduce undesired byproducts
- Improve strain robustness under industrial conditions
- Enable new synthetic pathways for novel chemical production

## Project Goals

- Synthesize current knowledge of metabolic engineering targets in yeast
- Review existing GO annotations for accuracy and completeness
- Identify gaps in functional annotation
- Propose improved terms reflecting engineering-relevant functions
- Create a reference resource for metabolic engineering research
