# Yeast DNA Repair & Chromatin Dynamics

## Overview

This project reviews *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* genes central to **DNA damage response**, **homologous recombination**, and **chromatin remodeling**. The 2024 research breakthrough using high-throughput 3D imaging revealed novel **chromatin reconfiguration mechanisms** during DNA repair, coupled with new understanding of **histone recycling** and **FACT complex dynamics** at the replication fork.

## Key Research Areas

1. **DNA Damage Recognition & Signaling** - Sensor complexes and checkpoint control
2. **Homologous Recombination (HR)** - RAD51/52 filament formation and strand invasion
3. **Double-Strand Break Repair** - Resection, homology search, recombination
4. **Chromatin Reconfiguration** - Spatial reorganization following DNA damage
5. **FACT Complex & Histone Dynamics** - Histone recycling during replication/repair
6. **Base Excision Repair (BER)** - Single-strand break and oxidative damage repair
7. **Mismatch Repair (MMR)** - Replication error correction

## Biological Significance

- **Conservation** - DNA repair mechanisms highly conserved; yeast reveals eukaryotic principles
- **Structural biology** - Cryo-EM revealing molecular mechanisms (FACT-replisome, nucleosome dynamics)
- **Genomic stability** - Central to preventing mutations and cancer
- **Epigenetics** - FACT and chromatin remodeling maintain epigenetic memory during repair
- **Disease models** - Defects in yeast homologs found in cancer and hereditary disorders

## Project Goals

- Review genes central to DNA damage response and repair pathways
- Assess GO annotations for DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and histone dynamics
- Identify genes at intersection of DNA repair and epigenetics
- Incorporate emerging structural biology insights (FACT-replisome complexes)
- Create reference for DNA repair and chromatin dynamics research
