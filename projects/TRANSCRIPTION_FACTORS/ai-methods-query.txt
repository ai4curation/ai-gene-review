What are the current state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods for predicting transcription factor function from protein amino acid sequences? I am specifically interested in:

1. **Classification approaches**: Methods that predict whether a protein is a transcription factor, transcriptional coactivator, transcriptional corepressor, chromatin remodeler, or general transcription machinery component based solely on primary sequence.

2. **Deep learning architectures**: How are transformer models (like ESM, ProtTrans, BERT-based protein language models), convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks being applied to TF classification? What sequence features do these models learn?

3. **DNA-binding domain prediction**: Methods for predicting the presence and type of DNA-binding domains (zinc finger, helix-turn-helix, leucine zipper, bHLH, homeodomain, etc.) from sequence without relying on existing domain databases.

4. **Functional subtype prediction**: Can models distinguish between:
   - Sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors vs general transcription factors
   - Activators vs repressors
   - Pioneer factors vs non-pioneer factors
   - Direct DNA binders vs cofactors that lack DNA-binding activity

5. **Benchmark datasets**: What gold-standard datasets exist for training and evaluating TF classifiers? How are negative examples (non-TF proteins) selected? What taxonomic scope do these datasets cover?

6. **Comparison with traditional methods**: How do ML/DL methods compare with:
   - Hidden Markov Models (Pfam, InterPro)
   - Position-specific scoring matrices
   - Sequence similarity/homology-based methods
   - DBD (DNA-Binding Domain) database approaches

7. **Interpretability**: What methods exist for understanding which sequence features or regions contribute to TF predictions? How can we extract biological insights from these models?

8. **Recent tools and databases**: What are the most recent (2023-2026) published tools, web servers, or databases for sequence-based TF prediction? Include tools like TFpredict, DeepTF, or similar.

9. **Limitations and challenges**: What are the main limitations of current approaches? How do they handle:
   - Novel TF families with no homology to known TFs
   - Moonlighting proteins with dual TF/non-TF functions
   - Intrinsically disordered regions common in TFs
   - Species-specific vs evolutionarily conserved predictions

10. **Integration with other data**: Methods that combine sequence features with structural predictions (AlphaFold), evolutionary information (MSAs), or functional annotations for improved TF prediction.

Please focus on methodological papers and benchmarking studies rather than individual TF characterization papers. Prioritize peer-reviewed publications from 2020-2025.
