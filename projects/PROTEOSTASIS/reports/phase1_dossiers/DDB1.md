## PN row 1: Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway | Autophagophore initiation and elongation | Class 3 PI3K complex 1, direct | Modulator of class 3 PI3K complex 1 activity | Modulator of BECN1 ubiquitination
- UniProt: Q16531
- In branches: ALP, UPS
- Notes: CUL4A/B-DDB1-AMBRA1 complex mediates K63 ubiquitination of BECN1, increasing activity of VPS34

    - [subtype] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagophore initiation and elongation|Class 3 PI3K complex 1, direct|Modulator of class 3 PI3K complex 1 activity|Modulator of BECN1 ubiquitination
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0035032 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, class III]
        rationale: Reviewed as a class-III PI3K complex context or regulator bucket. This node is useful for curator interpretation, but it should not project cellular-component membership; only explicit complex-component leaves propagate to GO complex terms.
    - [type] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagophore initiation and elongation|Class 3 PI3K complex 1, direct|Modulator of class 3 PI3K complex 1 activity
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0035032 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, class III]
        rationale: Reviewed as a class-III PI3K complex context or regulator bucket. This node is useful for curator interpretation, but it should not project cellular-component membership; only explicit complex-component leaves propagate to GO complex terms.
    - [group] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagophore initiation and elongation|Class 3 PI3K complex 1, direct
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0035032 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, class III]
        rationale: Reviewed as a class-III PI3K complex context or regulator bucket. This node is useful for curator interpretation, but it should not project cellular-component membership; only explicit complex-component leaves propagate to GO complex terms.
    - [class] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagophore initiation and elongation
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0016236 macroautophagy]
        rationale: This class is a real macroautophagy context, but its descendants include core factors, component buckets, upstream modulators, localization roles, and residual categories. Projecting generic macroautophagy from this ancestor creates TRAPP-like overpropagation, so candidate GO annotations must come from narrower curated nodes.
    - [branch] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level PN branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; all propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.

## PN row 2: Ubiquitin Proteasome System | E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases | Cullin adaptor | DDB1
- UniProt: Q16531
- In branches: ALP, UPS
- Signature domains: (none)
- Auxiliary domains: IPR015943
- PN references (titles):
    - 19337321
    - 19276361
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [type] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|Cullin adaptor|DDB1
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower substrate-receptor, adaptor, domain, or family subdivision already covered by the curated parent adaptor/receptor mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [group] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|Cullin adaptor
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:1990756 ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity]
        rationale: This PN group captures substrate receptors/adaptors for cullin/UBL ligase systems. The shared GO molecular-function target is ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity.
    - [class] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0061630 ubiquitin protein ligase activity]
        rationale: This class is a genuine E3-ligase context, but its descendants include catalytic ligases, cullin scaffolds, substrate receptors, adaptors, cofactors, regulators, and UBL modifier systems. A class-level propagation would over-annotate.
    - [branch] Ubiquitin Proteasome System
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level UPS branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; UPS propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
