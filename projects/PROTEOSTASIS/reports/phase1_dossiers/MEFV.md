## PN row 1: Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway | Autophagy substrate selection | Selective autophagy receptor | Individual substrates
- UniProt: O15553
- In branches: ALP, UPS
- Notes: TRIM20 and TRIM21 bind to targets for degradation and recruit autophagy components.
- PN references (titles):

- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [type] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Selective autophagy receptor|Individual substrates
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0160247 autophagy cargo adaptor activity]
        rationale: This PN category groups receptors such as TRIM-family factors that bind specific substrates and recruit autophagy components for their turnover. That aligns best with autophagy cargo adaptor activity rather than with a single selective-autophagy process term.
    - [group] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Selective autophagy receptor
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad PN taxonomy container. The descendants mix components, regulators, context labels, and mechanistic leaves, so propagation should come only from narrower curated nodes.
    - [class] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad substrate-selection container. GO has useful targets for specific receptor, cargo-adaptor, and selective-autophagy leaves, but this class mixes marking, recognition, receptor regulation, and unknown roles and should not propagate as one term.
    - [branch] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level PN branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; all propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.

## PN row 2: Ubiquitin Proteasome System | E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases | RING | TRIM / unclassified | Pyrin, ringless, SPRY
- UniProt: O15553
- In branches: ALP, UPS
- Signature domains: (none)
- Auxiliary domains: IPR004020, IPR003877, IPR006574
- PN references (titles):
    - 33791238 / rev
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|RING|TRIM / unclassified|Pyrin, ringless, SPRY
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower E3-ligase architecture, component, or domain subdivision already covered by the curated parent E3 mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [type] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|RING|TRIM / unclassified
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower E3-ligase architecture, component, or domain subdivision already covered by the curated parent E3 mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [group] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|RING
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0061630 ubiquitin protein ligase activity]
        rationale: This PN group is a catalytic ubiquitin E3 ligase bucket. The shared GO molecular-function target is ubiquitin protein ligase activity.
    - [class] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0061630 ubiquitin protein ligase activity]
        rationale: This class is a genuine E3-ligase context, but its descendants include catalytic ligases, cullin scaffolds, substrate receptors, adaptors, cofactors, regulators, and UBL modifier systems. A class-level propagation would over-annotate.
    - [branch] Ubiquitin Proteasome System
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level UPS branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; UPS propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
