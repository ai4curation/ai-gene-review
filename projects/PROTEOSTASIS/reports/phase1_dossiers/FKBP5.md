## PN row 1: Cytonuclear proteostasis | Chaperone | HSP90 system | HSP90 cochaperone | CC-TPR and PPIase domain containing
- UniProt: Q13451
- In branches: CY, ALP
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Cytonuclear proteostasis|Chaperone|HSP90 system|HSP90 cochaperone|CC-TPR and PPIase domain containing
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a mixed HSP90 cochaperone subtype with FKBP/PPIase-like members. The parent HSP90-cochaperone mapping captures the shared HSP90-binding role; a subtype-level PPIase mapping would overstate the activity for all members.
    - [type] Cytonuclear proteostasis|Chaperone|HSP90 system|HSP90 cochaperone
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0051879 Hsp90 protein binding]
        rationale: This PN type groups HSP90 cochaperones. Hsp90 protein binding is the most defensible shared GO molecular-function target for propagation.
    - [group] Cytonuclear proteostasis|Chaperone|HSP90 system
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad PN category rather than a specific GO class. The member genes span multiple activities, complexes, or contexts, so propagation from this node would overstate the shared biology; use narrower child or gene-level curations.
    - [class] Cytonuclear proteostasis|Chaperone
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad PN category rather than a specific GO class. The member genes span multiple activities, complexes, or contexts, so propagation from this node would overstate the shared biology; use narrower child or gene-level curations.
    - [branch] Cytonuclear proteostasis
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a top-level PN branch. This is a systems/taxonomy umbrella, not a direct GO assertion; narrower child curations carry any propagating GO mappings.

## PN row 2: Cytonuclear proteostasis | Folding enzyme | Peptidyl-prolyl isomerases | FKBP type
- UniProt: Q13451
- In branches: CY, ALP
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [type] Cytonuclear proteostasis|Folding enzyme|Peptidyl-prolyl isomerases|FKBP type
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0003755 peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity]
        rationale: This PN type denotes FKBP-family peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. The matching GO molecular-function term is appropriate for propagation.
    - [group] Cytonuclear proteostasis|Folding enzyme|Peptidyl-prolyl isomerases
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0003755 peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity]
        rationale: This PN group is the cytonuclear peptidyl-prolyl isomerase branch. The matching GO molecular-function term is appropriate for propagation.
    - [class] Cytonuclear proteostasis|Folding enzyme
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad PN category rather than a specific GO class. The member genes span multiple activities, complexes, or contexts, so propagation from this node would overstate the shared biology; use narrower child or gene-level curations.
    - [branch] Cytonuclear proteostasis
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a top-level PN branch. This is a systems/taxonomy umbrella, not a direct GO assertion; narrower child curations carry any propagating GO mappings.

## PN row 3: Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway | Autophagophore initiation and elongation | Class 3 PI3K complex 1, direct | Modulator of class 3 PI3K complex 1 activity | Modulator of BECN1 availability
- UniProt: Q13451
- In branches: CY, ALP
- Notes: Enhances autophagy. Associates with BECN1 and influences its phosphorylation.

- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagophore initiation and elongation|Class 3 PI3K complex 1, direct|Modulator of class 3 PI3K complex 1 activity|Modulator of BECN1 availability
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0035032 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, class III]
        rationale: Reviewed as a class-III PI3K complex context or regulator bucket. This node is useful for curator interpretation, but it should not project cellular-component membership; only explicit complex-component leaves propagate to GO complex terms.
    - [type] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagophore initiation and elongation|Class 3 PI3K complex 1, direct|Modulator of class 3 PI3K complex 1 activity
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0035032 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, class III]
        rationale: Reviewed as a class-III PI3K complex context or regulator bucket. This node is useful for curator interpretation, but it should not project cellular-component membership; only explicit complex-component leaves propagate to GO complex terms.
    - [group] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagophore initiation and elongation|Class 3 PI3K complex 1, direct
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0035032 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, class III]
        rationale: Reviewed as a class-III PI3K complex context or regulator bucket. This node is useful for curator interpretation, but it should not project cellular-component membership; only explicit complex-component leaves propagate to GO complex terms.
    - [class] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagophore initiation and elongation
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0016236 macroautophagy]
        rationale: This class is a real macroautophagy context, but its descendants include core factors, component buckets, upstream modulators, localization roles, and residual categories. Projecting generic macroautophagy from this ancestor creates TRAPP-like overpropagation, so candidate GO annotations must come from narrower curated nodes.
    - [branch] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level PN branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; all propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
