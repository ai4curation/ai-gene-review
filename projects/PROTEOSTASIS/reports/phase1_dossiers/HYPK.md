## PN row 1: Translation | Cytosolic translation | Nascent peptide husbandry | N-terminal acetylation of nascent peptide | Modulator of NatA and NatE complexes
- UniProt: Q9NX55
- In branches: TR, UPS
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Translation|Cytosolic translation|Nascent peptide husbandry|N-terminal acetylation of nascent peptide|Modulator of NatA and NatE complexes
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower taxonomy bucket already covered by a curated parent mapping or by gene-level annotations. No additional direct GO mapping is appropriate from this node.
    - [type] Translation|Cytosolic translation|Nascent peptide husbandry|N-terminal acetylation of nascent peptide
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0006474 N-terminal protein amino acid acetylation]
        rationale: This PN type denotes N-terminal acetyltransferase machinery acting on nascent peptides. The GO N-terminal acetylation process is the direct target.
    - [group] Translation|Cytosolic translation|Nascent peptide husbandry
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad PN category rather than a single GO class. The member genes span multiple activities, complexes, or contexts, so direct propagation from this node would overstate the shared biology.
    - [class] Translation|Cytosolic translation
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0002181 cytoplasmic translation]
        rationale: The PN class Cytosolic translation is centered on the cytoplasmic translation apparatus and process, but it also houses supporting machinery such as ribosome biogenesis factors. The GO process term is a useful high-level label for the class, but propagating it to all members would over-annotate genes whose PN placement is through assembly or maturation context rather than core cytoplasmic translation.
    - [branch] Translation
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0006412 translation]
        rationale: The PN Translation branch is organized around the translation apparatus and immediately associated cotranslational quality-control systems. GO translation is the closest high-level process label, but the PN branch also contains adjacent machinery such as ribosome biogenesis and nascent-chain handling. Keeping this relationship is useful for interpretation, but it is too broad to project safely onto every member.

## PN row 2: Ubiquitin Proteasome System | Ubiquitin and UBL binding | other protein modifiers | N-terminal acetylation | UBA (NACA)
- UniProt: Q9NX55
- In branches: TR, UPS
- Signature domains: IPR044034
- Auxiliary domains: (none)
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|Ubiquitin and UBL binding|other protein modifiers|N-terminal acetylation|UBA (NACA)
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed manually as a UPS source node. No single GO term is appropriate for direct propagation from this PN label without narrower context or gene-level evidence.
    - [type] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|Ubiquitin and UBL binding|other protein modifiers|N-terminal acetylation
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a UPS taxonomy container. Its descendants mix catalytic roles, complex membership, binding domains, regulators, adaptors, and substrate-context labels, so a single propagating GO assertion would overstate the shared biology.
    - [group] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|Ubiquitin and UBL binding|other protein modifiers
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a UPS taxonomy container. Its descendants mix catalytic roles, complex membership, binding domains, regulators, adaptors, and substrate-context labels, so a single propagating GO assertion would overstate the shared biology.
    - [class] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|Ubiquitin and UBL binding
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0140036 ubiquitin-modified protein reader activity]
        rationale: This class records ubiquitin/UBL-reader context, but the subtree mixes ubiquitin, SUMO, UBL-domain, domain-architecture, catalytic, signaling, trafficking, and nucleic-acid process buckets. It is useful context, not a safe direct propagation.
    - [branch] Ubiquitin Proteasome System
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level UPS branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; UPS propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
