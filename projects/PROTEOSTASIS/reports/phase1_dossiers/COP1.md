## PN row 1: Ubiquitin Proteasome System | E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases | Cul4A/Cul4B substrate adaptor | WD40 | other
- UniProt: Q8NHY2
- In branches: UPS
- Signature domains: (none)
- Auxiliary domains: IPR001680
- PN references (titles):
    - 17588513 rev
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|Cul4A/Cul4B substrate adaptor|WD40|other
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower substrate-receptor, adaptor, domain, or family subdivision already covered by the curated parent adaptor/receptor mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [type] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|Cul4A/Cul4B substrate adaptor|WD40
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower substrate-receptor, adaptor, domain, or family subdivision already covered by the curated parent adaptor/receptor mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [group] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|Cul4A/Cul4B substrate adaptor
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:1990756 ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity]
        rationale: This PN group captures substrate receptors/adaptors for cullin/UBL ligase systems. The shared GO molecular-function target is ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity.
    - [class] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0061630 ubiquitin protein ligase activity]
        rationale: This class is a genuine E3-ligase context, but its descendants include catalytic ligases, cullin scaffolds, substrate receptors, adaptors, cofactors, regulators, and UBL modifier systems. A class-level propagation would over-annotate.
    - [branch] Ubiquitin Proteasome System
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level UPS branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; UPS propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.

## PN row 2: Ubiquitin Proteasome System | E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases | RING | RFWD | WD40
- UniProt: Q8NHY2
- In branches: UPS
- Signature domains: IPR001841
- Auxiliary domains: IPR001680
- PN references (titles):
    - 19489725 / rev
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|RING|RFWD|WD40
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower E3-ligase architecture, component, or domain subdivision already covered by the curated parent E3 mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [type] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|RING|RFWD
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]

        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0061630 ubiquitin protein ligase activity]
        rationale: This PN group is a catalytic ubiquitin E3 ligase bucket. The shared GO molecular-function target is ubiquitin protein ligase activity.
    - [class] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases
