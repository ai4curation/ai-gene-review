## PN row 1: Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway | Autophagosome closure maturation and lysosome fusion | Specific function in autophagosome maturation and lysosome fusion unknown
- UniProt: Q00535
- In branches: ALP
- Notes: Ser/Thr kinase. In Drosophila, phosphorylates ACN thereby stabilizing it and promoting basal autophagy
- PN references (titles):

- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [group] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagosome closure maturation and lysosome fusion|Specific function in autophagosome maturation and lysosome fusion unknown
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as an unknown or residual PN category. The label does not provide a shared GO-mappable biological process, molecular function, or cellular component.
    - [class] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagosome closure maturation and lysosome fusion
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0016236 macroautophagy]
        rationale: This class is a late macroautophagy context, but the subtree mixes docking, fusion, localization, membrane-composition, and unknown late-stage roles. The class-level relation is useful for display while propagation is restricted to narrower mechanism nodes.
    - [branch] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level PN branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; all propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
