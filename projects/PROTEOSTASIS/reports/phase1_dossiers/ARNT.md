## PN row 1: Ubiquitin Proteasome System | E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases | Cul4A/Cul4B substrate adaptor | AHR / ARNT / TBL3 complex | PAS
- UniProt: P27540
- In branches: UPS
- Signature domains: (none)
- Auxiliary domains: IPR000014
- PN references (titles):
    - 17392787

- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|Cul4A/Cul4B substrate adaptor|AHR / ARNT / TBL3 complex|PAS
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower substrate-receptor, adaptor, domain, or family subdivision already covered by the curated parent adaptor/receptor mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [type] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|Cul4A/Cul4B substrate adaptor|AHR / ARNT / TBL3 complex
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower substrate-receptor, adaptor, domain, or family subdivision already covered by the curated parent adaptor/receptor mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [group] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|Cul4A/Cul4B substrate adaptor
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:1990756 ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity]
        rationale: This PN group captures substrate receptors/adaptors for cullin/UBL ligase systems. The shared GO molecular-function target is ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity.
    - [class] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0061630 ubiquitin protein ligase activity]
        rationale: This class is a genuine E3-ligase context, but its descendants include catalytic ligases, cullin scaffolds, substrate receptors, adaptors, cofactors, regulators, and UBL modifier systems. A class-level propagation would over-annotate.
    - [branch] Ubiquitin Proteasome System
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level UPS branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; UPS propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
