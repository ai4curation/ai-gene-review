## PN row 1: Ubiquitin Proteasome System | E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases | idiosyncratic RING complex | LMBR1L-GP78-UBAC2 complex | noncatalytic / UBA, transmembrane
- UniProt: Q8NBM4
- In branches: UPS
- Signature domains: (none)
- Auxiliary domains: IPR015940
- PN references (titles):
    - 31073040
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|idiosyncratic RING complex|LMBR1L-GP78-UBAC2 complex|noncatalytic / UBA, transmembrane
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower E3-ligase architecture, component, or domain subdivision already covered by the curated parent E3 mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [type] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|idiosyncratic RING complex|LMBR1L-GP78-UBAC2 complex
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower E3-ligase architecture, component, or domain subdivision already covered by the curated parent E3 mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [group] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|idiosyncratic RING complex
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0000151 ubiquitin ligase complex]
        rationale: This PN group is an E3 ligase complex bucket. The safest shared GO target is ubiquitin ligase complex membership rather than assigning catalytic activity to every subunit.
    - [class] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0061630 ubiquitin protein ligase activity]
        rationale: This class is a genuine E3-ligase context, but its descendants include catalytic ligases, cullin scaffolds, substrate receptors, adaptors, cofactors, regulators, and UBL modifier systems. A class-level propagation would over-annotate.
    - [branch] Ubiquitin Proteasome System
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level UPS branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; UPS propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.

## PN row 2: Ubiquitin Proteasome System | Ubiquitin and UBL binding | trafficking | ERphagy | UBA
- UniProt: Q8NBM4
- In branches: UPS
- Signature domains: IPR015940
- Auxiliary domains: (none)
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|Ubiquitin and UBL binding|trafficking|ERphagy|UBA
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a selective-autophagy or trafficking subdivision under a UPS binding context. The autophagy context is real, but this node is too indirect for automatic GO propagation.
    - [type] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|Ubiquitin and UBL binding|trafficking|ERphagy
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a UPS taxonomy container. Its descendants mix catalytic roles, complex membership, binding domains, regulators, adaptors, and substrate-context labels, so a single propagating GO assertion would overstate the shared biology.
    - [group] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|Ubiquitin and UBL binding|trafficking
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a UPS taxonomy container. Its descendants mix catalytic roles, complex membership, binding domains, regulators, adaptors, and substrate-context labels, so a single propagating GO assertion would overstate the shared biology.
    - [class] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|Ubiquitin and UBL binding
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0140036 ubiquitin-modified protein reader activity]
        rationale: This class records ubiquitin/UBL-reader context, but the subtree mixes ubiquitin, SUMO, UBL-domain, domain-architecture, catalytic, signaling, trafficking, and nucleic-acid process buckets. It is useful context, not a safe direct propagation.
    - [branch] Ubiquitin Proteasome System
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level UPS branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; UPS propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
