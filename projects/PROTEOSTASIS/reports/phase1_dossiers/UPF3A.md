## PN row 1: Translation | Cytosolic translation | Translation termination | Modulation of termination
- UniProt: Q9H1J1
- In branches: TR
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [type] Translation|Cytosolic translation|Translation termination|Modulation of termination
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a contextual PN bucket. The label is useful for curator triage, but no direct GO mapping is appropriate because propagation would add a process, activity, or localization not shared cleanly by all members.
    - [group] Translation|Cytosolic translation|Translation termination
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0006415 translational termination]
        rationale: This PN group denotes cytosolic translation termination and release factors. Translational termination is the shared process target.
    - [class] Translation|Cytosolic translation
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0002181 cytoplasmic translation]
        rationale: The PN class Cytosolic translation is centered on the cytoplasmic translation apparatus and process, but it also houses supporting machinery such as ribosome biogenesis factors. The GO process term is a useful high-level label for the class, but propagating it to all members would over-annotate genes whose PN placement is through assembly or maturation context rather than core cytoplasmic translation.
    - [branch] Translation
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0006412 translation]
        rationale: The PN Translation branch is organized around the translation apparatus and immediately associated cotranslational quality-control systems. GO translation is the closest high-level process label, but the PN branch also contains adjacent machinery such as ribosome biogenesis and nascent-chain handling. Keeping this relationship is useful for interpretation, but it is too broad to project safely onto every member.
