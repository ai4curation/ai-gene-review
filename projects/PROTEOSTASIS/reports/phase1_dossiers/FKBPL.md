## PN row 1: Cytonuclear proteostasis | Chaperone | HSP90 system | HSP90 cochaperone | CC-TPR and PPIase domain containing
- UniProt: Q9UIM3
- In branches: CY
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Cytonuclear proteostasis|Chaperone|HSP90 system|HSP90 cochaperone|CC-TPR and PPIase domain containing
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a mixed HSP90 cochaperone subtype with FKBP/PPIase-like members. The parent HSP90-cochaperone mapping captures the shared HSP90-binding role; a subtype-level PPIase mapping would overstate the activity for all members.
    - [type] Cytonuclear proteostasis|Chaperone|HSP90 system|HSP90 cochaperone
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0051879 Hsp90 protein binding]
        rationale: This PN type groups HSP90 cochaperones. Hsp90 protein binding is the most defensible shared GO molecular-function target for propagation.
    - [group] Cytonuclear proteostasis|Chaperone|HSP90 system
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad PN category rather than a specific GO class. The member genes span multiple activities, complexes, or contexts, so propagation from this node would overstate the shared biology; use narrower child or gene-level curations.
    - [class] Cytonuclear proteostasis|Chaperone
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad PN category rather than a specific GO class. The member genes span multiple activities, complexes, or contexts, so propagation from this node would overstate the shared biology; use narrower child or gene-level curations.
    - [branch] Cytonuclear proteostasis
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a top-level PN branch. This is a systems/taxonomy umbrella, not a direct GO assertion; narrower child curations carry any propagating GO mappings.
