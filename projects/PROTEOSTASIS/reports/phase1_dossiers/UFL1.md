## PN row 1: Translation | Cytosolic translation | Ribosome-associated QC | UFMylation
- UniProt: O94874
- In branches: TR, ALP, UPS
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [type] Translation|Cytosolic translation|Ribosome-associated QC|UFMylation
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0071569 protein ufmylation]
        rationale: This PN RQC type denotes UFM1 conjugation in ribosome quality control. Protein ufmylation is the shared process target.
    - [group] Translation|Cytosolic translation|Ribosome-associated QC
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0006515 protein quality control for misfolded or incompletely synthesized proteins]
        rationale: The PN ribosome-associated quality-control group covers surveillance and disposal of stalled or defective nascent-chain translation products. GO lacks a dedicated ribosome-associated QC term in the local cache, so the broader protein-quality-control process is the best supported target.
    - [class] Translation|Cytosolic translation
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0002181 cytoplasmic translation]
        rationale: The PN class Cytosolic translation is centered on the cytoplasmic translation apparatus and process, but it also houses supporting machinery such as ribosome biogenesis factors. The GO process term is a useful high-level label for the class, but propagating it to all members would over-annotate genes whose PN placement is through assembly or maturation context rather than core cytoplasmic translation.
    - [branch] Translation
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0006412 translation]
        rationale: The PN Translation branch is organized around the translation apparatus and immediately associated cotranslational quality-control systems. GO translation is the closest high-level process label, but the PN branch also contains adjacent machinery such as ribosome biogenesis and nascent-chain handling. Keeping this relationship is useful for interpretation, but it is too broad to project safely onto every member.

## PN row 2: Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway | Autophagy substrate selection | Marking substrates for selective autophagy | ERphagy | UFMylation of ER proteins
- UniProt: O94874
- In branches: TR, ALP, UPS
- Notes: E3-type protein that catalyzes UFMylation. Knockdown of UFL1 decreased DDRGK1 levels and inhibits ER-phagy.UFL1 UFMylates RPN1 and RPL26 to target ER sheets for degradation.

    - [subtype] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Marking substrates for selective autophagy|ERphagy|UFMylation of ER proteins
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0061709 reticulophagy]
        rationale: This PN subtype captures a specific ER-cargo marking mechanism used in ERphagy. Because GO uses reticulophagy for ER autophagy, this subtype can propagate to reticulophagy.
    - [type] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Marking substrates for selective autophagy|ERphagy
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0061709 reticulophagy]
        rationale: The PN ERphagy marking category captures factors that mark ER cargo for selective autophagic turnover. GO uses reticulophagy for this pathway, so propagation to reticulophagy is appropriate.
    - [group] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Marking substrates for selective autophagy
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad PN taxonomy container. The descendants mix components, regulators, context labels, and mechanistic leaves, so propagation should come only from narrower curated nodes.
    - [class] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad substrate-selection container. GO has useful targets for specific receptor, cargo-adaptor, and selective-autophagy leaves, but this class mixes marking, recognition, receptor regulation, and unknown roles and should not propagate as one term.
    - [branch] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level PN branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; all propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.

## PN row 3: Ubiquitin Proteasome System | E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases | UBL modifiers | UFMylation
- UniProt: O94874
- In branches: TR, ALP, UPS
- Signature domains: IPR056579
- Auxiliary domains: (none)
- PN references (titles):
    - 25852645
    - 20018847
    - 20368332
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [type] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|UBL modifiers|UFMylation
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a UBL-modifier subtype or architecture bucket. The subtree mixes catalytic ligases with cofactors/idiosyncratic contexts, so no direct GO propagation is made from this node.
    - [group] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|UBL modifiers
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0019787 ubiquitin-like protein transferase activity]
        rationale: This group records UBL-modifier ligase context, but descendants include cofactors and idiosyncratic SUMOylation/ATGylation entries that are not uniformly transferase activities. Keep as context only.
    - [class] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0061630 ubiquitin protein ligase activity]
        rationale: This class is a genuine E3-ligase context, but its descendants include catalytic ligases, cullin scaffolds, substrate receptors, adaptors, cofactors, regulators, and UBL modifier systems. A class-level propagation would over-annotate.
    - [branch] Ubiquitin Proteasome System
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level UPS branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; UPS propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
