## PN row 1: Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway | Autophagy substrate selection | Selective autophagy receptor | Mitophagy
- UniProt: Q9BXK5
- In branches: ALP
- Notes: Receptor for selective autophagy. Atg32 homologue binds to LC3/ATG8 and induces mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy in an Parkin independent manner.
- PN references (titles):
    - Selective Autophagy: ATG8 Family Proteins, LIR Motifs and Cargo Receptors - ScienceDirect
    - Bcl-2-like protein 13 is a mammalian Atg32 homologue that mediates mitophagy and mitochondrial fragmentation
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [type] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Selective autophagy receptor|Mitophagy
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0000423 mitophagy]
        rationale: This PN path denotes selective-autophagy receptors for mitochondrial cargo. The source category is a mechanistic sub-role within mitophagy, so propagation rather than exact equivalence is the correct scope.
    - [group] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Selective autophagy receptor
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad PN taxonomy container. The descendants mix components, regulators, context labels, and mechanistic leaves, so propagation should come only from narrower curated nodes.
    - [class] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad substrate-selection container. GO has useful targets for specific receptor, cargo-adaptor, and selective-autophagy leaves, but this class mixes marking, recognition, receptor regulation, and unknown roles and should not propagate as one term.
    - [branch] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level PN branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; all propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
