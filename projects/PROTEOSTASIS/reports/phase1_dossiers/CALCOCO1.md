## PN row 1: Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway | Autophagy substrate selection | Selective autophagy receptor | ERphagy
- UniProt: Q9P1Z2
- In branches: ALP, UPS
- Notes: Adapter for selective autophagy. Binds to ATG8 and ubiquitinated or degron-contaning substrates. Active in ERphagy

- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [type] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Selective autophagy receptor|ERphagy
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0061709 reticulophagy]
        rationale: The PN uses the community label ERphagy for selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum, while GO uses the synonym reticulophagy. Receptor members of this PN category are suitable for propagation to the GO reticulophagy process.
    - [group] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Selective autophagy receptor
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad PN taxonomy container. The descendants mix components, regulators, context labels, and mechanistic leaves, so propagation should come only from narrower curated nodes.
    - [class] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad substrate-selection container. GO has useful targets for specific receptor, cargo-adaptor, and selective-autophagy leaves, but this class mixes marking, recognition, receptor regulation, and unknown roles and should not propagate as one term.
    - [branch] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level PN branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; all propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.

## PN row 2: Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway | Autophagy substrate selection | Selective autophagy receptor | Golgiphagy
- UniProt: Q9P1Z2
- In branches: ALP, UPS
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [type] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Selective autophagy receptor|Golgiphagy
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a contextual PN role. The label is useful for curator triage, but by itself does not support a universal GO assertion for all member genes beyond curated ancestor or child mappings.
    - [group] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Selective autophagy receptor
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad PN taxonomy container. The descendants mix components, regulators, context labels, and mechanistic leaves, so propagation should come only from narrower curated nodes.
    - [class] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection

        rationale: Reviewed as a broad substrate-selection container. GO has useful targets for specific receptor, cargo-adaptor, and selective-autophagy leaves, but this class mixes marking, recognition, receptor regulation, and unknown roles and should not propagate as one term.
    - [branch] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level PN branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; all propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.

## PN row 3: Ubiquitin Proteasome System | Ubiquitin and UBL binding | trafficking | selective autophagy | UBZ1-type ZnF
- UniProt: Q9P1Z2
- In branches: ALP, UPS
- Signature domains: IPR041641
- Auxiliary domains: (none)
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|Ubiquitin and UBL binding|trafficking|selective autophagy|UBZ1-type ZnF
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a selective-autophagy or trafficking subdivision under a UPS binding context. The autophagy context is real, but this node is too indirect for automatic GO propagation.
    - [type] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|Ubiquitin and UBL binding|trafficking|selective autophagy
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a UPS taxonomy container. Its descendants mix catalytic roles, complex membership, binding domains, regulators, adaptors, and substrate-context labels, so a single propagating GO assertion would overstate the shared biology.
    - [group] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|Ubiquitin and UBL binding|trafficking
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a UPS taxonomy container. Its descendants mix catalytic roles, complex membership, binding domains, regulators, adaptors, and substrate-context labels, so a single propagating GO assertion would overstate the shared biology.
    - [class] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|Ubiquitin and UBL binding
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0140036 ubiquitin-modified protein reader activity]
        rationale: This class records ubiquitin/UBL-reader context, but the subtree mixes ubiquitin, SUMO, UBL-domain, domain-architecture, catalytic, signaling, trafficking, and nucleic-acid process buckets. It is useful context, not a safe direct propagation.
    - [branch] Ubiquitin Proteasome System
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level UPS branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; UPS propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
