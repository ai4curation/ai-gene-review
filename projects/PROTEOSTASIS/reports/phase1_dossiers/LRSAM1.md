## PN row 1: Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway | Autophagy substrate selection | Marking substrates for selective autophagy | Xenophagy | Intracellular pathogen ubiquitination
- UniProt: Q6UWE0
- In branches: ALP, UPS
- Notes: E3 ligase involved in ubiquitin-dependent autophagy of intracellular pathogens
- PN references (titles):
    - The LRR and RING Domain Protein LRSAM1 Is an E3 Ligase Crucial for Ubiquitin-Dependent Autophagy of Intracellular Salmonella Typhimurium - ScienceDirect
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Marking substrates for selective autophagy|Xenophagy|Intracellular pathogen ubiquitination
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a contextual PN role. The label is useful for curator triage, but by itself does not support a universal GO assertion for all member genes beyond curated ancestor or child mappings.
    - [type] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Marking substrates for selective autophagy|Xenophagy
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0098792 xenophagy]
        rationale: This PN type groups xenophagy-specific marking steps that label cargo for selective autophagic clearance. That is narrower than, but clearly inside, the xenophagy process.
    - [group] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection|Marking substrates for selective autophagy
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad PN taxonomy container. The descendants mix components, regulators, context labels, and mechanistic leaves, so propagation should come only from narrower curated nodes.
    - [class] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagy substrate selection
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a broad substrate-selection container. GO has useful targets for specific receptor, cargo-adaptor, and selective-autophagy leaves, but this class mixes marking, recognition, receptor regulation, and unknown roles and should not propagate as one term.
    - [branch] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level PN branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; all propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.

## PN row 2: Ubiquitin Proteasome System | E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases | RING | other | LRR
- UniProt: Q6UWE0
- In branches: ALP, UPS
- Signature domains: IPR001841
- Auxiliary domains: IPR001611
- PN references (titles):
    - 19489725 / rev
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|RING|other|LRR
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower E3-ligase architecture, component, or domain subdivision already covered by the curated parent E3 mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [type] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|RING|other
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower E3-ligase architecture, component, or domain subdivision already covered by the curated parent E3 mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [group] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|RING
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0061630 ubiquitin protein ligase activity]
        rationale: This PN group is a catalytic ubiquitin E3 ligase bucket. The shared GO molecular-function target is ubiquitin protein ligase activity.
    - [class] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0061630 ubiquitin protein ligase activity]
        rationale: This class is a genuine E3-ligase context, but its descendants include catalytic ligases, cullin scaffolds, substrate receptors, adaptors, cofactors, regulators, and UBL modifier systems. A class-level propagation would over-annotate.
    - [branch] Ubiquitin Proteasome System
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level UPS branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; UPS propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
