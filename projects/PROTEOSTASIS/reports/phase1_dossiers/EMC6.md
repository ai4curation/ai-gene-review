## PN row 1: ER proteostasis | Protein transport | Transmembrane protein import | EMC complex component
- UniProt: Q9BV81
- In branches: ER, ALP
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [type] ER proteostasis|Protein transport|Transmembrane protein import|EMC complex component
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0072546 EMC complex]
        rationale: This PN type denotes ER membrane protein complex components. The GO EMC complex cellular-component term is the direct target.
    - [group] ER proteostasis|Protein transport|Transmembrane protein import
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0044743 protein transmembrane import into intracellular organelle]
        rationale: This PN group covers ER transmembrane-protein insertion/import systems such as EMC- and PAT-related pathways. The local GO cache does not expose an ER-specific matching term, so the broader intracellular-organelle transmembrane-import process is the best supported propagation target.
    - [class] ER proteostasis|Protein transport
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0015031 protein transport]
        rationale: The PN ER Protein transport class groups ER-targeting and ER-insertion pathways. GO protein transport is the appropriate propagation target, while the source class remains ER-specific and broader than any single GO transport subtype.
    - [branch] ER proteostasis
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a top-level PN branch. This is a systems/taxonomy umbrella, not a direct GO assertion; narrower child curations carry any propagating GO mappings.

## PN row 2: Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway | Autophagophore initiation and elongation | Class 3 PI3K complex 1, direct | Localization of class 3 PI3K complex 1
- UniProt: Q9BV81
- In branches: ER, ALP
- Notes: Transmembrane ER protein that localizes to omegasomes and interacts with BECN1 to recruit PI3K complex to autophagophore nucleation site.

- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [type] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagophore initiation and elongation|Class 3 PI3K complex 1, direct|Localization of class 3 PI3K complex 1
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0035032 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, class III]
        rationale: Reviewed as a class-III PI3K complex context or regulator bucket. This node is useful for curator interpretation, but it should not project cellular-component membership; only explicit complex-component leaves propagate to GO complex terms.
    - [group] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagophore initiation and elongation|Class 3 PI3K complex 1, direct
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0035032 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, class III]
        rationale: Reviewed as a class-III PI3K complex context or regulator bucket. This node is useful for curator interpretation, but it should not project cellular-component membership; only explicit complex-component leaves propagate to GO complex terms.
    - [class] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway|Autophagophore initiation and elongation
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0016236 macroautophagy]
        rationale: This class is a real macroautophagy context, but its descendants include core factors, component buckets, upstream modulators, localization roles, and residual categories. Projecting generic macroautophagy from this ancestor creates TRAPP-like overpropagation, so candidate GO annotations must come from narrower curated nodes.
    - [branch] Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level PN branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; all propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
