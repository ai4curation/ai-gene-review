## PN row 1: Ubiquitin Proteasome System | E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases | RING variant | PHD | other
- UniProt: O43918
- In branches: UPS
- Signature domains: IPR001965
- Auxiliary domains: (none)
- PN references (titles):
    - 14734522
    - 15150263
- PN-node mapping records (path + ancestors):
    - [subtype] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|RING variant|PHD|other
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower E3-ligase architecture, component, or domain subdivision already covered by the curated parent E3 mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [type] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|RING variant|PHD
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as a narrower E3-ligase architecture, component, or domain subdivision already covered by the curated parent E3 mapping. No additional direct GO mapping is needed at this node.
    - [group] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases|RING variant
        status=mapped scope=ok_for_propagation_to_go GO=[GO:0061630 ubiquitin protein ligase activity]
        rationale: This PN group is a catalytic ubiquitin E3 ligase bucket. The shared GO molecular-function target is ubiquitin protein ligase activity.
    - [class] Ubiquitin Proteasome System|E3 ubiquitin and UBL ligases
        status=context_only scope=too_broad_to_propagate GO=[GO:0061630 ubiquitin protein ligase activity]
        rationale: This class is a genuine E3-ligase context, but its descendants include catalytic ligases, cullin scaffolds, substrate receptors, adaptors, cofactors, regulators, and UBL modifier systems. A class-level propagation would over-annotate.
    - [branch] Ubiquitin Proteasome System
        status=no_mapping scope= GO=[]
        rationale: Reviewed as the top-level UPS branch. It is a project taxonomy umbrella rather than a direct GO assertion; UPS propagation must come from manually curated child nodes.
