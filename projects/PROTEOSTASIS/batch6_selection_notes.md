# Proteostasis Review Batch 6 — Gene Selection

Date: 2026-06-07
Branch: `claude/proteostasis-50-genes-xFOZK`

## Context

Batches 1–5 are complete (`pr-1217`, `2026-06-03`, `2026-06-06`, `2026-06-07`,
`2026-06-07b`). Batch 5 covered the cytosolic/ER chaperone & co-chaperone
folding machinery. Batch 6 moves to the **Translation branch**, selecting 50
unreviewed PN candidates (`ok_for_propagation_to_go` scope, no prior
`*-ai-review.yaml`).

## Theme: co-translational quality control & translation surveillance

This is the most proteostasis-central slice of the Translation branch — the
machinery that monitors translation, rescues stalled/collided ribosomes,
degrades aberrant nascent chains, surveils faulty mRNAs, and co-translationally
modifies emerging nascent chains. It complements the related
`RIBOSOME_QUALITY_CONTROL` and `INTEGRATED_STRESS_RESPONSE` projects.

### Deferred mega/pleiotropic genes

`HUWE1` (giant ~4374-aa E3 with hundreds of substrates) and `OGT`
(O-GlcNAc transferase, pervasively pleiotropic) were considered but deferred to
dedicated reviews rather than diluting this batch.

## Method

Same as batch 5: `fetch-gene --no-fetch-titles` scaffolding (with timeout
retries), per-annotation review against GO guidelines with verbatim
`supported_by`, populated `description`/`core_functions`/questions/experiments,
`uv run ai-gene-review validate`, then PN-mapping feedback.

## Curation watch-points

- **Avoid `protein binding` (GO:0005515)** as core; for E3s use
  `ubiquitin protein ligase activity`, for the rescue GTPases use translational
  GTPase / ribosome-binding terms, for Nat subunits use
  `N-terminal (peptidyl-)amino-acid acetyltransferase activity`.
- **Catalytic vs auxiliary subunits:** NatA/B/C auxiliary subunits (NAA15, NAA25,
  NAA35, NAA38) and HYPK are non-catalytic — do not assign acetyltransferase
  catalytic activity; use complex/adaptor/auxiliary terms.
- **RQC vs generic translation:** keep broad `translation` (GO:0006412) terms
  non-core where the gene's specific role is collided-ribosome surveillance /
  rescue / RQC (cf. the EDF1 precedent).
- **UFMylation enzyme roles:** assign the correct E1/E2/E3/protease step; UFM1 is
  the modifier, not an enzyme.
- **Moonlighting:** RACK1, EIF5A, NAA10 have well-documented non-RQC moonlighting
  roles — capture the core translation/QC function, mark over-annotations.

## Correction: USP21 / USP25 synonym collision

`fetch-gene human USP21` resolved to **USP25** (UniProt Q9UHP3, UBP25_HUMAN),
because UniProt lists `USP21` as a gene-name *synonym* of USP25. The review was
relabeled to USP25 (a legitimate ERAD-associated proteostasis DUB) and its folder
renamed `USP21/` -> `USP25/`. The **correct USP21** (Q9UK80, UBP21_HUMAN) was then
fetched explicitly by accession and reviewed separately. Batch 6 therefore covers
**51** genes (the 49 other selections + USP25 + USP21). Lesson: when a target gene
symbol is also a documented synonym of another gene, fetch by explicit UniProt
accession.
