          direct_prompt: |
            You are reviewing ARBA rules that were mentioned in the geneontology/go-annotation issue tracker.
            This indicates GO curators have raised concerns or questions about these rules.

            ARBA IDs to consider reviewing: ${{ needs.scan-arba-issues.outputs.arba_ids }}

            ## Your Task

            Pick a SINGLE unreviewed ARBA ID from the list above and review it.
            Review files are stored in `rules/arba/{ARBA_ID}/{ARBA_ID}-review.yaml`.
            if ALL of the IDs above are accounted for, you can end this task here.
            Otherwise, pick a single ID from the list above and review it.
            
            To analyze the rule, you MUST use the rule-reviewer subagent.
            
            When you are done, create a new PR in this repo with the changes to the rule.
            Include in the PR any additional references that were cached too.

            Summarize your findings in the PR description. Also search https://github.com/geneontology/go-annotation/issues
            for mentions of this ARBA ID, and link to the go-annotation issue in the PR description.
