stable_id: R-HSA-9816153
display_name: MYC,MYCN bind MIR9-3 gene locus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Genome-wide ChIP-on-chip experiments using the Kelly and SJ-NB-12 neuroblastoma
  cells, which express high levels of endogenous MYCN and MYC, respectively, due in
  both cases to gene amplification, showed that the endogenous MYCN and MYC proteins
  bound directly to a conserved CpG island region encompassing canonical MYC binding
  sites (CACGTG) in the MIR9-3 gene locus (Ma et al. 2010). Positive regulation of
  miR-9-3 expression by MYC was confirmed in human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293
  (Liu et al. 2013). MYC was also shown to be enriched on the promoter of the MIR9-1
  gene by ChIP in human fibroblast cell lines HFL-1 and MRC-5 and to stimulate miR-9-1
  expression in both mouse and human (Qin et al. 2022).
