species: Homo sapiens
summary: N-glycan side chains on the nascent SARS-CoV-1 spike protein get their terminal
  glucose moieties cleaved by ER glucosidases I and II, before folding. Iminosugars
  inhibit this process and are good candidates for broad-spectrum anivirals (Zhao

## Summary

N-glycan side chains on the nascent SARS-CoV-1 spike protein get their terminal glucose moieties cleaved by ER glucosidases I and II, before folding. Iminosugars inhibit this process and are good candidates for broad-spectrum anivirals (Zhao et al, 2015).
