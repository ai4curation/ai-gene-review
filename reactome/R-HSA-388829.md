display_name: SHP2 phosphatase binds CTLA-4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CTLA4 associates with the SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2,
  and this interaction is mediated through the phosphorylation of the YVKM motif on
  CTLA4. Upon phosphorylation of this motif, SHP-2 is recruited to CTLA4, where it
  plays a crucial role in negatively regulating T cell activation by directly dephosphorylating
  key signaling molecules, such as the CD3zeta chain and ZAP-70, in the T cell receptor
  (TCR) signaling cascade. However, the nature of the SHP-2 and CTLA4 interaction
  remains unclear and controversial, with several studies reporting that CTLA4 may
  not directly bind to SHP-2. Instead, the association between the phosphatase and
  CTLA4 could be an indirect event, possibly mediated by intermediaries like PI3-kinase,
  which might link SHP-2 to CTLA4 (Schneider and Rudd 2000).
