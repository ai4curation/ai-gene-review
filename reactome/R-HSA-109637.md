display_name: Binding of TFIIA and TFIIB to the pol II promoter:TFIID complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The general transcription factor TFIIB is a single polypeptide of approximately
  35 kDa.  There is a Zn-binding domain near the N terminus of TFIIB, and the C-terminal
  domain encompasses two imperfect repeats; between the N and C termini is a phylogenetically
  conserved region.  The C terminus interacts with TBP and RNA Polymerase II, whereas
  the N terminus interacts with factor TFIIF and RNA polymerase II.  TFIIB is a sequence-specific
  factor, and it interacts with the BRE element within the promoter.<p>TFIIB interacts
  with the Rpb1 subunit of RNA polymerase II to define transcription strat sites.  Several
  activators directly bind TFIIB, and stimulate transcription.  The N-terminus and
  the C-terminus can participate in intramolecular interactions, and this can be disrupted
  by specific activators  by causing a conformational change in TFIIB.<p> TFIIA also
  binds the preinitiation complex along with TFIIB.  However, TFIIA is not required
  for accurate initiation, but rather functions as a coactivator of transcription.
