stable_id: R-HSA-5655339
display_name: Activated FGFR2 mutants bind FRS2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After activation, FGFR mutants are presumed to recruit FRS2 (also known as
  FRS2alpha).  This has been demonstrated in some cases (see for instance Ahmed, 2008;
  Weiss, 2010; Dutt, 2008; Dutt, 2011; Cha, 2009; Qing, 2009; Bai, 2010 ) and is inferred
  to occur in others by analogy with the wild-type receptor.
