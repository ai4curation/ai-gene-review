display_name: Phosphorylation of STAT1 on tyrosine-701 is enhanced by p-S172-IKBKE
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylated IKBKE (IKKepsilon) positively regulates the phosphorylation
  of STAT1 on tyrosine-701 in response to low shear flow stress (Zhu et al. 2020,
  Lv et al. 2024). IKBKE is a serine kinase (Tenoever et al. 2007) rather than a tyrosine
  kinase, therefore the effect of IKBKE on tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 is probably
  indirect.
