stable_id: R-HSA-9011748
display_name: IL9R binds JAK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-9 receptor (IL9R) binds Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1);
  this association is believed to be constitutive (Demoulin et al. 1996, Zhu et al
  1997). The association is ascribed to a 98-residue juxta-membrane region within
  the BOX1 motif of the receptor that contains a Pro-X-Pro sequence preceded by a
  cluster of hydrophobic residues, a consensus sequence shared by many other cytokine
  receptors e.g. IL4R, IL7R, IL3R (Murakami et al. 1991, Zhu et al 1997).
