display_name: Loss-of-function NF1 variants don't stimulate RAS GTPase activity
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NF1 is a RAS GTPase activating protein (GAP) that promotes the conversion
  of the active RAS:GTP to the inactive RAS:GDP form (reviewed in King et al, 2013).  Germline
  loss-of-function mutations in NF1 are associated with neurofibromatosis 1, an autosomal
  dominant disorder that causes aberrant activation of the RAS signaling pathway (reviewed
  in Tidyman and Rauen, 2009).  More recently, somatic loss-of-function mutations
  in NF1 have been identified in a number of cancers such as glioblastoma, lung adenocarcinoma,
  breast and ovarian cancers, leukemia and neuroblastoma, making NF1 a tumor suppressor
  (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008; Parsons et al, 2008; McGillicuddy et
  al, 2009; Ding et al, 2008; The et al, 1993; Holzel et al, 2010; Maertens et al,
  2013; Whittaker et al, 2013; reviewed in Maertens and Cichowski, 2014).  Cancer-associated
  lesions in the NF1 gene range from homozygous deletions of the entire gene to missense
  or frameshift mutations that truncate and destabilize the protein; these variant
  alleles are often expressed at very low levels or not at all and where examined,
  most cells appear to have compromised GAP activities (Basu et al, 1992; De CLue
  et al, 1992; Bollag et al, 1996; Klose et al, 1998; Updahyaya et al, 1997; Krauthammer
  et al, 2015; Nissan et al, 2014; Thomas et al, 2012; reviewed in Maertens and Cichowski,
