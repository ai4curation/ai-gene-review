stable_id: R-HSA-3928595
display_name: N-WASP binds ARP2/3 and G-actin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASL, N-WASP) is activated
  its VCA region becomes available for binding to actin-related protein (ARP2/3) complex
  and actin monomer. The actin monomer binds to the V-domain and ARP2/3 complex binds
  to the CA-domain. The simultaneous binding of G-actin and the ARP2/3 complex to
  the VCA region contributes to the activation of ARP2/3-complex-mediated actin polymerization
  (Takenawa & Suetsugu 2007). Actin polymerization via N-WASP and the ARP2/3 complex
  leads to spherical expansion of dendritic spine heads.
