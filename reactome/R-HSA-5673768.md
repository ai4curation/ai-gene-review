stable_id: R-HSA-5673768
display_name: p-AMPK:AMP phosphorylates Raptor in the MTORC1 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: When cellular energy is depleted, the active AMPK complex (bound to AMPK,
  AMPK alpha phosphorylated on Thr-172 or Thr-174) phosphorylates the mTORC1 component
  RPTOR (Raptor) on Ser-722 and Ser-792. These phosphorylations are required for inhibition
  of mTORC1 activity in response to energy stress (Gwinn et al. 2008), and are believed
  to promote the dissociation of mTORC1 from the ULK1 complex (Wong et al. 2013).
  This reduces mTORC1 phosphorylation of ULK1 Ser-758, which consequently is able
  to associate with, and be activated by, AMPK (Egan et al. 2011). This coordinated
  phosphorylation of ULK1 by mTORC1 and AMPK may provide a mechanism by which cells
  can properly respond to a wide range of stimuli.
