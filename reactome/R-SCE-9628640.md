display_name: SBH1:GET3:ADP:GET1:GET2 dissociates yielding SBH1 in the endoplasmic
  reticulum membrane
species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
summary: GET3:ADP docks with GET4:WDY2 (GET4:GET5), resulting in a conformational
  change in GET3 that causes release of the tail-anchored protein from GET3 to GET1
  (Stefer et al. 2011, Wang et al. 2011, Kubota et al. 2012, Wang et al. 2014, Zalisko
  et al. 2017), The GET1:GET2 complex inserts the tail-anchored protein into the endoplasmic
  reticulum membrane (Schuldiner et al. 2008, Wang et al. 2011, Wang et al. 2014).
  Release of ADP and binding of ATP by GET3 then recycles GET3 back into the cytosol
  (Wang et al. 2011, Zalisko et al. 2017).

## Summary

GET3:ADP docks with GET4:WDY2 (GET4:GET5), resulting in a conformational change in GET3 that causes release of the tail-anchored protein from GET3 to GET1 (Stefer et al. 2011, Wang et al. 2011, Kubota et al. 2012, Wang et al. 2014, Zalisko et al. 2017), The GET1:GET2 complex inserts the tail-anchored protein into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Schuldiner et al. 2008, Wang et al. 2011, Wang et al. 2014). Release of ADP and binding of ATP by GET3 then recycles GET3 back into the cytosol (Wang et al. 2011, Zalisko et al. 2017).
