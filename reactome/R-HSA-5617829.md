display_name: Assembly of IFT A complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The IFT A complex is believed to be composed of six components: WDR19/IFT144,
  IFT140, IFT122, TTC21B/IFT139, WDR35/IFT121 and IFT43 (Piperno et al, 1998; Cole
  and Snell, 2009; reviewed in Taschner et al, 2012). Each of these proteins was identified
  as a TULP3-interacting protein in human cells, supporting the notion established
  in other organisms that they are all components of the IFT A complex (Mukhopadhyay
  et al, 2010; reviewed in Taschner et al, 2012). The IFT A proteins are large and
  generally have similar domain organization, consisting of N-terminal WD motifs and
  C-terminal TPR repeats. These protein interaction domains may help the IFT A complex
  scaffold recruitment of the IFT B complex, as well as recruit ciliary cargo and
  motor proteins. Intriguingly, the domain structure of IFT A proteins is similar
  to that of nucleoporins and coat proteins and it has been suggested that they evolved
  from a coat protein precursor, consistent with a role in vesicle trafficking (Devos
  et al, 2004; Jekely and Arendt, 2006).<br>Details of protein-protein interactions
  within the IFT A complex are not known, nor are the details of how and where the
