stable_id: R-HSA-6809680
display_name: MTMR12 binds MTM1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MTM1 forms a complex with MTMR12 (3 PAP), an enzymatically inactive myotubularin
  family member. MTMR12 promotes MTM1 recruitment to cytosolic vesicular structures,
  presumably early or late endosomes. Complex formation stabilizes both MTM1 and MTMR12
  proteins (Caldwell et al. 1991, Nandurkar et al. 2003, Gupta et al. 2013).
