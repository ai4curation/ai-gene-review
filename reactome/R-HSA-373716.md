stable_id: R-HSA-373716
display_name: DCC interacting NCK-1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DCC interacts with the SH3/SH2 adaptor NCK1 in commissural neurons. This
  interaction is direct and requires the SH3 but not SH2 domains of NCK1. NCK1 can
  recruit Rac, Cdc42 and their effectors Pak and N-WASP to the activated receptor,
  thereby providing a direct link between DCC, Rho GTPases and numerous downstream
  signaling components that regulate the actin cytoskeleton.
