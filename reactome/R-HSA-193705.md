display_name: IKKbeta phosphorylates IkB causing NF-kB to dissociate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IkB is an inhibitory protein that sequesters NF-kB in the cytoplasm, by masking
  a nuclear localization signal, located just at the C-terminal end in each of the
  NF-kB subunits. A key event in NF-kB activation involves phosphorylation of IkB
  by an IkB kinase (IKK). NGF stimulates the activity of the IkB kinase IKK-beta,
  and, possibly, IKK-alpha as well. Once IkB is phosphorylated, the IkB:NF-kB complex
  dissociates.
