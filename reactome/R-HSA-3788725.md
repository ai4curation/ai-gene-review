stable_id: R-HSA-3788725
display_name: Cdh1:APC/C complex binds EHMT1:EHMT2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cdh1 (FZR1) is able to bind both G9a (EHMT2) and GLP (EHMT1) (Takahashi et
  al. 2012). EHMT1 and EHMT2 histone methyltransferases were shown to function as
  a heterodimer in vivo (Tachibana et al. 2005).
