display_name: Expression of ATP5B
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ATP5B (ATP synthase beta subunit) gene is transcribed in the nucleus
  to yield mRNA and the mRNA is translated in the cytosol to yield the ATP5B precursor,
  which is then imported into the mitochondrial matrix. ATP5B is a peripheral membrane
  protein located at the matrix face of the inner membrane within the ATP synthase
  complex (reviewed in Leyva et al. 2003).

## Summary

The ATP5B (ATP synthase beta subunit) gene is transcribed in the nucleus to yield mRNA and the mRNA is translated in the cytosol to yield the ATP5B precursor, which is then imported into the mitochondrial matrix. ATP5B is a peripheral membrane protein located at the matrix face of the inner membrane within the ATP synthase complex (reviewed in Leyva et al. 2003).
