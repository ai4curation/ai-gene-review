stable_id: R-HSA-452097
display_name: Recruited STAT5 is phosphorylated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT5 alpha and beta are recruited to the receptor complex and phosphorylated.
  JAK3 is believed to be responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in
  response to IL-2;  it is not clear whether JAK1 is also involved (Lin & Leonard,
  2000). Tyr-694 of STAT5a and Tyr-699 of STAT5b are required for IL-2 induced STAT5
  activation (Lin et al. 1996).  STAT5a and STAT5b are also known to be serine phosphorylated
  in lymphocytes activated by IL-2 but the funtion of this is unclear (Xue et al.
  2002).
