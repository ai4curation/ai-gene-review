display_name: 'Recruitment of XPA and release of CAK '
species: Homo sapiens
summary: XPA binds the DNA damage site through interaction with the TFIIH complex
  subunit GTF2H5 (TTDA) (Ziani et al. 2014), and also interacts with the DDB2 subunit
  of the UV-DDB complex (Wakasugi et al. 2001, Wakasugi et al. 2009, Takedachi et
  al. 2010). PARylated PARP1 (or possibly PARP2) (King et al. 2012) facilitates XPA
  association with chromatin. Binding of XPA is accompanied by the release of the
  CAK subcomplex from the TFIIH complex (Coin et al. 2008).
