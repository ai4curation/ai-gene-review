stable_id: R-HSA-481007
display_name: Exocytosis of platelet alpha granule contents
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Alpha granules contain mainly polypeptides such as fibrinogen, von Willebrand
  factor, growth factors and protease inhibitors that supplement thrombin generation
  at the site of injury. In addtion to their role in hemostasis, platelets also contain
  angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitors (Italiano et al. 2008).
