display_name: CD151 interacts with BP180 and the integrin alpha 6 subunit
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CD151 interacts with  the extracellular domain of the integrin alpha 6  subunit.
  CD151 is thought to play a role in the formation and stability of hemidesmosomes
  by providing a framework for the spatial organization of the hemidesmosomal components
  (Sterk  et al., 2000).
