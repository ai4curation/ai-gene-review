display_name: EGR2 and SREBF2(1-484) dimer bind HMGCR gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HMG coenzyme A reductase catalyzes a rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis
  and is expressed in a SREBF2- and EGR2-dependent manner during Schwann cell myelination.
  Cognate binding sites for both SREBF2 and EGR2 have been identified in the promoter
  of HMGCR, and the transcription factors act synergistically to promote transcription
  (Pai et al, 1998; Nagarajan et al, 2001; Verheijen et al, 2003; LeBlanc et al, 2005;
  Jang et al, 2010).

## Summary

HMG coenzyme A reductase catalyzes a rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis and is expressed in a SREBF2- and EGR2-dependent manner during Schwann cell myelination. Cognate binding sites for both SREBF2 and EGR2 have been identified in the promoter of HMGCR, and the transcription factors act synergistically to promote transcription (Pai et al, 1998; Nagarajan et al, 2001; Verheijen et al, 2003; LeBlanc et al, 2005; Jang et al, 2010).
