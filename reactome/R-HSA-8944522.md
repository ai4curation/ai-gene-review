stable_id: R-HSA-8944522
display_name: miR-19a microRNA binds PTEN mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA miR-19a-3p, one of the two mature products of miR-19a, binds the
  3'UTR of PTEN mRNA (Xiao et al. 2008, Poliseno, Salmena, Riccardi et al. 2010).
  miR-19a microRNA causes reduction in both PTEN mRNA and protein levels and is thus
  shown to function as a part of the endonucleolytic RISC. It is possible that miR-19a
  microRNA also functions as a part of the nonendonucleolytic RISC.
