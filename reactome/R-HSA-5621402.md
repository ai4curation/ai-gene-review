species: Homo sapiens
summary: Ceruloplasmin (CP), synthesised in the liver and secreted into plasma, is
  a copper-binding (6-7 atoms per molecule) glycoprotein involved in iron trafficking
  in vertebrates. CP is essential for SLC40A1 (ferroportin) stability at the cell
  surface, the protein that mediates iron efflux from cells. CP also possesses ferroxidase
  activity, which oxidises ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+) following its
  transfer out of the cell. Defects in CP (or indeed SLC40A1) can lead to the phenotype
  of iron overload as seen in the disorder aceruloplasminemia (ACERULOP; MIM:604290).
  It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism characterised by iron
  accumulation mainly in the brain, but also in liver, pancreas and retina. Patients
  develop retinal degeneration, diabetes mellitus and neurological disturbance.<br><br>Mutations
  that can cause ACERULOP include W858*, E797Rfs*12, D411Tfs*36 and 778fs*12 (Takahashi
