species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-23 (IL23) induces Signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) and STAT4 phosphorylation. Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase TYK2 (TYK2)
  and Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2 (JAK2) are believed to phosphorylate STAT3 and
  STAT4 (Parham et al. 2002). STAT3 is the most prominent STAT activated by IL23,
  contrasting with Interleukin-12 (IL12) which predominantly induces STAT4 activation
  (Parham et al. 2002). IL23 induces phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT4 in NK-like
  T cells but neither in NK cells (van de Wetering et al. 2009). Phosphorylation results
  in STAT3:STAT4 heterodimer formation (Parham et al. 2002). <br>This is a black box
  event because the exact mechanism and order of STAT3/STAT4 binding is unknown.
