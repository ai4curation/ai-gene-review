stable_id: R-HSA-9925320
display_name: CD274 mRNA binds miR-142-5p RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA-142 (miR-142) plays a crucial role in regulating the development,
  stability, and function of regulatory T cells. The miR-142-3p variant specifically
  modulates regulatory T cell balance and immune tolerance by reducing IFNγ responses.
  Primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells, miR-142 produces two main mature miRNAs,
  miR-142-5p and miR-142-3p, originating from opposite strands of the miR-142 precursor’s
  hairpin structure (Wang et al., 2022). miR-142-5p also plays a key role in the regulation
  of CD274 (PD-L1) expression by targeting 3’UTR of PDL1 mRNA. Using luciferase assays
  with a CD274 (PD-L1) 3' UTR reporter in pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1) (Jia
  et al.,2017) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines (HepG2 and Huh7) (Jiang
  et al.,2021), it was confirmed reduced reporter activity upon miR0142 mimic transfection.
  The study demonstrates direct association of miR-142 with PD-L1 mRNA and suppression
  of PD-L1 expression.
