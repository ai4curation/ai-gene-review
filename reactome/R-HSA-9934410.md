display_name: CDH1 forms homotypic trans-dimers
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CDH1 (E-cadherin) forms a homotypic trans-complex with CDH1 presented on
  the plasma membrane of a neighbouring cell, where two CDH1 molecules interact through
  their extracellular domains in a calcium (Ca2+)-dependent manner and catenin-dependent
  manner (Chitaev and Troyanovski 1998). Based on a structural study using the extracellular
  domain of the mouse CDH1, it was determined that twelve Ca2+ ions per CDH1 molecule
  were needed for homotypic dimerization (Nagar et al. 1996). Another study with the
  mouse CDH1 reported that nine Ca2+ ions per CDH1 molecule were needed for homotypic
  dimerization (Koch et al. 1997). Using super-resolution microscopy techniques it
  was found that loosely organized cis-clusters of approximately five CDH1 molecules
  serve as the precursors of trans-ligated adhesive clusters, consisting of homotypic
  trans-dimers, that make up the adherens junction (Wu et al. 2015; reviewed in Zhang
  et al. 2023). CDH1 clusters in both interacting cells are surrounded by the cytosolic
  F-actin meshwork, but the F-actin meshwork is not necessary for the establishment
  of homotypic trans-interactions (Wu et al. 2015).
