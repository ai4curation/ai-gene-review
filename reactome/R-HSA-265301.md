species: Homo sapiens
summary: Corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH) is a 39-amino acid polypeptide
  hormone produced and secreted by the pituitary gland. It is often produced in response
  to biological stress (along with corticotropin-releasing hormone). Its principal
  effects are increased production of androgens and cortisol. Corticotropin is processed
  from the precursor pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). The enzyme that performs the cleavage
  of POMC to corticotropin is prohormone convertase 1 (PC1). In addition to corticotropin,
  POMC is processed into other small, biologically active fragments. These include
  lipotropins, melanocyte-stimulating hormone and endorphins.
