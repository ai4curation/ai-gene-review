stable_id: R-HSA-9766687
display_name: SESN1,SESN1 bind SQSTM1 and KEAP1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SESN1 and SESN2 are proteins with roles in oxidative stress response. Both
  SESN1 and SESN2 interact with SQSTM1 in the context of a KEAP1:CUL3:RBX1 complex
  to promote the degradation of KEAP1 by selective autophagy (Bae et al, 2013; Ro
  et al, 2014). SESN1 and SESN2 may increase the binding affinity of SQSTM1 for its
  KEAP1 substrate (Bae et al, 2013).
