summary: 'The histone acetyltransferase KAT6A, which functions as part of the MOZ/MORF
  complex (Ullah et al. 2008), associates with TP53 (p53) and PML (Rokudai et al.
  2013). KAT6A can independently associate with TP53 and PML, but the presence of
  PML enhances KAT6A-mediated acetylation of TP53. Phosphorylation of KAT6A by activated
  AKT inhibits PML binding (Rokudai et al. 2013). '

## Summary

The histone acetyltransferase KAT6A, which functions as part of the MOZ/MORF complex (Ullah et al. 2008), associates with TP53 (p53) and PML (Rokudai et al. 2013). KAT6A can independently associate with TP53 and PML, but the presence of PML enhances KAT6A-mediated acetylation of TP53. Phosphorylation of KAT6A by activated AKT inhibits PML binding (Rokudai et al. 2013).
