stable_id: R-HSA-5625421
display_name: The anterograde IFT train dissociates
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Based on work done in C. reinhardtii and Trypanosoma brucei, anterograde
  IFT trains are believed to disassemble at the ciliary tip, releasing cargo and the
  IFT motors.  Smaller retrograde trains are subsequently reassembled for transport
  back to the ciliary base (Iomini et al, 2001; Buisson et al, 2013; Pigino et al,
  2009; reviewed in Ishikawa et al, 2011; Bhogaraju et al, 2013). A direct interaction
  between IFT27 and the nucleotide-free form of ARL6 may contribute to ARL6 activation
  and in this way contribute to ciliary exit of some cargo (Liew et al, 2014).
