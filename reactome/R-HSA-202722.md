stable_id: R-HSA-202722
display_name: CD48 binds CD244
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'CD2, CD48, CD84, CD244 and CD58 have a similar extracellular domain arichitecture
  consisting of two IgSF domains. CD244 is closely related to CD84 in having a long
  cytoplasmic tail with tyrosine-based motifs (TxYxxI/V) resembling immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). CD2 has a cytoplasmic domain with proline-rich
  regions which recruit an Src homology 3 (SH3)- containing protein called CD2-associated
  protein (CD2AP). CD48 is glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anchored to the membrane.<p>


  CD244 is known to be activated by binding to CD48 in humans. '
