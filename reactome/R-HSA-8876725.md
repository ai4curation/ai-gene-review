display_name: Protein methylation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Methylation of lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg) residues on non-histone proteins
  is a prevalent post-translational modification and important regulator of cellular
  signal transduction pathways including MAPK, WNT, BMP, Hippo and JAK–STAT. Crosstalk
  between methylation and other types of post-translational modifications and between
  histone and non-histone protein methylation is frequent, affecting cellular functions
  such as chromatin remodelling, gene transcription, protein synthesis, signal transduction
  and DNA repair (Biggar & Li 2015).
