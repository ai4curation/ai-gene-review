display_name: Active transport of ubiquitinated CD274 from ER to cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ERAD complex consists of ATPases like VCP responsible for ER to cytosol
  translocation of abnormally glycosylated proteins. Abnormally glycosylated PD-L1
  is also translocated to the cytosol by the ERAD complex for further ubiquitination
  and degradation by the 26S proteasome (Cha et al., 2018).
