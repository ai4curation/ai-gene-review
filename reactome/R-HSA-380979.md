stable_id: R-HSA-380979
display_name: RHEB in mTORC1:RHEB:GTP hydrolyses GTP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TSC2 (in the TSC complex) functions as a GTPase-activating protein and stimulates
  the intrinsic GTPase activity of the small G-protein Rheb. This results in the conversion
  of Rheb:GTP to Rheb:GDP. GDP-bound Rheb is unable to activate mTOR (Inoki et al.
  2003, Tee et al. 2003). It is not demonstrated that RHEB hydrolyzes GTP when present
  in the mTORC1 complex; given the low affinity of RHEB for mTOR, it may dissociate
  from the mTORC1 complex before TSC2 stimulates hydrolysis of GTP; TSC2 may not have
  access to critical residues of RHEB when present inside mTORC1.
