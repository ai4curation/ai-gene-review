display_name: ZEB1 recruits MPHOSPH8 (MPP8) to CDH1 gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MPHOSPH8 (also known as M-phase phosphoprotein 8 or MPP8) binds to the CDH1
  gene promoter and represses CDH1 gene expression (Kokura et al. 2010). Binding of
  MPHOSPH8 to the CDH1 gene promoter is ZEB1 dependent (Sun et al. 2015). MPHOSPH8
  was shown to recruit histone deacetylase SIRT1 to ZEB1 at the CDH1 gene promoter,
  resulting in histone deacetylation, which contributes to CDH1 gene repression (Sun
  et al. 2015). As MPHOSPH8 binds to histones methylated at H3K9, it is likely that
  methylation of the CDH1 gene promoter by a histone methyltransferase precedes the
  recruitment of MPHOSPH8 (Kokura et al. 2010, Sun et al. 2015).
