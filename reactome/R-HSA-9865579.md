display_name: MT-CO1 and MT-CO2 complexes associate, installing heme moieties
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Both MT-CO1 and MT-CO2 pre-assembly complexes bind together, simultaneously
  installing heme moieties and associating with the COX7B, COX7C, and COX8A subunits.
  The assembly of catalytic metal redox centers (heme and copper) at MT-CO1 and MT-CO2
  subunits of Complex IV must be coordinated because the accumulation of heme-containing
  Complex IV assembly intermediates lacking copper induces oxidative-stress mediated
  cytotoxicity. A dynamic metallochaperone complex involving the heme A biosynthetic
  enzymes COX10 and COX15, together with COX2-specific copper chaperones COA6, SCO1,
  and SCO2, catalyzes the insertion of two heme molecules into the MT-CO1 subunit,
  and one heme into the MT-CO2 subunit (Pacheu-Grau et al., 2015; Nývltová et al.,
  2022; reviewed in Čunátová et al., 2020; Rivett et al., 2021). The exact mechanism
  remains unclear, but the SURF1 subunit of MITRAC may act as an additional chaperone,
  for which there is evidence in bacterial models (Smith et al., 2005; Bundschuh et
  al., 2009). Mutations in SURF1 lead to complex IV deficiency (Zhu et al., 1998).
