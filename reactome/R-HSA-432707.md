display_name: trans-Golgi Network Lysosomal Vesicle Scission
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Dynamin is recruited to the growing lysosome destined vesicle and, under
  conditions that interfere with its GTPase activity, dynamin forms a collar or ring
  around the neck of the budding vesicle. It is unclear whether dynamin acts as a
  mechanochemical transducer to generate fission or as a recruiter to attach other
  proteins that are directly responsible for the fission step. Lipid-modifying enzymes
  such as endophilin are also involved in vesicle formation. Endophilin is an acyltransferase
  that interacts with dynamin and that generates lysophosphatidic acid. The current
  view is that this reaction produces a negative curvature at the neck of the vesicle.
