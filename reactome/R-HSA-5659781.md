display_name: BRCA1 forms a heterodimer with BARD1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BRCA1 and BARD1 form a stable heterodimer through an interaction between
  sequences encompassing their N-terminal RING domains (Wu et al. 1996, Brzovic et
  al. 2001). In addition to the RING domains, BRCA1 and BARD1 both have tandem BRCT
  motifs at their C termini. The central region of BARD1 contains ankyrin repeats
  (Wu et al. 1996). Formation of BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimers is necessary for the repair
  of double-strand DNA breaks by homologous recombination (Westermark et al. 2003,
  Laufer et al. 2007), BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression (Shakya et al. 2008) and normal
  development (McCarthy et al. 2003). Tumorigenic BRCA1 mutations that abolish the
  formation of BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimers have been reported (Wu et al. 1996, Brzovic
  et al. 2001).
