summary: NEDD4-binding protein 1 (N4BP1) negatively regulates Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced
  activation of NF-kappaB and cytokine production in human and mouse cells (Shi H
  et al. 2021; Gitlin AD et al. 2020). N4BP1 was found to target IKBKG (NEMO, IKKg),
  the regulatory subunit of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, which is essential for NF-kappa-B
  activation. N4BP1 co-immunoprecipitated with IKBKG (NEMO) upon co-expression of
  tagged proteins in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells (Shi H et al. 2021).
  The interaction between endogenous N4BP1 and IKBKG was also detected in mouse peritoneal
  macrophages (Shi H et al. 2021). Linear and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains promoted
  the interaction between N4BP1 and IKBKG. Binding of N4BP1 to IKBKG is thought to
  block homooligomerization of IKBKG thereby leading to destabilization of the IKK
  complex (Shi H et al. 2021). In addition, N4BP1 deficiency in mice and mouse cells
  increased the production of select NF-kappa-B-dependent cytokines via TICAM1 (TRIF)-independent
  TLR2, TLR7 or TLR9 signaling pathways, but not upon engagement of TLR3 or TLR4 which
  utilize the adaptor protein TICAM1 (Shi H et al. 2021; Gitlin AD et al. 2020). Similar
  results were observed in human monocytic THP-1 cells (Shi H et al. 2021). Further,
  TLR3- or TRL4-induced TICAM1-dependent activation of caspase-8 (CASP8) was found
  to inactivate N4BP1 via the proteolytic cleavage thus promoting NF-kappa-B activation
  (Gitlin AD et al. 2020; Shi H et al. 2021). Downregulation of N4BP1 was not observed
  in TICAM-1-deficient mouse macrophages treated with LPS (Shi H et al. 2021). These
  data suggest that N4BP1 limits TICAM1-independent TLR-induced NF-kappa-B activation
  by blocking the function of the IKK complex, while TICAM1-dependent TLR signaling
  leads to CASP8-mediated inactivation of N4BP1(Shi H et al. 2021; Gitlin AD et al.
  2020).
