display_name: Autophosphorylation of insulin receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Receptor autophosphorylation requires a lysine at position 1057 to stabilize
  the gamma phosphate of ATP. The adenosine of ATP interacts with three glycines at
  residues 1030-1035. The first tyrosine residues to be autophosphorylated are 1185,
  1189 and 1190 in the kinase domain. This is followed by 999 in the juxtamembrane
  domain, 1355 and 1361. These tyrosines fall into the three distinct tyrosine phosphorylation
  domains of the beta-subunit. In total there are 13 potential tyrosines that may
  be phosphorylated. The receptor phosphorylates itself in a trans rather than cis
  manner, where the beta-subunits phosphorylate each other rather than themselves
  (Tavaré et al. 1998).
