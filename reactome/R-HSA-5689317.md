summary: Once an open bubble structure is generated in damaged dsDNA through a DNA
  helicase activity of the TFIIH complex, the RPA heterotrimer composed of RPA1, RPA2
  and RPA3, coats the undamaged single strand DNA (ssDNA) (de Laat et al. 1998), thereby
  protecting it from incision and enabling the correct positioning of the NER endonucleases.
  The interaction of RPA with XPA facilitates RPA recruitment to the global genome
  nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) site (He et al. 1995, Ikegami et al. 1998).
  A DNA endonuclease ERCC5 (XPG) is recruited to the GG-NER site, 3' to the DNA damage,
  through its interaction with the TFIIH complex (Dunand-Sauthier et al. 2005, Zotter
  et al. 2006, Ito et al. 2007) and the RPA heterotrimer (de Laat et al. 1998).
