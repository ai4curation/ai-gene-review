summary: 'After passing through the Golgi complex, secretory cargo is packaged into
  post-Golgi transport intermediates (post-Golgi), which translocate plus-end directed
  along microtubules to the plasma membrane.

  There at least two classes of clathrin coated vesicles in cells, one predominantly
  Golgi-associated, involved in budding from the trans-Golgi network and the other
  at the plasma membrane. Here the clathrin-coated vesicles emerging from the Golgi
  apparatus are triggered by the heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex, AP-1 at
  the trans-Golgi network membrane. The cargo can be transmembrane, membrane associated
  or golgi luminal proteins. Each step in the vesicle sculpting pathway, gathers cargo
  and clathrin triskeletons, until a complete vesicular sphere is formed. With the
  scission of the membrane the vesicle is released and eventually losses its clathrin
  coat.'
