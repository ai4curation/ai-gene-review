display_name: ERCC5 and RPA bind TC-NER site
species: Homo sapiens
summary: It has been suggested that, similar to the UvrD helicase involved in TC-NER
  in E.coli, the DNA helicase activity of TFIIH complex may facilitate damage-stalled
  RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) backtracking (Epshtein et al. 2014). RNA Pol II backtracking,
  together with the cleavage of the 3' protruding end of nascent mRNA, might promote
  the movement of the transcription bubble away from the transcription-coupled nucleotide
  excision repair (TC-NER) site, while an open bubble is created (Sarker et al. 2005,
  Hanawalt and Spivak 2008). Once the open bubble is generated, the RPA heterotrimer
  composed of RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3 coats the undamaged single strand DNA (ssDNA) (de
  Laat et al. 1998), thereby protecting it from endonucleases. The interaction of
  RPA with XPA facilitates RPA recruitment to the nucleotide excision repair (NER)
  site (He et al. 1995, Ikegami et al. 1998). A DNA endonuclease ERCC5 (XPG) is recruited
  to the TC-NER site through its interaction with the stalled RNA Pol II (Sarker et
  al. 2005), the TFIIH complex (Dunand-Sauthier et al. 2005, Zotter et al. 2006, Ito
  et al. 2007) and the RPA heterotrimer (de Laat et al. 1998).
