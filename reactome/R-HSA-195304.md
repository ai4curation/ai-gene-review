display_name: Association of beta-catenin with the destruction complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Beta-catenin associates with the destruction complex through an interaction
  with Axin and or APC. This association may also involve interactions with the 15
  aa repeats in APC (Spink et al., 2001) or  the third APC 20aa repeat and its N-terminal
  flanking residues (Ha et al., 2004, Xing et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006).
