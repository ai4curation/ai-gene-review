stable_id: R-HSA-9866253
display_name: apo-UQCRFS1 binds LYRM7
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After its synthesis in the cytosol and via to the mitochondrial matrix following
  the TOM and TIM23 pathway, the Complex III subunit UQCRFS1 (Rieske protein) binds
  to and is stabilized by the chaperone LYRM7 (MZM1L) (Sanchez et al., 2012; Maio
  et al., 2017; Fernandez-Vizarra & Zeviani, 2018). Defects in LYRM7 lead to Complex
  III deficiency, manifesting in early-onset leukencephalopathy (reviewed in Alfattal
  et al., 2023).
