display_name: Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3 by IL6 receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-6 (IL6) activates the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs (Akira
  et al. 1994, Zhong et al. 1994) by receptor-associated JAKs (Hemmann et al. 1996)
  at a site that is essential for dimerization. For STAT1 this is tyrosine-701, for
  STAT3 tyrosine-705 (Kaptein et al. 1996, Shuai et al. 1994). Tyrosine phosphorylation
  leads to homo- or heterodimerization and translocation to the nucleus (Zhong et
  al. 1994), where the dimers bind to enhancers of IL6- inducible genes  e.g. acute
  phase protein genes, resulting in transcriptional activation.
