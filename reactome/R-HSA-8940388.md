stable_id: R-HSA-8940388
display_name: GPLD1 hydrolyses GPI-anchors from proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Some proteins function at the cell's surface, attached to the plasma membrane
  via GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchors and include enzymes, receptors, cell
  adhesion molecules and antigens. These GPI-anchored proteins participate in many
  important cellular functions including immune recognition, complement regulation
  and intracellular signaling. Phosphatidylinositol-glycan-specific phospholipase
  D (GPLD1) (Schofield et al. 2000) is a secreted protein that specifically cleaves
  GPI-anchored proteins by cleaving the linkage between the phosphate and inositol
  in GPI (Davitz et al. 1987, Low & Prasad 1988). In addition, it also localises to
  the ER where it can cleave GPI anchor intermediates transiting to the plasma membrane
  (not shown here). GPLD1 may play a role in the regulation of GPI-anchored proteins
  on (intra)cellular membranes.
