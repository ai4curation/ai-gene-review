display_name: POMP binds the 20S core particle outer ring
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'POMP (UMP1), proteasome maturation protein which may function as a homotetramer
  (Hoefer et al. 2006), binds the formed outer ring (Hirano et al. 2006). Binding
  of POMP to the outer ring is mutually exclusive with binding of PSMG3:PSMG4 dimer
  to the outer ring (Hirano et al. 2006), although a transient interaction between
  PSMG3:PSMG4 and POMP was detected by the analysis of 20S core particle intermediates
  (Adolf et al. 2024). Dissociation of PSMG3 from the outer ring during formation
  of half-proteasomes was reported in human cells (Hirano et al. 2006) and shown to
  happen after the incorporation of beta-3 (PSMB3) (Hirano et al. 2008). POMP initiates
  the assembly of the inner ring. Beta subunits (PSMBs) of the inner ring assemble
  onto the inner surface of outer ring. POMP may help prevent the premature dimerization
  of precursors containing incomplete sets of beta subunits (reviewed in Tomko and
  Hochstrasser 2013). '

## Summary

POMP (UMP1), proteasome maturation protein which may function as a homotetramer (Hoefer et al. 2006), binds the formed outer ring (Hirano et al. 2006). Binding of POMP to the outer ring is mutually exclusive with binding of PSMG3:PSMG4 dimer to the outer ring (Hirano et al. 2006), although a transient interaction between PSMG3:PSMG4 and POMP was detected by the analysis of 20S core particle intermediates (Adolf et al. 2024).
