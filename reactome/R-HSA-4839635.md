display_name: CTNNB1 S37 mutants aren't phosphorylated by GSK3beta
species: Homo sapiens
summary: S37 mutations of beta-catenin interfere with GSK3 phosphorylation and stabilize
  the protein, resulting in enhanced WNT pathway signaling (Nhieu et al, 1999; Clements
  et al, 2002; reviewed in Polakis, 2000).  S37 mutations have been identified in
  cancers of the brain, liver, ovary and large intestine, among others (reviewed in
  Polakis, 2000).
