display_name: Removal of RNA primer and dissociation of RPA and Dna2 from the C-strand
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The DNA2 endonuclease removes the initiator RNA along with several downstream
  deoxyribonucleotides. The cleavage of the single-stranded RNA substrate results
  in the disassembly of RPA and DNA2. The current data for the role of the DNA2 endonuclease
  has been derived from studies of yeast (Budd et al. 2000, Bae et al. 2001) and Xenopus
  DNA2 (Liu et al. 2000, Liao et al. 2008). DNA2-mediated cleavage of G-quadruplexes
  (G4), DNA structures commonly formed by polyguanine-rich telomeric DNA sequences,
  is necessary for completion of telomeric DNA synthesis (Masuda-Sasa et al. 2008,
  Lin et al. 2013).
