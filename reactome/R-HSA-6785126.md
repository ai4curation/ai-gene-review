display_name: FA core complex assembles at DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'In addition to FANCM, FAAP24, APITD1 (MHF1) and STRA13 (MHF2), the FA core
  complex also includes FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, FAAP20 and
  FAAP100 (Singh et al. 2010, Yan et al. 2010, Leung et al. 2012). While FANCA, FANCB,
  FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG and FANCL, and probably FAAP20 and FAAP100, can assemble
  a complex in the nucleoplasm, they are unable to load onto DNA in the absence of
  FANCM and FAAP24 (Kim et al. 2008, Yan et al. 2010, Leung et al. 2012). '
