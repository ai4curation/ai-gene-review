display_name: ERCC2 and ERCC3 DNA helicases form an open bubble structure in damaged
  DNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Two DNA helicases XPB (ERCC3) and XPD (ERCC2), which are part of the TFIIH
  complex, unwind the distorted DNA duplex around the lesion to form an open bubble
  structure that exposes the damaged site. The helicase activity of the TFIIH complex
  is stimulated by the presence of XPA and the XPC:RAD23:CETN2 complex (Winkler et
  al. 2001). The 5'->3' directed helicase activity of ERCC2 (Kuper et al. 2012) is
  crucial for unwinding of the distorted dsDNA during nucleotide excision repair (NER)
  (Coin et al. 2007). The 3'->5' directed DNA helicase ERCC3 contributes to dsDNA
  unwinding during NER through ATP hydrolysis (Coin et al. 2007). In addition to DNA
  unwinding, ERCC2 and ERCC3 verify the presence of DNA damage (Oksenych et al. 2009,
  Mathieu et al. 2010, Mathieu et al. 2013). Verification of DNA damage also involves
  XPA (Camenisch et al. 2006). The binding site of XPC determines which DNA strand
  is selected by ERCC2 to verify the presence of lesions (Sugasawa et al. 2009).
