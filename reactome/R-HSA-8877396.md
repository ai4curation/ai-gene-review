display_name: IL2RA (CD25) gene expression is stimulated by FOXP3 and inhibited by
  RUNX1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The RUNX1:CBFB complex inhibits transcription of the IL2RA (CD25) gene.
  Once FOXP3 binds to RUNX1, transcription of the IL2RA gene is stimulated. High IL2RA
  expression at the cell surface is one of the hallmarks of regulatory T cells (Tregs)
  (Ono et al. 2007). It is probable that FOXP3 acts as part of a complex with NFATC2
  (Wu et al. 2006). '

## Summary

The RUNX1:CBFB complex inhibits transcription of the IL2RA (CD25) gene. Once FOXP3 binds to RUNX1, transcription of the IL2RA gene is stimulated. High IL2RA expression at the cell surface is one of the hallmarks of regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Ono et al. 2007). It is probable that FOXP3 acts as part of a complex with NFATC2 (Wu et al. 2006).
