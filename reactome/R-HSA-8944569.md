stable_id: R-HSA-8944569
display_name: miR-25 microRNA binds PTEN mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA miR-25-3p, one of the two mature products of miR-25, binds the 3'UTR
  of PTEN mRNA (Poliseno et al. 2010). miR-25 causes reduction in both PTEN mRNA and
  protein levels and is thus shown to function as a part of the endonucleolytic RISC.
  It is possible that miR-25 also functions as a part of the nonendonucleolytic RISC.
