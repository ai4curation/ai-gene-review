stable_id: R-HSA-9729704
display_name: SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro dimer cleaves TAB1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 protease (3CLpro) specifically cleaves TAB1 at two sites
  and decreases its level in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Mutants with inhibited 3CLpro
  activity show no decrease in TAB1 levels (Moustaqil et al, 2021). Intact TAB1 is
  part of a complex that regulates the activity of TAK1, a regulator of the NFκB pathway
  and the signaling through the MAP kinases pathway in response to different stimuli
  and upon viral and bacterial infections (Dai et al, 2012; Malireddi et al, 2019).
