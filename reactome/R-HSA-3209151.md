stable_id: R-HSA-3209151
display_name: miR-24 binds p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNAs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA miR-24 is able to bind both p16INK4A mRNA (Lal et al. 2008) and
  p14ARF mRNA (To et al. 2012) through their shared 3'UTR. miR-24 inhibits translation
  of p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNAs, but does not induce mRNA degradation, resulting in
  expression of high levels of p16INK4A and p14ARF transcripts, while protein levels
  of p16INK4A and p14ARF are low (Lal et al. 2008, To et al. 2012).
