display_name: Phosphorylation of the Emi1 DSGxxS degron by Cyclin B:Cdc2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Emi1 is also believed to be phosphorylated by Cyclin B:Cdc2 on a CDK consensus
  site at Ser 182.  While Plk1 mediated phosphorylation  of Emi1 at the DSGxxS (ßTrCP
  recognition) motif is essential for Emi1 destruction in mitosis,  Cdk phosphorylation
  has been shown to play an important regulatory role.
