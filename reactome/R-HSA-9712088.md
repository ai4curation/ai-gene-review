display_name: ALK fusion proteins bind IRS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IRS1 binds the NPM-ALK fusion protein through tyrosine residue 167. Mutation
  of this residue abrogates IRS1 binding, but the NPM-ALK Y167 mutant is still able
  to support the transforming activity of the fusion protein (Fujimoto et al, 1996).

## Summary

IRS1 binds the NPM-ALK fusion protein through tyrosine residue 167. Mutation of this residue abrogates IRS1 binding, but the NPM-ALK Y167 mutant is still able to support the transforming activity of the fusion protein (Fujimoto et al, 1996).
