display_name: COMP binds Integrin alpha5beta1, Integrin alphaVbeta3, CD47
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP, thrombospondin-5) is a 524-kDa
  pentameric glycoprotein expressed primarily in cartilage, tendon, ligament and synovium.
  In adult cartilage, COMP has been shown to be located primarily in the inter-territorial
  matrix between chondrocytes (Murphy et al. 1999). The mature protein is pentameric
  with each monomer linked to its neighbour by a disulphide bond, located at the amino
  terminus of the protein (Hedbom et al. 1992, Morgelin et al. 1992). <br> <br>COMP
  binds integrin alpha5beta1 (Chen et al. 2005), integrin alphaVbeta3 (Neidhart et
  al.2005) and CD47 (also known as integrin-associated peptide or IAP, Rock et al.
  2010) on the cell surface of chondrocytes and fibroblasts.
