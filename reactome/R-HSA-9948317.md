display_name: ZNF598 and Ub:UBE2D1,2,3 bind stalled 80S ribosome
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Due to features such as damaged nucleotides, strong secondary structure,
  presence of stretches of more than four uninterrupted AAA codons in a mRNA coding
  region (designated no-go mRNAs) a ribosome translating an mRNA can stall and cause
  collisions with the ribosomes trailing it on the mRNA (reviewed in Joazeiro 2017,
  Filbeck et al. 2022). In cases in which the ribosome stalls internally on the mRNA
  and a 3' region of the mRNA protrudes from the ribosome, ZNF598, a ubiquitin E3
  ligase that is homologous to HEL2 in yeast, interacts with the ribosome. ZNF598
  copurifies with ribosomes (Garzia et al. 2017, Juszkiewicz and Hegde 2017, Sundaramoorthy
  et al. 2017) and predominantly binds stalled di-ribosomes rather than single ribosomes
  (Juszkiewicz et al. 2018). The yeast homolog of ZNF598, HEL2, shows similar activity
  (Matsuo et al. 2017, Sitron et al. 2017).

## Summary

Due to features such as damaged nucleotides, strong secondary structure, presence of stretches of more than four uninterrupted AAA codons in a mRNA coding region (designated no-go mRNAs) a ribosome translating an mRNA can stall and cause collisions with the ribosomes trailing it on the mRNA (reviewed in Joazeiro 2017, Filbeck et al. 2022). In cases in which the ribosome stalls internally on the mRNA and a 3' region of the mRNA protrudes from the ribosome, ZNF598, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that is homologous to HEL2 in yeast, interacts with the ribosome. ZNF598 copurifies with ribosomes (Garzia et al. 2017, Juszkiewicz and Hegde 2017, Sundaramoorthy et al. 2017) and predominantly binds stalled di-ribosomes rather than single ribosomes (Juszkiewicz et al. 2018). The yeast homolog of ZNF598, HEL2, shows similar activity (Matsuo et al. 2017, Sitron et al. 2017).
