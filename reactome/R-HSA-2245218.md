stable_id: R-HSA-2245218
display_name: CDK1 phosphorylates PHF8
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Increased activity of CDK1:CCNB1 during the cell cycle promotes PHF8 dissociation
  from chromatin, while the inhibition of CDK activity promotes binding of PHF8 to
  chromatin during mitosis. CDK1:CCNB1 complex phosphorylates PHF8 in vitro on serine
  residues S33 and S84. Mutation of PHF8 phosphorylation sites impairs the dissociation
  of PHF8 from chromatin and the accumulation of H4K20me1 in prophase (Liu et al.
  2010). Positions of CDK1-phosphorylated serine residues in PHF8, S33 and S84, are
  based on the sequence of PHF8 splicing isoform 2, which was used in the experiments
  of Liu et al. In PHF8 splicing isoforms 1 and 3, serine residues S69 and S120 are
  annotated as targets of CDK1-mediated phosphorylation.
