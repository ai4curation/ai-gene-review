species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'NPM-ALK, TFG-ALK and ATIC-ALK fusion proteins have been demonstrated to
  bind GRB2 by GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation (Fujimoto et al, 1996; Trinei
  et al, 2000; Hernandez et al, 2002). In the case of NPM-ALK, GRB binding is independent
  of the recruitment of SHC and IRS1, as the GRB2 interaction is not abrogated by
  the mutation of the primary SHC and IRS binding site at Y567 (Fujimoto et al, 1996).
  Neither direct binding of GRB2 nor a defined GRB2 binding site have been identified
  in the context of an ALK fusion protein, and recruitment may be mediated by other
  adaptor proteins, including PTPN11 (Voena et al, 2007). GRB2 binding appears to
  contribute to the transformation potential of the ALK fusion proteins, possibly
  by linking to the MAP kinase signaling pathway (Fujimoto et al, 1996; reviewed in
  Palmer, 2009). In some ALK fusions, the fusion partner may also be responsible for
  activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as is the case for EML4-ALK fusions
  (Hrustanovic et al 2015). '

## Summary

NPM-ALK, TFG-ALK and ATIC-ALK fusion proteins have been demonstrated to bind GRB2 by GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation (Fujimoto et al, 1996; Trinei et al, 2000; Hernandez et al, 2002).
