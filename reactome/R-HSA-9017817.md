species: Homo sapiens
summary: Binding of NOTCH3 to YBX1 (YB-1) triggers cleavage of NOTCH3 by the gamma-secretase
  complex. The exact steps of YBX1-mediated NOTCH3 activation are not known. The gamma-secretase
  complex releases NOTCH3 intracellular domain (NICD3), leading to activation of NOTCH3
  target genes downstream of YBX1 (Rauen et al. 2009).
