display_name: Association of p-S216-CDC25C with 14-3-3 proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CDC25C is phosphorylated by CHK1 at ser-216 (Blasina et al.,1999 ) resulting
  in both inhibition of the CDC25 phosphatase activity and creation of  a 14-3-3 docking
  site (Peng et al., 1997). Association of 14-3-3 proteins with phosphorylated CDC25C
  (p-S216-CDC25C) is thought to result in retention of this complex within the cytoplasm
  (Dalal et al., 1999; Graves et al, 2001).
