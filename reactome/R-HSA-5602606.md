stable_id: R-HSA-5602606
display_name: Defective MyD88 does not bind MAL(TIRAP):TLR2/4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The sorting MyD88 adaprtor-like (MAL or TIRAP) normally recruits MyD88 to
  activated TLR2 and TLR4 receptor complexes (Horng T et al. 2002; Verstak B et al.
  2009). MyD88 interacts with MAL (TIRAP) via their TIR domains and activates a downstream
  signaling pathway mediated by TLR2 and TLR4 (Ohnishi H et al. 2009). A GST pull-down
  assay showed that defective MyD88 R196C variant loses its ability to bind to MAL
  (Yamamoto T et al. 2014).
