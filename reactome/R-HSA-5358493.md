summary: 'Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2) catalyzes the GTP dependent ribosomal
  translocation step during translation elongation. This function requires the presence
  of a posttranslational modification, the conversion of histidine residue 715 to
  diphthamide (2'' [3 carboxamido 3 (trimethylammonio)propyl] L histidine) (Van Ness
  et al. 1978). No other protein is known to undergo this modification. The diphthamide
  residue is also the target of ADP ribosylation catalyzed by diphtheria toxin, which
  inactivates EEF2 and leads to cell death (Collier 1975; Pappenheim 1977).<p>Diphthamide
  synthesis proceeds in four steps: the transfer of 3 amino 3 carboxypropyl group
  from S adenosylmethionine to histidine 715 of EEF2, the addition of four methyl
  groups to the  3 amino 3 carboxypropyl moiety, the demethylation of the methylated
  carboxylate group to form diphthine, and the amidation of the diphthine carboxyl
  group (Liu et al. 2004; Lin et al. 2014; Schaffrath et al. 2014; Su et al. 2013;
