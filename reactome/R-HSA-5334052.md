display_name: TFC7L2 mutants don't bind CTBP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TCF7L2 is subject to frameshift and missense mutations in gastric and colorectal
  cancers that abolish the CTBP binding domain (Duval et al, 1999a; Duval et al, 1999b;
  Duval et al, 2000; Tang et al, 2008).  These mutant proteins fail to colocalize
  with CTBP and are unable to repress TCF-mediated transcription in vitro (Cuilliere-Dartigues
  et al, 2006).
