display_name: The distal appendage proteins recruit TTBK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: C2CD3 and the distal appendage protein CEP164 are required for the recruitment
  of the kinase Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) to the centriole (Ye et al, 2014; Cajanek
  et al, 2014). TTBK2 recruitment promotes the release of CCP110, a negative regulator
  of ciliogenesis that caps the mother centriole (Goetz et al, 2012; Ye et al, 2014;
  Tsang et al, 2008; Spektor et al, 2007). CCP110 is initially recruited and/or stabilized
  at the mother centriole in a KIF24-dependent manner; KIF24, a kinesin-like protein,
  also restricts ciliogenesis through its microtubule depolymerizing activity (Kobayashi
  et al, 2011). In addition to promoting the release of CCP110, TTBK2 also plays a
  role in the recruitment of intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins and in this way
  contributes to extension of the ciliary axoneme (Goetz et al, 2012; Ye et al, 2014).
  Mutations in TTBK2 disrupt ciliogenesis and are associated with the development
  of spinocerebellar ataxia (Houlden et al, 2007; Bouskila et al, 2011; reviewed in
  Jackson, 2012).
