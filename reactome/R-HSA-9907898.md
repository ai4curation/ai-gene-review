species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The inner ring of 20S core particle (20S CP) of 26S proteasome is formed
  by association of seven distinct beta-subunits (beta1–beta7, officially PSMB1-7
  in humans, where beta-1 corresponds to PSMB6, beta-2 to PSMB7, beta-3 to PSMB3,
  beta-4 to PSMB2, beta-5 to PSMB5, beta-6 to PSMB1, and beta-7 to PSMB4) (Hirano
  et al. 2006, reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). PSMB5 (beta-5), PSMB6 (beta-1),
  and PSMB7 (beta-2) subunits contain the proteolytic active sites (reviewed in Tomko
  and Hochstrasser 2013). Beta subunits assemble onto the inner surface of the pre-formed
  outer ring consisting of alpha subunits (PSMAs) (Hirano et al. 2006). POMP (UMP1)
  protein, which binds to the outer ring, plays an important role in initiation of
  the inner ring assembly (Hirano et al. 2006). By using precursor complex-specific
  antibodies to isolate 20S CP precursors from human cervical carcinoma cell line
  HeLa, it was shown that the main steps in the 20S core complex formation take place
  at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is directed by POMP (Fricke et al. 2007).
  POMP interacts with ER membranes, binds to the outer ring, recruits beta-subunits
  stepwise, and mediates the association of mammalian precursor complexes with the
  ER (Fricke et al. 2007). By systematic siRNA-mediated knockdown of beta subunits
  of the inner ring in human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T (Hirano et al. 2008)
  and by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of human 20S CP intermediates (Adolf
  et al. 2024), it was determined that the addition of beta subunits begins with beta-2
  (PSMB7), which loads either after POMP or together with POMP. Formation of the inner
  ring then proceeds in a defined order of beta-3 (PSMB3), beta-4 (PSMB2), beta-5
  (PSMB5), beta-6 (PSMB1), beta-1 (PSMB6), and finally beta-7 (PSMB4) (Hirano et al.
  2008; Adolf et al. 2024; reviewed in Tomko and Hockstrasser 2013). '

## Summary

The inner ring of 20S core particle (20S CP) of 26S proteasome is formed by association of seven distinct beta-subunits (beta1–beta7, officially PSMB1-7 in humans, where beta-1 corresponds to PSMB6, beta-2 to PSMB7, beta-3 to PSMB3, beta-4 to PSMB2, beta-5 to PSMB5, beta-6 to PSMB1, and beta-7 to PSMB4) (Hirano et al. 2006, reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). PSMB5 (beta-5), PSMB6 (beta-1), and PSMB7 (beta-2) subunits contain the proteolytic active sites (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). Beta subunits assemble onto the inner surface of the pre-formed outer ring consisting of alpha subunits (PSMAs) (Hirano et al. 2006). POMP (UMP1) protein, which binds to the outer ring, plays an important role in initiation of the inner ring assembly (Hirano et al. 2006).
