stable_id: R-MMU-5336365
display_name: Uhrf1:Chromatin binds Dnmt1
species: Mus musculus
summary: Uhrf1 (also known as Np95) associates with hemimethylated CG dinucleotides
  in DNA (Bostick et al. 2007, Sharif et al. 2007, Arita et al. 2008, Liu et al. 2013)
  and dimethylated or trimethylated lysine-9 in histone H3 (H3K9me2/3) (Bostick et
  al. 2007, Liu et al. 2013). Uhrf1 recruits Dnmt1 to methylate cytosine residues
  at replication foci (Leonhardt et al. 1992), producing symmetrically methylated
  DNA (Bostick et al. 2007, Sharif et al. 2007, Rottach et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2013).
