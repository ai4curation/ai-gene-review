display_name: Cytosolic PHD2,3 hydroxylates proline residues on HIF3A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Proline hydroxylases PHD2 (EGLN1) and PHD3 (EGLN3)  located in the cytosol
  (Metzen et al. 2003) hydroxylate HIF3A at proline-492 (Hirsila et al. 2003, Maynard
  et al. 2003). A portion of PHD3 (EGLN3) is also located in the nucleus (Rantanen
  et al. 2008).
