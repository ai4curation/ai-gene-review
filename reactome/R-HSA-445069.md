display_name: L1-EGFR trans-heterodimerization
species: Homo sapiens
summary: L1CAM and EGFR engage in a weak heterophilic trans interaction and this induces
  EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and its activation. However, this trans interaction
  alone is not sufficient to induce EGFR autophosphorylation, which requires additional
  cis type interactions between the two proteins.

## Summary

L1CAM and EGFR engage in a weak heterophilic trans interaction and this induces EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and its activation. However, this trans interaction alone is not sufficient to induce EGFR autophosphorylation, which requires additional cis type interactions between the two proteins.
