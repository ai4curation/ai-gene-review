summary: 'Binding of TNFα to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) induces the sequential formation
  of several signaling complexes, namely complex I and complex IIa/b (Walczak H 2011;
  Yuan J et al. 2019). These complexes support either cell survival (complex I) or
  cell death (complex II). The dynamic assembly of these complexes is tightly regulated
  by proteolysis, ubiquitination and phosphorylation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine
  protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and other components of the TNFα signaling pathway (reviewed
  in Yuan J et al. 2019; Varfolomeev E & Vucic D 2022). RIPK1 functions as a key regulator
  of both cell survival and cell death (reviewed in Ju E et al. 2022). Enzymatically
  inactive polyubiquitin-bound RIPK1 serves as a scaffold in the TNFR1 signaling complex
  (complex I) to recruit TAK1 kinase complex and I-kappa-B kinase (IKK) complex contributing
  to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-kappa-B signaling
  pathways, which regulate expression of pro-survival and inflammatory genes. Deubiquitination
  of RIPK1 leads to the activation of RIPK1 kinase activity, which promotes autophosphorylation
  of RIPK1 and RIPK1 kinase-dependent cell death (reviewed in Ju E et al. 2022). The
  kinase activity of RIPK1 is regulated by phosphorylation (Lafont E et al. 2018;

  RIPK1 within the membrane-bound TNFR1 signaling complex (complex I) (Dondelinger
  Y et al. 2015, 2019). IKK phosphorylates S25 in the kinase domain of RIPK1 to block
  ATP binding, preventing RIPK1 kinase activation and cell death (Dondelinger Y et

## Summary

Binding of TNFα to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) induces the sequential formation of several signaling complexes, namely complex I and complex IIa/b (Walczak H 2011; Yuan J et al. 2019). These complexes support either cell survival (complex I) or cell death (complex II).
