summary: 'At the beginning of this reaction, 1 molecule of ''phospho-IRS:activated
  insulin receptor'' is present. At the end of this reaction, 1 molecule of ''activated
  insulin receptor'', and 1 molecule of ''phospho-IRS'' are present.<br><br> This
  reaction takes place on the ''internal side of plasma membrane''.

  In Fao or NIH3T3 cells stably expressing IR, overexpression of PKCÎ¶ enhances the

# Dissociation of IRS-P from insulin receptor
**Reactome ID:** [R-HSA-74712](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-74712)
**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

At the beginning of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'phospho-IRS:activated insulin receptor' is present. At the end of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'activated insulin receptor', and 1 molecule of 'phospho-IRS' are present.<br><br> This reaction takes place on the 'internal side of plasma membrane'.
In Fao or NIH3T3 cells stably expressing IR, overexpression of PKCÎ¶ enhances the dissociation from IR and decrease in IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation caused by prolonged insulin stimulation (Riu et al. 2001, Ravichandran et al. 2001).
