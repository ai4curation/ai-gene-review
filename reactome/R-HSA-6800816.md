display_name: TP53 or TP63 stimulates PERP gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Binding of TP53 (p53) or TP63 (p63) to p53 response elements in the promoter
  and/or the first intron of the PERP gene promotes PERP transcription (Attardi et
  al. 2000, Ihrie et al. 2005). E2F1 may cooperate with TP53 in the transcriptional
  activation of PERP (Attardi et al. 2000). PERP is a transmembrane protein that specifically
  localizes to desmosomes and is important for epithelial integrity. PERP is involved
  in p53-dependent apoptosis (Attardi et al. 2000, Ihrie et al. 2003) and may act
  through contributing to caspase activation (Davies et al. 2009). '
