species: Mus musculus
summary: Phospholipase C gamma (Plcg1 or Plcg2) bound to the phosphorylated cytoplasmic
  domain of the EPO receptor (Epor) hydrolyzes 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  to yield the second messengers diacylglycerol and 1D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (Beckman et al. 1996, and inferred from human homologs). Erythropoietin also activates
  the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (Beckman et al.
  1996),
