display_name: TP53 in complex with EP300, PRMT1 and CARM1 stimulates GADD45A transcription
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Binding of TP53 (p53) to the p53 response element in the third intron of
  the GADD45A gene, together with chromatin modification mediated by TP53-associated
  proteins CARM1, PRMT1 and EP300, stimulates GADD45A transcription (An et al. 2004).

## Summary

Binding of TP53 (p53) to the p53 response element in the third intron of the GADD45A gene, together with chromatin modification mediated by TP53-associated proteins CARM1, PRMT1 and EP300, stimulates GADD45A transcription (An et al. 2004).
