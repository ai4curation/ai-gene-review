stable_id: R-HSA-5690827
display_name: TNFAIP3 (A20) ubiquitinates RIPK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The carboxy-terminal domain of TNFAIP3 (A20) functions as a ubiquitin ligase,
  polyubiquitinating RIPK1 with K48-linked ubiquitin chains, thereby targeting it
  for proteasomal degradation (Wertz et al. 2004).
