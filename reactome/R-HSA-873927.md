display_name: Release of STAT1 dimer from active receptor unit
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The phosphorylated STAT1 on IFNGR1 chains homodimerize through reciprocal
  SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions to form p-STAT1 homodimer called gamma-activated-factor
  (GAF). This phosphorylated STAT1 homodimer disassociates from the receptor complex
  and translocates to the nucleus.
