summary: At the beginning of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'H2O', and 1 molecule of
  'trans-Hexadec-2-enoyl-CoA' are present. At the end of this reaction, 1 molecule
  of '(S)-3-Hydroxyhexadecanoyl-CoA' is present.<br><br> This reaction takes place
  in the 'mitochondrial matrix' and  is mediated by the 'enoyl-CoA hydratase activity'
  of 'Trifunctional Protein'.<br>
