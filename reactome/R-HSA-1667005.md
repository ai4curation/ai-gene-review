display_name: Heparanase (HPSE) cleaves heparan sulfate from its proteoglycan (lysosome)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Heparanase (HPSE) is an endoglycosidase that cleaves heparan sulfate (HS)
  chains from its HS proteoglycan (HSPG), by selectively cleaving the linkage between
  a glucuronic acid (GlcA) unit and an N-sulfo glucosamine unit (GlcNACS, Toyoshima
  & Nakajima 1999; Okada et al. 2002). We show the cleavage of the -GlcNAcS-GlcA-
  bond nearest to the protein, leaving the tetrasaccharide GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl linker
  attached to the core protein. The formation of a heterodimer of 8kDa and 50kDa subunits
  cleaved from the 65kDa form is required for enzyme activity (Levy-Adam et al. 2003)
  and this proteolytic cleavage occurs in the lysosome (Goldshmidt et al. 2002). Acidic
  conditions within the lysosome optimises HPSE activity.
