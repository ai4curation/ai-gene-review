display_name: LINC01139 promotes phosphorylation of HIF1A by PTK6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PTK6 (BRK) tyrosine kinase, activated via long non-coding RNA LINC01139 (LINK-A)
  mediated recruitment to phosphorylated GPNMB (bound to HBEGF-activated EGFR), phosphorylates
  hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A) at tyrosine residue Y565. Phosphorylation
  of HIF1A by PTK6 at Y565 inhibits HIF1A hydroxylation at proline P564, resulting
  in HIF1A stabilization under normoxic conditions (Lin et al. 2016).
