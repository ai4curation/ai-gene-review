species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'SLP-76 is an adaptor protein that links proximal and distal T cell receptor
  signaling events through its function as a molecular scaffold in the assembly of
  multi molecular signaling complexes. SLP-76 consists of three domains that mediate
  interactions with many different signaling proteins: an N-terminal acidic domain
  containing three tyrosine phosphorylation sites, a large central proline-rich region,
  and a C-terminal SH2 domain. The function of SLP-76 is dependent on its association
  with Gads. SLP-76 constitutively binds through its ''RxxK'' motif in the proline
  rich region to the SH3 domain of Gads upon TCR activation. '
