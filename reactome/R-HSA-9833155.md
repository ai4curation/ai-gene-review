display_name: Ubiquitination of STAT2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Human signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) is subject
  to ubiquitination by, among other E3 ubiquitin ligases, a complex consisting of
  human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) protein NS1 with elongin C (ELOC) and cullin-5
  (CUL5). This leads to loss of STAT2 protein in RSV-infected cells, which downregulates
  the host type I interferon response (Elliott et al, 2007).
