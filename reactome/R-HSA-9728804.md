stable_id: R-HSA-9728804
display_name: SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 binds to PPIase
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIase) function as protein folding chaperones.
  All five PPIases PPIA, PPIB, PPIG, PPIH, and FKBP1A have been shown to bind to SARS-CoV-1
  nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), significantly activating the Cyclophilin A/NFAT
  pathway, ultimately enhancing the induction of the IL-2 promoter. The increase of
  NFAT activation extends to all three major NFAT species, suggesting a potential
  for induction of broad and systemic cytokine dysregulation by affecting several
  types of immune cells (Pfefferle et al, 2011; Law et al, 2007).
