display_name: Misspliced GSK3beta mutants stabilize beta-catenin levels
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GSK3beta mRNA is subject to aberrant splicing in stem cells in chronic myeloid
  leukemia.  Missplicing leads to in-frame deletion of exons 8 and 9 which encode
  the FRAT and AXIN binding domains of the protein (Jamieson et al, 2008; Abrahamsson
  et al, 2009).  Cells expressing the mutant GSK3beta have elevated levels of nuclear
  beta-catenin and high levels of TCF-dependent reporter activity (Jamieson et al,
  2008; Abrahamsson et al, 2009).  Although it is possible that the defect in the
  ability of mutant GSK3beta to promote beta-catenin degradation arises from an inability
  to bind to AXIN and form a functional degradation complex, this has not been formally
  demonstrated.
