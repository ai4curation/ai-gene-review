display_name: miR-9 binds CDH1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After miR-9 was computationally predicted to form a duplex with CDH1 (E-cadherin)
  mRNA 3'UTR (Ma et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2013; Drakaki et al. 2015; Nishioka et al.
  2017), miR-9 was shown to reduce the activity of a luciferase reporter fused to
  the wild-type 3′ UTR of the CDH1 mRNA but not to a mutant 3′UTR carrying altered
  nucleotides in the miR-9 ‘seed-pairing’ recognition site.This implies that downregulation
  of CDH1 by miR-9 depends directly on a single cognate recognition site in the CDH1
  mRNA 3′UTR (Ma et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2013; Drakaki et al. 2015). miR-9 expression
  and CDH1 downregulation are positively regulated by MYC and MYCN which stimulate
  transcription of miR-9 from the MIR9-3 gene locus (Ma et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2013,
  Qin et al. 2022).
