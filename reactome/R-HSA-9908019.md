display_name: Formation of the 19S regulatory particle lid
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PSMD8 (ortholog of yeast Rpn12) binds the lid particle 2 (LP2) to form the
  lid of the proteasome 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser
  2013). A study in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T confirmed that PSMD2
  (Rpn12) is the last component of the 19S RP lid to be incorporated and may serve
  as a checkpoint that monitors the integrity of the LP2 complex (Bai et al. 2019).
