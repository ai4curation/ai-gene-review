summary: 'Upon interaction with CARMA1, Bcl10 undergoes phosphorylation and oligomerization.
  The oligomerized Bcl10 acts as a adaptor for the incoming MALT1 and TRAF6. Phosphorylation
  events of Bcl10 can both positively and negatively regulate the NF-kB pathway. Phosphorylation
  of Bcl10 that depends on the Ser/Thr kinase RIP2 and correlated with the physical
  association of Bcl10 with RIP2 has a activation effect on the NF-kB pathway. The

## Summary

Upon interaction with CARMA1, Bcl10 undergoes phosphorylation and oligomerization. The oligomerized Bcl10 acts as a adaptor for the incoming MALT1 and TRAF6. Phosphorylation events of Bcl10 can both positively and negatively regulate the NF-kB pathway. Phosphorylation of Bcl10 that depends on the Ser/Thr kinase RIP2 and correlated with the physical association of Bcl10 with RIP2 has a activation effect on the NF-kB pathway. The target sites of RIP2-mediated phosphorylation has not yet been identified.
