display_name: AURKB phosphorylates DIAPH2-2 at kinetochores
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Aurora kinase B (AURKB), which is part of the kinetochore, phosphorylates
  DIAPH2-2 (DIA-12C, mDia3) on serine residue S196 in the FH3 (DID) domain and probably
  on several other residues in the FH3 and FH2 domains. AURKB-mediated phosphorylation
  of DIAPH2-2 is necessary for the regulation of microtubule binding to kinetochores
  by the CDC42:GTP:DIAPH2-2 complex (Cheng et al. 2011).
