display_name: CCNA:CDK1/2 complexes and CCNB1:CDK1 complexes phosphorylate FOXM1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the G2 phase of the cell cycle, cyclin A (CCNA) and B (CCNB)-dependent
  kinases CDK1 and CDK2 phosphorylate FOXM1 transcription factor, increasing its transcriptional
  activity. Threonine residue T611 (corresponds to T596 in FOXM1B isoform) was shown
  to be phosphorylated by both CCNA:CDK1/2 and CCNB:CDK1 complexes and its functional
  relevance is best establshed (Major et al. 2004, Laoukili et al. 2008, Fu et al.
  2008). CCNA:CDK1/2 may also phosphorylate FOXM1 on T600 (Laoukili et al. 2008),
  while CCNB:CDK1 may phosphorylate it on S693 (S678 in FOXM1B isoform) (Fu et al.
  2008). The phosphorylation of FOXM1 threonine residue T611 relieves the N-terminal
  domain-mediated autoinhibition of FOXM1 transcriptional activity (Laoukili et al.
  2008), likely enabling interaction with transcriptional co-activators (Major et
  al. 2004), and creates a docking site for the Polo-box domain (PBD) of PLK1 (Fu
  et al. 2008).
