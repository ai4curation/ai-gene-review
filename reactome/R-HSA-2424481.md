display_name: Recruitment of VAV and BTK to p-SLP-76
species: Homo sapiens
summary: VAV2 and VAV3 are expressed in human NK cells and play a central role in
  NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. They are required for DAP12-mediated signaling; their
  loss profoundly impairs DAP12-induced cytotoxicity (Billadeau et al. 2000, Cella
  et al. 2004). Phosphorylated SLP-76 tyrosines Y113 and Y128 provide binding sites
  for the SH2 domains of VAV. The binding of VAV to these phosphotyrosine residues
  may link SLP-76 to the Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and the actin cytoskeleton.
  Y145 has been implicated in the binding of SLP-76 to the Tec family kinase BTK (Kettner
  et al. 2003). BTK is required for secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 and PLCgamma and Ca2+ mobilization (Ormsby et al. 2011).
