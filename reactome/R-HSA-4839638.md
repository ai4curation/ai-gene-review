display_name: CTNNB1 T41 mutants aren't phosphorylated by GSK3beta
species: Homo sapiens
summary: T41 mutations of beta-catenin interfere with GSK3 phosphorylation and result
  in stabilization and nuclear accumulation of the protein (Moreno-Bueno et al, 2002;
  Taniguchi et al, 2002; reviewed in Polakis, 2012).  T41 mutations have been identified
  in cancers of the liver and brain, as well as in the pituitary, endometrium, large
  intestine and skin, among others (reviewed in Polakis, 2000; Saito-Diaz et al, 2013).
