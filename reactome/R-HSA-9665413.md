species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAS signaling is activated dowsntream of ERBB2 ECD mutants ERBB2 G309A (Bose
  et al. 2013), ERBB2 G309E (Greulich et al. 2012) and ERBB2 S310F (Greulich et al.
  2012), as evidenced by activating phosphorylation of ERKs (MAPK1 and MAPK3). It
  is assumed that phosphorylated heterodimers of ERBB2 ECD mutants and EGFR, like
  phosphorylated heterodimers of the wild type ERBB2, can recruit the GRB2:SOS1 complex
  through phosphorylated SHC1.
