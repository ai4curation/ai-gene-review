display_name: EGR2, SOX10 and TEAD1 bind enhancers in the PMP22 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PMP22 gene expression is regulated during peripheral nerve myelination by
  the binding of EGR2 and SOX10 to upstream and intronic enhancer elements (Nagarajan
  et al, 2001; Maier et al, 2002; Maier et al, 2003; Jones et al, 2011; Srinivasan
  et al, 2012). Hippo signaling also influences PMP22 expression during peripheral
  never myelination by modulating the binding of the TEAD1, WWTR1 (also known as TAZ)
  and YAP1 to cognate sites in the PMP22 gene (Lopez-Anido et al, 2016; reviewed in
  Castelnovo et al, 2017).
