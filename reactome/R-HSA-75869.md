display_name: 'Addition of the fourth nucleotide on the Nascent Transcript: Second
  Transition'
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Formation of the third  phosphodiester bond creates a 4-nt product. This
  commits the initiation complex to promoter escape. The short 4-nt transcript is
  still loosely associated with the RNA polymerase II initiation complex and can dissociate
  to yield abortive products, which are not further extended. Inhibition of ATP-hydrolysis
  by TFIIH  does not lead to collapse of the open region any longer. The transcription
  complex has lost the sensitivity to single-stranded oligo-nucleotide inhibition.
  However, ATP-hydrolysis and TFIIH are required for efficient promoter escape.  The
  open region ("transcription bubble") expands concomitant with the site of RNA-extension.
  In this case this region spans positions -9 to +4.
