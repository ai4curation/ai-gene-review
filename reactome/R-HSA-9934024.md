display_name: SMARCA4, BCL11A,B-containing ATPase module binds SMARCC1:SMACC2 dimer:SMARCD1:SMARCE1:SMARCB1:ARID1A:DPF2,
  PHF10
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ATPase module of the esBAF complex contains SMARCA4/BRG1 to the exclusion
  of SMARCA2/BRM (Zhang et al, 2014; Ho et al, 2009; reviewed in Kadoch and Crabtree,
  2015; Innis and Cabot, 2020 Cenik and Shilatifard, 2021). Like the cBAF and ncBAF,
  esBAF also contains the SS18 subunit, and is additionally characterized by the inclusion
  of either BCL11A or BCL11B. Whether BCL11A and B are unique to esBAF or are also
  components of cBAF is not clear (Kadoch et al, 2013; Mashtalir et al, 2018; Mashtalir
  et al, 2020; reviewed in Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015; Innis and Cabot, 2020; Cenik
  and Shilatifard, 2021).
