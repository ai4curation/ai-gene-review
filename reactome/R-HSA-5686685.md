summary: 'RIF1 binds TP53BP1 phosphorylated by ATM at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs).
  RIF1 binding interferes with the accumulation of BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimers and associated
  proteins at DNA DSBs. Therefore, TP53BP1-mediated recruitment of RIF1 prevents RBBP8
  (CtIP) binding to BRCA1:BARD1 and the subsequent resection of DNA DSBs. The action
  of RIF1 and TP53BP1 promotes non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) of DNA DSBs during
  G1 phase of the cell cycle, when sister chromatids are not available for homologous
  recombination-mediated repair (Zimmermann et al. 2013, Escribano-Diaz et al. 2013).<p>Similar
  to RIF1, PAX1IP (PTIP) is also recruited to DNA DSBs through interaction with ATM-phosphorylated
  TP53BP1. Since RIF1 and PAX1IP interact with different phosphorylated sites on TP53BP1,
  they can simultaneously bind TP53BP1 and colocalize in the majority of TP53BP1 foci.
  PAX1IP contributes to inhibition of DNA DSB resection mediated by BRCA1-recruited
  RBBP8 (CtIP) (Callen et al. 2013). '

## Summary

RIF1 binds TP53BP1 phosphorylated by ATM at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). RIF1 binding interferes with the accumulation of BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimers and associated proteins at DNA DSBs. Therefore, TP53BP1-mediated recruitment of RIF1 prevents RBBP8 (CtIP) binding to BRCA1:BARD1 and the subsequent resection of DNA DSBs. The action of RIF1 and TP53BP1 promotes non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) of DNA DSBs during G1 phase of the cell cycle, when sister chromatids are not available for homologous recombination-mediated repair (Zimmermann et al. 2013, Escribano-Diaz et al. 2013).<p>Similar to RIF1, PAX1IP (PTIP) is also recruited to DNA DSBs through interaction with ATM-phosphorylated TP53BP1.
