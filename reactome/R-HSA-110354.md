display_name: Displacement of OGG1 glycosylase by APEX1 at the AP site
species: Homo sapiens
summary: APEX1 (APE1, HAP1), a DNA apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site lyase, displaces
  OGG1 from the AP site generated by the OGG1 DNA glycosylase activity, thus allowing
  for the base excision repair to proceed (Hill et al. 2001, Kuznetsova et al. 2014).

## Summary

APEX1 (APE1, HAP1), a DNA apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site lyase, displaces OGG1 from the AP site generated by the OGG1 DNA glycosylase activity, thus allowing for the base excision repair to proceed (Hill et al. 2001, Kuznetsova et al. 2014).
