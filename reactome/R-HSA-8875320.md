display_name: RAB5 GEFs exchange GTP for GDP on RAB5
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAB5 has roles at early endosomal compartments including fusion of vesicles
  originating from the plasma membrane with early endosomes, and is implicated in
  clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Chavrier et al, 1990; Bucci et al, 1992; Gorvel et
  al, 1991; Hoffenberg et al, 2000; Zeigerer et al, 2012; Taylor et al, 2011).  RAB5
  activation is mediated by a number of GEFs including members of the RIN (RAS and
  RAB interactor) and ALS2 families and GAPVD1, all of which belong to the VPS9-domain
  containing group (Horiuchi et al, 1997; Tall et al, 2001; Saito et al, 2002; Kajiho
  et al, 2003; Kajiho et al, 2011; Kunita et al, 2004; Hadano et al, 2004; Hunker
  et al, 2006; Suzuki-Utsunomiya et al, 2007; reviewed in Ishida et al, 2016). Interaction
  of RAB5 with its GEFs promotes release of GDP, allowing GTP to bind, and precludes
  the interaction of RAB5 with GDI and CHM proteins.
