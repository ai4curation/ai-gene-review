display_name: Gads binds CD28
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ' GADS (Grb2-related adaptor protein 2) plays a crucial role in CD28-mediated
  NF-kB activation, which is vital for effective T cell activation and immune responses.
  This signal is mediated by the direct binding of GADS to the YMNM motif in the cytoplasmic
  tail of CD28. Additionally, the proline-rich PxxP motif in CD28 is also required
  for the optimal association of Gads with the CD28 signaling complex. These interactions
  help bridge CD28 with other intracellular signaling pathways, ensuring robust NF-kB
  activation and subsequent T cell proliferation and cytokine production (Watanabe
  et al. 2006).'
