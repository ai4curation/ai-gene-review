display_name: Translesion synthesis across unhooked ICL by POLN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The error-prone DNA polymerase nu (POLN) performs translesion DNA synthesis
  using the DNA strand with unhooked interstrand crosslink (ICL) as a template, thereby
  bypassing the unhooked ICL (Moldovan et al. 2010, Yamanaka et al. 2010). The DNA
  strand with unhooked ICL is subsequently repaired via nucleotide excision repair
  (NER), while the double strand break (DSB) generated by incision of the stalled
  replication fork during the unhooking step is repaired via homologous recombination
  repair (HRR) (reviewed by Kottemann and Smogorzewska 2013, Deans and West 2011).
