display_name: KRAS4B recycles to the plasma membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ARL2:GTP facilitates the release of the farnesyl group on KRAS4B by promoting
  a conformational change in PDE6D (Ismail et al, 2011; Schmick et al, 2014). This
  step is required for the proper localization of KRAS4B at the plasma membrane, but
  the complete details of this are not fully established. Newly liberated KRAS4B by
  interact with the negatively charged membrane of recycling endosome and in this
  way be targeted back to the plasma membrane (Chen et al, 2010; Schmick et al, 2014;
  reviewed in Schmick et al, 2015
