summary: The cytosolic phosphorylase kinase complex catalyzes the phosphorylation

  kinase complex have been described (Brushia and Walsh 1999). The one annotated here,

  PHKB (beta regulatory) (Burwinkel et al. 2003), PHKG1 (gamma catalytic) (Burwinkel
  et al. 2003) and CALM (calmodulin) subunits is abundant in muscle and its action
  on the form of phosphorylase (PYGM) abundant in muscle is described.<p>While initial
  studies of PGYM from rabbit muscle suggested that it is a homotetramer (Keller and
  Cori 1953), more recent work indicates that under physiological conditions the enzyme
  occurs as a homodimer (Huang and Graves 1970) and a dimeric structure for the human
  enzyme is inferred here.
