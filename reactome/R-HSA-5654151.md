stable_id: R-HSA-5654151
display_name: Activated FGFR4 phosphorylates PLCG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PLC gamma is phosphorylated by activated FGFR, resulting in PLC gamma activation,
  stimulation of phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis and generation of two second messengers,
  diacylglycerol and inositol (1,4,5) P3.  Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma by
  FGFR4 is weaker than that seen by other isoforms of FGFR.
