display_name: IRAK2 is phosphorylated downstream of IRAK4 following IL1 receptor activation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IRAK2 has been implicated in IL1R and TLR signaling by the observation that
  IRAK2 can associate with MyD88 and Mal (Muzio et al. 1997). Like IRAK1, IRAK2 is
  activated downstream of IRAK4 (Kawagoe et al. 2008). It has been suggested that
  IRAK1 activates IRAK2 (Wesche et al. 1999) but  IRAK2 phosphorylation is observed
  in IRAK1–/– mouse macrophages while IRAK4 deficiency abrogates IRAK2 phosphorylation
  (Kawagoe et al. 2008), suggesting that activated IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK2 as it
  does IRAK1. IL6 production in response to IL1beta is impaired in embryonic fibroblasts
  from IRAK1 or IRAK2 knockout mice and abrogated in IRAK1/2 dual knockouts (Kawagoe
  et al. 2007) suggesting that IRAK1 and IRAK2 are both involved in IL1R signaling
  downstream of IRAK4.
