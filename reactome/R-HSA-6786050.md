display_name: IL4R, IL13RA, JAK2 and TYK2 are tyrosine phosphorylated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-4 receptor alpha subunit (IL4R) and Interleukin-13 receptor subunit
  alpha 1 (IL13RA1) are phosphorylated on tyrosines in response to Interleukin-13
  (IL13) in human blood monocytes (Roy et al. 2002, Bhattacharjee et al. 2013). The
  associated Janus-kinase (JAK) family kinases JAK2 and TYK2 are also phosphorylated
  (Roy & Cathcart  1998, Bhattacharjee et al. 2013). Although JAK1 binds to IL4R in
  response to IL13, it does not appear to be phosphorylated in response to IL13 (Roy
  & Cathcart 1998, Bhattacharjee et al. 2013).
