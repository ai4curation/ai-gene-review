stable_id: R-HSA-162730
display_name: phosphatidylinositol + UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine -> N-acetylglucosaminyl-PI
  + UDP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The first step of GPI synthesis is the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from
  cytosolic UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidyl inositol (PI) in the endoplasmic
  reticulum membrane. The reaction is catalyzed by a multimeric enzyme, also localized
  to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, seven components of which have been identified
  to date by mutagenesis studies in cultured cells and by co-precipitation and reconstitution
  studies in vitro (Murakami et al. 2005; Watanabe et al. 1996, 1998, 2000).
