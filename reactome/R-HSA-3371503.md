species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1, also known as HSP70-HSP90-organizing
  protein or HOP) functions as a mediator of interaction between heat shock protein
  (HSP)70 and HSP90 as part of the cellular assembly machine. It also modulates the
  ATPase activity of both HSP70 and HSP90, thus facilitating client protein transfer
  between the two. STIP1 is a monomeric protein composed of three tetratricopeptide
  repeat domains (TPR1, TPR2A, TPR2B) involved in protein-protein interactions, and
  two small aspartic acid–proline repeat domains (DP1, DP2) involved in client activation
  (Scheufler C et al. 2000; Nelson GM et al. 2003; Yi F et al. 2010; Schmid AB et
  al. 2012). A flexible linker of STIP1 (HOP) connects TPR1-DP1 and TPR2A-TPR2B-DP2
  modules arranging it as TPR1-DP1-TPR2A-TPR2B-DP2 (Scheufler C et al. 2000). Biochemical
  and crystallographic analysis revealed that TPR domains of STIP1 interact specifically
  with C-terminal MEEVD motifs of HSP70 or HSP90 chaperones; TPR2A binds preferentially
  to HSP90, whereas TPR1 and TPR2B bind to HSP70 (Scheufler C et al. 2000; Carrigan
  PE et al. 2006; Schmid AB et al. 2012). Furthermore, cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM)
  reconstruction of the human HSP90:STIP1 complex revealed that STIP1 may also form
  interactions in several other parts of HSP90, pre-organizing N-terminal domains
  (NTDs) of HSP90 and thus increasing accessibility of the nucleotide-binding pocket
  (Southworth DR & Agard DA 2011). STIP1 stabilizes an alternate HSP90 open state
  where hydrophobic client-binding surfaces of HSP90 monomers have converged remaining
  accessible for client loading (Southworth DR & Agard DA 2011). STIP1 is positioned
  with a TPR1 domain extending from the HSP90 dimer cleft remaining available for
  an interaction with HSP70. In the STIP1-stabilized HSP90 conformation the N-terminal
  domains have rotated to match the closed ATP conformation. However, the arrangement
  of the STIP1 domains in the complex seems to prevent the NTDs dimerization of HSP90
  monomers and total closure of the HSP90 dimer that is required for an efficient
  HSP90-mediated ATP hydrolysis (Southworth DR & Agard DA 2011; Alvira S et al. 2014).
  HSP70, in the ADP state, readily binds HSP90:STIP1, forming a client-loading complex
  HSP90:STIP1:HSP70:client protein (Hernández MP et al. 2002). Structural studies
  of GR-LBD (the ligand-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor) bound to HSP90:STIP1:HSP70
  complex showed that one STIP1 molecule binds to the HSP90 dimer and through domain
  rearrangement, gives rise to two main conformations, an extended structure that
  recognizes and interacts with HSP70, and a compact one in which HSP70 is in contact
  with one HSP90 monomer (Alvira S et al. 2014). Movement between these two modes
  is thought to deliver the HSP70-bound substrate to the side of the HSP90 dimer opposite
  the site of STIP1 binding (Alvira S et al. 2014). Following client delivery by HSP70
  and STIP1 release, HSP90:ATP converts to the closed ATP hydrolysis-active state
  to complete the chaperone cycling. '

## Summary

Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1, also known as HSP70-HSP90-organizing protein or HOP) functions as a mediator of interaction between heat shock protein (HSP)70 and HSP90 as part of the cellular assembly machine. It also modulates the ATPase activity of both HSP70 and HSP90, thus facilitating client protein transfer between the two. STIP1 is a monomeric protein composed of three tetratricopeptide repeat domains (TPR1, TPR2A, TPR2B) involved in protein-protein interactions, and two small aspartic acid–proline repeat domains (DP1, DP2) involved in client activation (Scheufler C et al. 2000; Nelson GM et al. 2003; Yi F et al. 2010; Schmid AB et al. 2012). A flexible linker of STIP1 (HOP) connects TPR1-DP1 and TPR2A-TPR2B-DP2 modules arranging it as TPR1-DP1-TPR2A-TPR2B-DP2 (Scheufler C et al. 2000). Biochemical and crystallographic analysis revealed that TPR domains of STIP1 interact specifically with C-terminal MEEVD motifs of HSP70 or HSP90 chaperones; TPR2A binds preferentially to HSP90, whereas TPR1 and TPR2B bind to HSP70 (Scheufler C et al. 2000; Carrigan PE et al. 2006; Schmid AB et al. 2012).
