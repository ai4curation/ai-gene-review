summary: 'During the phosphorylation of the IKK beta, the regulatory subunit NEMO
  undergoes K-63-linked polyubiquitination. Ubiquitinated TRAF6 trimer, acts as a
  E3 ligase and induces this ubiquitination. The ubiquitin target sites in NEMO are
  not yet clearly identified. Studies of different NF-kB signaling pathways revealed
  several potential ubiquitination sites on NEMO (e.g., K285, K277, K309 and K399)

# Ubiquitination of NEMO by TRAF6

**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

During the phosphorylation of the IKK beta, the regulatory subunit NEMO undergoes K-63-linked polyubiquitination. Ubiquitinated TRAF6 trimer, acts as a E3 ligase and induces this ubiquitination. The ubiquitin target sites in NEMO are not yet clearly identified. Studies of different NF-kB signaling pathways revealed several potential ubiquitination sites on NEMO (e.g., K285, K277, K309 and K399) (Fuminori et al. 2009).
