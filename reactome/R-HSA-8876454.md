display_name: DENND3 exchanges GTP for GDP on RAB12
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'DENND3 is a RAB12-specific GEF with roles in macroautophagy and the trafficking
  of proteins from the recycling endosome to the lysosome (Yoshimura et al, 2010;
  Matsui et al, 2014; Xu et al, 2015; reviewed in Xu and McPherson, 2015). DENND3
  activity promotes the formation of active RAB12:GTP, required for the constitutive
  degradation of plasma membrane proteins such as the transferrin receptor and the
  amino acid transporter SLC36A4, also known as PAT4 (Matsui et al, 2011; Matsui and
  Fukuda, 2013; Matsui et al, 2014; Sirohi et al, 2013). Under starvation conditions,
  DENND3 is phosphorylated by the macroautophagy-promoting kinase ULK1. DENND3- and  RAB12-dependent
  degradation of SLC36A4 contributes to the activation of the macroautophagy pathway
  by decreasing intracellular amino-acid levels and inhibiting mTORC1 (Matsui and
  Fukuda, 2013; Matsui et al, 2014; Xu et al, 2015; Fan et al, 2016; reviewed in Xu
  and McPherson, 2015). '
