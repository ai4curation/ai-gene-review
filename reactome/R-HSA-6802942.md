summary: Dimerization of kinase-dead or inhibited versions of BRAF to RAF1/CRAF leads
  to the recruitment and phosphorylation of MAP2Ks and MAPKs (Wan et al, 2004; Garnett
  et al, 2005; Heidorn et al, 2010;  Poulikakos et al, 2010; Hatzivassiliou et al,
  2010; reviewed in Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014; Lavoie and Therrien, 2015). Although
  the interactions haven't been studied in detail, these disease pathways are presumed
  to recruit MAP2Ks and MAPKs in a scaffold-dependent manner similar to WT (reviewed
  in Matallanas et al, 2011).

## Summary

Dimerization of kinase-dead or inhibited versions of BRAF to RAF1/CRAF leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of MAP2Ks and MAPKs (Wan et al, 2004; Garnett et al, 2005; Heidorn et al, 2010;  Poulikakos et al, 2010; Hatzivassiliou et al, 2010; reviewed in Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014; Lavoie and Therrien, 2015). Although the interactions haven't been studied in detail, these disease pathways are presumed to recruit MAP2Ks and MAPKs in a scaffold-dependent manner similar to WT (reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011).
