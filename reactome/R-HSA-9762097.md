display_name: MYC binds the NFE2L2 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MYC binds to its cognate binding site in the promoter of the NFE2L2 gene
  to drive its expression in head and neck cancers (Tang et al, 2021). NFE2L2 upregulation
  downstream of MYC stimulates transcription of NFE2L2 target genes in the pentose
  phosphate pathway such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and transaldolase
  (TALDO1) and contributes to metabolic reprogramming and oncogenic progression (Tang
  et al, 2021; reviewed in He et al, 2020; Kitamura et al, 2020).

## Summary

MYC binds to its cognate binding site in the promoter of the NFE2L2 gene to drive its expression in head and neck cancers (Tang et al, 2021). NFE2L2 upregulation downstream of MYC stimulates transcription of NFE2L2 target genes in the pentose phosphate pathway such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and transaldolase (TALDO1) and contributes to metabolic reprogramming and oncogenic progression (Tang et al, 2021; reviewed in He et al, 2020; Kitamura et al, 2020).
