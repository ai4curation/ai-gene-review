stable_id: R-HSA-195275
display_name: Phosphorylation of APC component of the destruction complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: APC is phosphorylated on the 20 aa repeats by CK1 and potentially GSK-3.
  This significantly increases the binding affinity of the APC 20 aa repeats for beta-catenin,
  causing one of them to bind b-catenin in the same region as beta-catenin binds Axin,
  thus displacing beta-catenin from Axin ( Step 5 above) (Reviewed in Kimelman, 2006).
