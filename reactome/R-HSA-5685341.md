stable_id: R-HSA-5685341
display_name: BCDX2 complex stabilizes RAD51 filament
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The BCDX2 complex, composed of RAD51 paralogs RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D and
  XRCC2, preferentially binds at the ends of 3' overhanging ssDNA created by resection
  of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The BCDX2 complex stabilizes nucleoprotein filaments
  formed by BRCA2-mediated RAD51 loading onto ssDNA (Masson et al. 2001, Chun et al.
  2013). The BCDX2 complex may act by inhibiting displacement of RAD51 by BLM helicase
  (Amunugama et al. 2013).
