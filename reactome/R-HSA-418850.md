stable_id: R-HSA-418850
display_name: Activation of Cdc42
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RhoGEF complexed with Netrin-1-DCC induces guanine nucleotide exchange by
  Cdc42, activating it. Activated Cdc42 activates N-WASP, which promotes the nucleation
  of F-actin via the Arp2/3 complex. Netrin-1, via DCC, influences cellular motility
  by regulating actin-based membrane extension through the activation of Cdc42.
