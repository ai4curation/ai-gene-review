display_name: STAT1 and STAT4 associate with IL12RB2:IL6ST receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-35 (IL35) binding activates the IL35 receptor complex and facilitates
  JAKs phosphorylation. Subsequently, Signal transducer and activator of transcription
  1-alpha/beta (STAT1) and STAT4 bind to the receptor complex and are activated by
  tyrosine phosphorylation (Collison et al. 2012). This is a black box event because
  the receptor subunit responsible for STAT4 binding to the receptor is unclear. However,
  it is reported that simultaneous activation of IL12RB2 or IL6ST homodimer receptors
  do not promote the formation of pSTAT1:pSTAT4 and only the activation of the IL12RB2:IL6ST
  heteromeric receptor favours pSTAT1:pSTAT4 formation. For this reason, STAT1 and
  STAT4 are simultaneously considered in the binding, activation and release events.
