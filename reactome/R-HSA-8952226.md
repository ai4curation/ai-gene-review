display_name: RUNX3 binds the BCL2L11 (BIM) gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In response to TGF-beta treatment, RUNX3 binds to Runx response elements
  in the promoter of the BCL2L11 (BIM) gene. The BCL2L11 promoter contains three Runx
  response elements, one SMAD-binding site, and a binding site for FOXO3 (FOXO3A).
  The SMAD binding site is needed for RUNX3-mediated upregulation of BCL2L11 transcription
  and was shown to bind SMAD3 (Wildey et al. 2003). FOXO3 can bind to the BCL2L11
  promoter synergistically with RUNX3 and contribute to BCL2L11 stimulation (Yamamura
  et al. 2006).
