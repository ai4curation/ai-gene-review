stable_id: R-HSA-3108203
display_name: PRC1 SUMOylates CTBP1 with SUMO2,3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CBX4 (Pc2) via its SUMO-interacting motifs recruits both CTBP1 and SUMO2,3:UBE2I
  (SUMO1:UBC9) to polycomb bodies where CTBP1 is SUMOylated with SUMO2,3 at lysine-428,
  as inferred from SUMOylation with SUMO1 (Merrill et al. 2010, Yang and Sharrocks
  2010).
