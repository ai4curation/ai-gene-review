display_name: NS1 (1C) binds to Mediator complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the nucleus, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) nonstructural protein
  1C (NS1) binds to the Mediator complex through subunit MED25, but it also binds
  to other subunits. Mediator forms a bridge between transcription factors and the
  polymerase II complex. It is presently unclear how much binding of NS1 affects host
  gene transcription (Wu et al, 2012; Pei et al, 2021; Dong et al, 2022; Van Royen
  et al, 2022).

## Summary

In the nucleus, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) nonstructural protein 1C (NS1) binds to the Mediator complex through subunit MED25, but it also binds to other subunits. Mediator forms a bridge between transcription factors and the polymerase II complex. It is presently unclear how much binding of NS1 affects host gene transcription (Wu et al, 2012; Pei et al, 2021; Dong et al, 2022; Van Royen et al, 2022).
