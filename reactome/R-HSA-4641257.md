stable_id: R-HSA-4641257
display_name: Degradation of AXIN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AXIN is present in low concentrations in the cell and is considered to be
  the limiting component of the beta-catenin destruction complex in Xenopus; this
  may not be the case in mammalian cells, however (Lee et al, 2003; Tan et al, 2012).  Cellular
  levels of AXIN are regulated in part through ubiquitin-mediated turnover.  E3 ligases
  SMURF2 and RNF146 have both been shown to play a role in promoting the degradation
  of AXIN by the 26S proteasome (Kim and Jho, 2010; Callow et al, 2011; Zhang et al,
  2011).
