summary: The classical view of G-protein signalling is that the G-protein alpha subunit
  dissociates from the beta:gamma dimer. Activated G alpha (s) and the beta:gamma
  dimer then participate in separate signaling cascades. Although G protein dissociation
  has been contested (e.g. Bassi et al. 1996), recent in vivo experiments have demonstrated
  that dissociation does occur, though possibly not to completion (Lambert 2008).

## Summary

Activated G alpha (s) and the beta:gamma dimer then participate in separate signaling cascades.
