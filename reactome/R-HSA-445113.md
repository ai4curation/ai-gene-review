## Summary

Urotensin-II (U2) is a vasoactive 'somatostatin-like' cyclic peptide originally isolated from fish spinal cords. It was found to activate GPR14 later renamed Urotensin II receptor (U2R). 
<br>
U2 is the most potent known vasoconstrictor. A second ligand for U2R,  urotensin-related peptide or Urotensin 2B, was identified as an extract from rat brains, and shown to activate rat and human U2R.
