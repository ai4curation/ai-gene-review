display_name: Uncoupled eNOS favours the formation of superoxide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BH2 may compete with BH4 to bind eNOS, uncoupling eNOS leading to the formation
  of superoxide rather than nitric oxide. BH2, the oxidised form of BH4, cannot contribute
  electrons to heme in the reductase domain of eNOS, thereby uncoupling it from arginine
  oxidation and producing superoxide from oxygen instead (Vasquez-Vivar et al. 2002).
