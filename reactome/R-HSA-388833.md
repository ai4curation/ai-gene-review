stable_id: R-HSA-388833
display_name: Phosphorylation of CTLA-4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon TCR engagement, CTLA4 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by
  Src family kinases, including Fyn, Lyn, and Lck. These kinases phosphorylate key
  tyrosine residues, specifically Y201 and Y218, enabling interaction with Fyn through
  its SH2 domain (Marengere et al. 1996). Additionally, phosphorylation of Y165 on
  CTLA4 triggers the activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which subsequently
  dissociates from CTLA4. This dissociation of PP2A is associated with the inhibition
  of T cell activation, highlighting the regulatory role of CTLA4 in modulating T
  cell responses (Baroja et al. 2002).
