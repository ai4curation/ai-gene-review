display_name: Phosphorylated AKT1S1:mTORC1 binds YWHAB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AKT1S1 (PRAS40) phosphorylation by AKT at Thr246, or at  Ser183 by mTORC1,
  leads to the binding of YWHAB (14-3-3 beta) (Zhang et al. 2002, Kovacina et al.
  2003, Oshiro et al. 2007). As AKT1S1 suppresses mTORC1 phosphorylation of physiological
  substrates S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (Oshiro et al. 2007) binding of YWHAB is proposed to
  relieve this inhibition (Wang et al. 2012).

## Summary

AKT1S1 (PRAS40) phosphorylation by AKT at Thr246, or at  Ser183 by mTORC1, leads to the binding of YWHAB (14-3-3 beta) (Zhang et al. 2002, Kovacina et al. 2003, Oshiro et al. 2007). As AKT1S1 suppresses mTORC1 phosphorylation of physiological substrates S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (Oshiro et al. 2007) binding of YWHAB is proposed to relieve this inhibition (Wang et al. 2012).
