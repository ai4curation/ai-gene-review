summary: 'Interleukin-4 (IL4) is a principal regulatory cytokine during the immune
  response, crucially important in allergy and asthma (Nelms et al. 1999). When resting
  T cells are antigen-activated and expand in response to Interleukin-2 (IL2), they
  can differentiate as Type 1 (Th1) or Type 2 (Th2) T helper cells. The outcome is
  influenced by IL4. Th2 cells secrete IL4, which both stimulates Th2 in an autocrine
  fashion and acts as a potent B cell growth factor to promote humoral immunity (Nelms
  et al. 1999). <br><br>Interleukin-13 (IL13) is an immunoregulatory cytokine secreted
  predominantly by activated Th2 cells. It is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of
  allergic inflammation. IL13 shares many functional properties with IL4, stemming
  from the fact that they share a common receptor subunit. IL13 receptors are expressed
  on human B cells, basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts,
  monocytes, macrophages, respiratory epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, but
  unlike IL4, not T cells. Thus IL13 does not appear to be important in the initial
  differentiation of CD4 T cells into Th2 cells, rather it is important in the effector
  phase of allergic inflammation (Hershey et al. 2003).


  IL4 and IL13 induce “alternative activation” of macrophages, inducing an anti-inflammatory
  phenotype by signaling through IL4R alpha in a STAT6 dependent manner. This signaling
  plays an important role in the Th2 response, mediating anti-parasitic effects and
  aiding wound healing (Gordon & Martinez 2010, Loke et al. 2002)


  There are two types of IL4 receptor complex (Andrews et al. 2006). Type I IL4R (IL4R1)
  is predominantly expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells and consists of
  IL4R and IL2RG, the common gamma chain. Type II IL4R (IL4R2) is predominantly expressed
  on the surface of nonhematopoietic cells, it consists of IL4R and IL13RA1 and is
  also the type II receptor for IL13. (Obiri et al. 1995, Aman et al. 1996, Hilton
  et al. 1996, Miloux et al. 1997, Zhang et al. 1997). The second receptor for IL13
  consists of IL4R and Interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13RA2), sometimes called
  Interleukin-13 binding protein (IL13BP). It has a high affinity receptor for IL13
  (Kd = 250 pmol/L) but is not sufficient to render cells responsive to IL13, even
  in the presence of IL4R (Donaldson et al. 1998). It is reported to exist in soluble
  form (Zhang et al. 1997) and when overexpressed reduces JAK-STAT signaling (Kawakami
  et al. 2001). It''s function may be to prevent IL13 signalling via the functional
  IL4R:IL13RA1 receptor. IL13RA2 is overexpressed and enhances cell invasion in some
  human cancers (Joshi & Puri 2012).<br><br>The first step in the formation of IL4R1
  (IL4:IL4R:IL2RB) is the binding of IL4 with IL4R (Hoffman et al. 1995, Shen et al.
  1996, Hage et al. 1999). This is also the first step in formation of IL4R2 (IL4:IL4R:IL13RA1).
  After the initial binding of IL4 and IL4R, IL2RB binds (LaPorte et al. 2008), to
  form IL4R1. Alternatively, IL13RA1 binds, forming IL4R2. In contrast, the type II

  and IL13:IL4R:IL13RA1 complexes have been determined (LaPorte et al. 2008). Consistent
  with these structures, in monocytes IL4R is tyrosine phosphorylated in response
  to both IL4 and IL13 (Roy et al. 2002, Gordon & Martinez 2010) while IL13RA1 phosphorylation

  (Roy et al. 2002). IL2RG constitutively associates with JAK3 (Boussiotis et al.
  1994, Russell  et al. 1994). IL13RA1 constitutively associates with TYK2 (Umeshita-Suyama
