display_name: IL6:IL6R-2 binds IL6ST:JAK1, JAK2, (TYK2)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The complex of interleukin-6 (IL6) and the soluble, short form of the IL6
  receptor (IL6R-2) binds to surface expressed IL6ST (gp130), a process known as trans
  signaling (Rose-John et al. 2006). This process is negatively regulated by the soluble
  form of IL6ST (IL6ST-2).
