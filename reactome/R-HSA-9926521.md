stable_id: R-HSA-9926521
display_name: MITF-M-dependent BRCA1 gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BRCA1 expression is regulated by the binding of MITF-M dimer to an E-box
  in intron 1, and silencing of MITF with siRNA abrogates expression of BRCA1 in human
  501 Mel cells. (Strub et al, 2011; Beuret et al, 2011). BRCA1 expression may contribute
  to MITF-dependent suppression of DNA damage (Giuliano et al, 2010; reviewed in Goding
  and Arnheiter, 2019).
