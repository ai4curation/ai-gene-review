stable_id: R-SCE-9839836
display_name: YME1 degrades TIM10
species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
summary: Each monomer of YME1L1 contains a membrane proximal ATPase, protein unfolding
  domain and a membrane distal protease domain (Leonhard et al. 1996, Puchades et
  al. 2017). The substrate protein enters a central channel formed by the ATPase domains,
  where it is processively unfolded and translocated into the pore formed by the protease
  domains (Puchades et al. 2017). Within the protease pore, it is hydrolyzed by zinc
  cofactors bound to the protease domains (Puchades et al. 2017).
