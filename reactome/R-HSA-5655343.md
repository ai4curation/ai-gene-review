display_name: Activated FGFR2 mutants bind PLCG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Although it has not been rigourously established, there is some evidence
  that PLC-gamma signaling may be activated after autophosphorylation of some FGFR
  mutants, analagous to the wild type receptor (see for instance, Hart, 2000; Chen,
  2005; Cha, 2008; di Martino, 2009; Gartside, 2009; Cross, 2000; Hatch, 2006).  The
  extent to which each of the mutants activates this pathway and to which proliferation
  and tumorigenesis relies on PLC-gamma dependent signaling, remains to be more firmly
  established.
