stable_id: R-HSA-374701
display_name: Phosphorylation of DCC by Fyn
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Netrin-1 stimulates phosphorylation of DCC on serine, threonine, and tyrosine
  residues. The experimental data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC is
  a prerequisite step for DCC phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues. Fyn
  initiates the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue 1420 in the DCC cytoplasmic
  domain. This phosphorylation of DCC in turn facilitates the DCC-Fyn interaction,
  forming a positive reinforcement cycle.
