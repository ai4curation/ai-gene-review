stable_id: R-HSA-5637792
display_name: PLC-gamma 1 binds to p-EGFRvIII mutant
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Tyrosine residue Y992 (corresponding to Y1016 when counting from the first
  amino acid of the EGFR precursor, prior to cleavage of the 24-amino acid signal
  peptide at the N-terminus), a docking site for PLC-gamma 1 (PLCG1), is phosphorylated
  in EGFRvIII cancer mutant and expected to recruit PLC-gamma 1 in the same way as
  the wild-type EGFR receptor (Grandal et al. 2007).
