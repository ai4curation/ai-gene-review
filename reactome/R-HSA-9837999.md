summary: Mitochondrial proteases participate in proteostasis, the regulation of proteins
  to maintain a functional proteome, by degrading unfolded, unassembled, and oxidatively
  damaged proteins (reviewed in Ng et al. 2021, Song et al. 2021). Degradation of
  mitochondrial proteins by proteases also serves to regulate transcription by TFAM,
  oxidative phosphorylation by electron carriers, lipid translocation by PRELID1 and
  STARD7, and mitochondrial fission and fusion by OPA1 and OMA1 (reviewed in Ahola
  et al. 2019). Because of the bacterial origin of mitochondria, they contain a number
  of bacterial type proteases, including LONP1 in the matrix, CLPP:CLPX (CLPXP) in
  the matrix, HTRA2 (OMI) in the intermembrane space, AFG3L2 in the mitochondrial
  inner membrane and protruding into the matrix, and YME1L1 in the mitochondrial inner
  membrane and protruding into the intermembrane space (reviewed in Deshwal et al.
  2020, Szczepanowska and Trifunovic 2022).<br>The hexameric LONP1 complex, which
  is homologous to Lon proteases of eubacteria such as E. coli, binds substrate proteins
  in the matrix and inner membrane, unfolds them in an ATP-dependent mechanism, and
  degrades them (reviewed in Gibellini et al. 2020). LONP1 also acts as an ATP-dependent
  chaperone that is independent of its protease function (reviewed in Gibellini et
  al. 2020).<br>Like LONP1, the CLPXP complex unfolds matrix proteins in an ATP-dependent
  reaction and degrades them, however, the ATPase/unfolding function and the protease
  function are performed by separate subunits, with CLPX hexamers unfolding substrate
  proteins and translocating them to CLPP tetradecamers for processive degradation
  (reviewed in Mabanglo et al. 2021, Mabanglo and Houry 2022).<br>AFG3L2 (m-AAA+)
  forms either homohexamers or heterohexamers with its paralog SPG7 (Paraplegin) that
  are anchored in the mitochondrial inner membrane and protrude into the matrix (reviewed
  in Patron et al. 2018, Steele and Glynn 2019, Zhang and Mao 2020). The substrate
  protein enters the central channel formed by the ATPase domains of AFG3L2 and is
  unfolded and translocated to the pore formed by the protease domains, where it is
  degraded (reviewed inZhang and Mao 2020). <br>Like AFG3L2, YME1L1 (YME1L, i-AAA+)
  is a homohexameric complex that is anchored in the mitochondrial inner membrane,
  however, YME1L1 protrudes into the intermembrane space where it unfolds substrate
  proteins of the intermembrane space and inner membrane in an ATP-dependent reaction
  and then degrades them (reviewed in Steele and Glynn 2019, Ohba et al. 2020, Zhang
  and Mao 2020).<br>HTRA2 (OMI) forms soluble trimeric complexes in the intermembrane
  space that degrade substrate proteins, notably amyloid precursor proteins that are
  translocated to the intermembrane space and inner membrane. HTRA2 released from
  mitochondria into the cytosol also participates in regulating apoptosis (reviewed
  in Vande Walle et al. 2008).<br>Mutations in mitochondrial proteases cause diseases,
  such as spastic paraplegia (SPG7), ataxia (AFG3L2), and Parkinson's Disease (HTRA2),
