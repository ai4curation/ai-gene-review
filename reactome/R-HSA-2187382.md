display_name: Degradation of ubiquitinated SMAD3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SMAD3, ubiquitinated by STUB1 (CHIP), is degraded in a proteasome-dependent
  manner. STUB1-mediated downregulation of SMAD3 level happens in the absence of TGF-beta
  stimulation. STUB1 may therefore keep the basal level of SMAD3 low in the absence
  of TGF-beta signaling (Li et al. 2004, Xin et al. 2005).
