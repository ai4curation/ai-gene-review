display_name: VEGF-A,C,D bind to VEGFR2 leading to receptor dimerization
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'VEGFR-2 binds VEGF-A, -C, -D, and -E homodimers. VEGFR-2 is the primary
  mediator of the physiological effects of VEGF-A in angiogenesis, including microvascular
  permeability, endothelial cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and survival.
  In endothelial cells, these effects are mediated via activation of a phospholipase
  gamma-protein kinase C-Raf-MAPK signaling pathway for proliferation and PI3K and
  focal adhesion kinase for survival and migration.  VEGFR-2 is the important receptor
  among VEGFR protiens and its activation and signaling may be positively or negatively
  regulated by  co-expression and activation of various factors and other VEGF receptors
  like VEGFR-1  (Hicklin and Ellis 2005).The regulatory events of this receptor will
  be annotated in subsequent modules. '
