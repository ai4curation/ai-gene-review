display_name: GBF1 recruits ARF:GDP to the Golgi
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GBF1 recruits inactive ARF:GDP complexes to the Golgi (Monetta et al, 2007).
  There are 5 known ARFs in the human cell.  Class I members ARF1 and ARF 3 are expressed
  at high levels and broadly distributed through the secretory system, while Class
  II members ARF4 and 5 are expressed at lower levels. ARF6, the single Class III
  ARF, appears to function more specifically in endocytosis and actin dynamics (Chun
  et al, 2008; reviewed in D'Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006; Szul and Sztul, 2011).
  GBF1 has been shown to activate ARF1, 4, and 5, but not ARF3, while single and pairwise
  knockdown of ARF1, 3, 4 and 5 suggests that no single ARF is responsible for any
  given step in the secretory pathway (Manolea et al, 2010; Volpicelli-Daley et al,
  2005).
