species: Homo sapiens
summary: CatSper (CATionic channel of SPERm), a pH regulated, principal flagellar
  calcium ion channel. CatSper is a core regulator of sperm tail calcium entry and
  sperm motility. All CatSper subunits are sperm specific proteins and are located
  in the principal piece of the sperm flagellum. The sperm specific CatSper channel
  controls the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. Progesterone activates human CatSper,
  but not mouse, at low nanomolar concentrations by shifting the voltage dependency
  of the human CatSper channel into the physiological range. The pore of the CatSper
  channel is formed by four different CATSPER proteins (CATSPER 1,  2,  3, and -4)
  and all four are required for formation of the functional channel. In addition,
  three auxiliary subunits (CATSPERB, CATSPERG and CATSPERD) make this complex to
  be the one of the most sophisticated mammalian ion channels known. Only CATSPER1
  is believed to be regulated by pH. The absence of any of the pore-forming CATSPER
  proteins, or gamma or beta auxiliary subunits- leads to disappearance of the whole
  CatSper channel. Syndromic male infertility (SMI) in association with CATSPER mutations
  is described in a number of human gene mutation studies. The absence of CatSper
  channel leads to male infertility both in mice and humans.
