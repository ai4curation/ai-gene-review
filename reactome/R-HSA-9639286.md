species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Ragulator complex acts as an unconventional guanyl nucleotide exchange
  factor (GEF) that ejects GTP from RRAGC and, by inference, RRAGD (Shen and Sabatini
  2018). (Other known GEFs cause ejection of GDP rather than GTP from their targets.)
  The GDP-bound form of RRAGC,D is the active form that recruits mTORC1 to the lysosomal
  membrane.

## Summary

The Ragulator complex acts as an unconventional guanyl nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that ejects GTP from RRAGC and, by inference, RRAGD (Shen and Sabatini 2018). (Other known GEFs cause ejection of GDP rather than GTP from their targets.) The GDP-bound form of RRAGC,D is the active form that recruits mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane.
