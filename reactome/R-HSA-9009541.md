species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'TFF1 is an estrogen-responsive gene with an ESR1-bound promoter/enhancer
  that is primed for ligand-dependent expression by the binding of ''pioneer'' transcription
  factors, such as FOXA1 and GATA3 (Berry et al, 1989; Shang et al, 2000; Carroll
  et al, 2005; Laganière et al, 2005; Eeckhoute et al, 2006;  Hurtado et al, 2011;
  Theodorou et al, 2013; reviewed in Klinge, 2001; Zaret and Carroll, 2011; Fiorito
  et al, 2013). Ligand-bound estrogen receptor binds to a functional ERE between -405
  and -393 and to a region 10.5 kb upstream of the TFF1 transcription start site (Berry
  et al, 1989; Sewack and Hansen, 1997; Métivier et al, 2003; Carroll et al, 2005).


  Detailed ChIP studies of the TFF1 promoter in synchronized cells after estrogen
  stimulation reveal an ordered and cyclical recruitment of co-activators, chromatin
  remodellers and general transcriptional machinery that modify the epigenetic and
  chromatin environment to regulate transcriptional activity (Metivier et al, 2003;
  Metivier et al, 2008; Kangaspeska et al, 2008). Three phases are observed after
  estrogen stimulation of blocked cells, including an initial unproductive cycle followed
  by two transcriptionally productive cycles. These are marked by the combinatorial
  recruitment of different subsets of proteins and cyclical alterations to the methylation
  and acetylation status of the promoter (Metivier et al, 2003; Metivier et al, 2008;
  Kangaspeska et al, 2008; reviewed in Reid et al, 2009).'
