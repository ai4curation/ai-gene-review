display_name: PGR binds PGR antagonists
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The actions of progesterone, a critical regulator of normal female reproductive
  function  in the uterus, the ovary, the mammary gland and the brain, are mediated
  via the progesterone receptor (PGR). The PGR antagonists mifepristone and ulipristal
  acetate are indicated for the medical abortion of pregnancy and as an emergency
  contraceptive, respectively. They both work by preventing the effects of progesterone
  on PGR (Zhi et al. 2003, Lusher et al. 2012, Rewinkel et al. 2008).
