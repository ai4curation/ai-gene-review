summary: ABL1 (c-ABL), activated by ATM-mediated phosphorylation in response to DNA
  double-strand breaks (DSBs), phosphorylates RAD52 on tyrosine residue Y104, thus
  increasing the affinity of RAD52 heptamer for ssDNA and enhancing the efficiency
  of RAD52-mediated single strand annealing (SSA) (Honda et al. 2011).

## Summary

ABL1 (c-ABL), activated by ATM-mediated phosphorylation in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), phosphorylates RAD52 on tyrosine residue Y104, thus increasing the affinity of RAD52 heptamer for ssDNA and enhancing the efficiency of RAD52-mediated single strand annealing (SSA) (Honda et al. 2011).
