summary: <p>SGO1 (also known as SGOL1 or Shugoshin 1), a protein essential for cohesion
  of sister chromatids and proper seggregation of duplicated chromosomes during mitosis,
  was found to bind to CCNA2 specifically in G2 as compared with S phase (Pagliuca
  et al. 2011) and was reproducibly identified as a substrate of CCNA:CDK1 (Dumitru
  et al. 2017).</p><p>SGO1 was shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1 in vivo at an evolutionarily
  conserved consensus CDK1/2 site T346, and this site was shown to be phosphorylated
  in vitro by the CCNB1:CDK1 complex, while CCNA:CDK1 complexes were not tested as
  catalysts (Liu et al. 2013). CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of SGO1 facilitates SGO1-mediated
  recruitment of PP2A to the cohesin complex, thus preventing premature separation
