display_name: Dephosphorylation of CD3-zeta by PD-1 bound phosphatases
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PD-1 delivers inhibitory signals and downregulates antigen receptor signaling
  through the direct dephosphorylation of signaling intermediates. The phosphatases
  SHP-1 and SHP-2 play key roles in this process by dephosphorylating CD3ζ, which
  is a crucial component of the T cell receptor complex. This dephosphorylation inhibits
  the phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules, including ZAP-70 and PKCθ,
  leading to impaired T cell activation and function. By regulating these signaling
  pathways, PD-1 helps maintain immune tolerance and modulate the immune response
  (Chemnitz 1 et al. 2004).
