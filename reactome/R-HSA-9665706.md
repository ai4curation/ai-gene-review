display_name: Phosphorylated heterodimers of ERBB2 TMD/JMD mutants and EGFR bind PLCG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activation of downstream PLCG1 signaling was demonstrated for ERBB2 R678Q,
  through activating tyrosine phosphorylation on PLCG1 (Bose et al. 2013). It is assumed
  that the heterodimer of ERBB2 R678Q and EGFR, like the wild type ERBB2:EGFR heterodimer,
  binds PLCG1.
