stable_id: R-HSA-389941
display_name: SHP-1 and SHP-2 bind pBTLA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon BTLA activation, its phosphorylated tyrosine residues facilitate the
  recruitment of SH2-domain-containing phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2. While the specific
  targets of these phosphatases in BTLA signaling are not well-defined, they are thought
  to play a role in dephosphorylating signaling intermediates downstream of antigen
  receptors in lymphocytes or potentially modulate the PI3K-AKT pathway, impacting
  cell survival and immune response (Watanabe et al. 2003).
