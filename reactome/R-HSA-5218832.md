stable_id: R-HSA-5218832
display_name: CDC42:GTP binds PAK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The PAK family of serine/threonine kinases are known to be activated by binding
  to the GTP-bound form of CDC42 or RAC1, small GTPases of the Rho family that are
  involved in regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. PAK exists as
  homodimer in a trans-inhibited conformation. The kinase inhibitory (KI) domain of
  one PAK molecule binds to the C-terminal catalytic domain of the other and inhibits
  catalytic activity. Association of GTP-bound forms of CDC42 or RAC1 with the PAK
  PBD/CRIB domain induces conformational changes in the N-terminal domain that no
  longer support its autoinhibitory function. CDC42-mediated activation primes PAK2
  for superactivation by tyrosine phosphorylation (Renkema et al. 2002).
