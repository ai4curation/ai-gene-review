  in GG-NER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), as well as transcription-coupled
  nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), the DNA synthesis complex consisting of PCNA,
  RPA, RFC and polymerase delta (POLD) or epsilon (POLE) complexes performs DNA repair
  synthesis after the damaged DNA strand is incised 5' to the lesion by the endonuclease
  complex ERCC1:ERCC4 (ERCC1:XPF) and 3' to the lesion by the endonuclease XPG (ERCC5).
  Depending on damage-induced PCNA monoubiquitination, DNA polymerase kappa (POLK)
  is also involved in gap-filling DNA synthesis during nucleotide excision repair
  (NER) (Balajee et al. 1998, Staresincic et al. 2009, Ogi et al. 2010, Overmeer et
  al. 2011).
