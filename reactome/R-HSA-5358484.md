display_name: DPH5 transfers four methyl groups from AdoMet to aminocarboxypropyl
  EEF2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cytosolic diphthamide biosynthesis protein 5 (DPH5) transfers four methyl
  groups from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to elongation factor 2 (EEF2) whose histidine
  residue at position 715 has been conjugated with a 3-amino 3-carboxypropyl group,
  forming methylated diphthine EEF2 and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). DPH5 activity
  has been identified in cells of diverse eukaryotic species including humans and
  has been characterized in detail in budding yeast (Liu et al. 2004; Matteakis et
  al. 1992; Moehring & Moehring 1988).
