display_name: miR-205 microRNA binds PTEN mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'MicroRNA miR-205-5p, one of the two mature products of miR-205, binds the
  3''UTR of the PTEN mRNA, resulting in downregulation of PTEN mRNA and protein levels.
  miR-205 functions as part of both endonucleolytic and nonendonucleolytic RISCs (Qu
  et al. 2012, Cai et al. 2013). In addition to PTEN, miR-205 targets another negative
  regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling - the protein serine/threonine phosphatase PHLPP2
  (Cai et al. 2013). '

## Summary

MicroRNA miR-205-5p, one of the two mature products of miR-205, binds the 3'UTR of the PTEN mRNA, resulting in downregulation of PTEN mRNA and protein levels. miR-205 functions as part of both endonucleolytic and nonendonucleolytic RISCs (Qu et al. 2012, Cai et al. 2013). In addition to PTEN, miR-205 targets another negative regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling - the protein serine/threonine phosphatase PHLPP2 (Cai et al. 2013).
