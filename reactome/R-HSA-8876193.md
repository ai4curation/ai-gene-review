display_name: RIC1-RGP1 exchanges GTP for GDP on RAB6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The RIC1:RGP1 complex is a GEF for RAB6, the primary RAB in intra-Golgi trafficking.
  RAB6 also has roles in COPI-independent retrograde traffic from the Golgi to the
  ER.  Inactive RAB6:GDP is recruited to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) through interaction
  with RIC1:RGP1, and is subsequently activated by the RIC1:RGP1 GEF activity (Pusapati
  et al, 2012; Siniossoglou et al 2001; Siniossoglou et al, 2000; reviewed in Ishida
  et al, 2016). Interaction of RIC1:RGP1 with RAB6:GDP promotes release of GDP, allowing
  GTP to bind, and precludes the interaction of RAB6 with GDI and CHM proteins. Activated
  RAB6 nucleates a tethering complex at the TGN that is required for fusion of endosome-derived
  vesicles arriving at the late Golgi.  Typical cargo of the RAB6-dependent retrograde
  vesicles include resident TGN proteins such as TGOLN2 as well as Shiga, cholera
  and ricin toxins which use the retrograde trafficking machinery to 'hitchhike' back
  through the secretory system for release into the cytoplasm (Siniossoglou et al,
  2001; Liewen et al, 2005; Perez-Victoria et al, 2008; Perez-Victoria et al, 2009;
  reviewed in Bonaficino and Hierro, 2011; Johannes and Popoff, 2008; Pfeffer, 2011).<br><br>
