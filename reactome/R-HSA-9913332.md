summary: In the Golgi, the SGC interacts with alpha- and beta-dystroglycan (DAG1(30-653)
  and DAG1(654-895)) (Noguchi et al, 2000; reviewed in Tarakci and Bergman, 2016).
  DAG1 is autocatalytically proteolyzed during transit through the ER, yielding the

  of the C-terminal region of the alpha subunit with the N-terminal region of the
  beta subunit (Holt et al, 2000; Sciandra et al, 2001; Herzog et al, 2004; Akhavan
  et al, 2008). Alpha-DAG1 is additionally heavily glycosylated during transit through
  the secretory system (reviewed in Praissman and Wells, 2014). <br>In addition to
  alpha- and beta-dystroglycan, SSPN (sarcospan) is also recruited to the assembling
  complex in the Golgi. SSPN has four transmembrane segments and a large extracellular
  loop and is believed to mediate the interaction between the SGC and DAG1 complex
  (Crosbie et al, 1999; Crosbie et al, 2000).
