species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'After the fusion of phagosome and lysosome lumen acidity rises and the activity
  of lysosomal proteases increases, conferring proteolytic ability.  However antigens
  must be spared from complete proteolytic destruction. Dendritic cells (DCs) achieve
  this by regulating the level of proteolysis and phagosomal acidification. DCs recruit
  the NADPH oxidase NOX2 to the phagosome and mediate sustained production of low
  levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing active alkalization of the phagosomal
  lumen (Savina et al. 2006, Ramachandra et al. 2009). NOX2 consumes oxygen and protons
  (pumped by V-ATPase or other H+ voltage-gated channels) to produce ROS and this
  lowers phagosome acidity. This apparently reduces antigen proteolysis to a level
  that allows processing but does not fully destroy the antigenic peptides, favouring
  increased MHC-I cross presentation (Ramachandra et al. 2009). Rab27a controls the
  recruitment of NOX2 to DC phagosomes (Savina et al. 2007). '

## Summary

After the fusion of phagosome and lysosome lumen acidity rises and the activity of lysosomal proteases increases, conferring proteolytic ability.  However antigens must be spared from complete proteolytic destruction. Dendritic cells (DCs) achieve this by regulating the level of proteolysis and phagosomal acidification. DCs recruit the NADPH oxidase NOX2 to the phagosome and mediate sustained production of low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing active alkalization of the phagosomal lumen (Savina et al. 2006, Ramachandra et al. 2009). NOX2 consumes oxygen and protons (pumped by V-ATPase or other H+ voltage-gated channels) to produce ROS and this lowers phagosome acidity. This apparently reduces antigen proteolysis to a level that allows processing but does not fully destroy the antigenic peptides, favouring increased MHC-I cross presentation (Ramachandra et al. 2009). Rab27a controls the recruitment of NOX2 to DC phagosomes (Savina et al. 2007).
