display_name: CLN3 transports GalCer to plasma membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CLN3 (neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis 3) protein (battenin), which has five
  transmembrane domains, including a GalCer lipid raft-binding domain, is responsible
  for the transport of GalCer from ER/Golgi to lipid rafts in the membrane. The details
  of this process need to be clarified (Rusyn et al., 2008; reviewed by Liu & Li,
  2013). CLN3 transport of proteins and glycolipids to the plasma membrane and lysosomes
  is part of various processes. Deficiencies in CLN3 are the cause of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis
  3 (CLN3, "Batten's disease," MIM:204200; reviewed by Cotman & Staropoli, 2012; Mirza
  et al., 2019).
