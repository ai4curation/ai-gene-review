display_name: Defective pro-SFTPC does not translocate from ER membrane to multivesicle
  body
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Surfactant proteins (SFTPs) are trafficked from the ER membrane to lamellar
  bodies (LBs) via the multi-vesicle body (MVB). The pro-SFTPs B and C are cleaved
  here to produce functional SFTPs. Defects in the SFTPC gene result in protein misfolding,
  misrouting and/or misprocessing resulting in accumulation of partially-processed,
  inactive pro-SFTPC in alveoli causing cell toxicity. Defects in SFTPC can cause
  pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction 2 (SMDP2; MIM:610913), a rare lung disorder
  due to impaired surfactant homeostasis characterised by alveoli filling with floccular
  material. Cellular responses to the misfolded pro-SFTPC products include ER stress,
  the activation of reactive oxygen species and autophagy. Excessive lipoprotein accumulation
  in the alveoli results in a form of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants
  (RDS; MIM:267450). Mutations causing RDS that arrest the pro-protein in the ER include
  P30L and P115L (Thurm et al. 2013).

## Summary

Surfactant proteins (SFTPs) are trafficked from the ER membrane to lamellar bodies (LBs) via the multi-vesicle body (MVB). The pro-SFTPs B and C are cleaved here to produce functional SFTPs. Defects in the SFTPC gene result in protein misfolding, misrouting and/or misprocessing resulting in accumulation of partially-processed, inactive pro-SFTPC in alveoli causing cell toxicity. Defects in SFTPC can cause pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction 2 (SMDP2; MIM:610913), a rare lung disorder due to impaired surfactant homeostasis characterised by alveoli filling with floccular material.
