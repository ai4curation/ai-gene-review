species: Homo sapiens
summary: The CRB3:PALS1:PATJ complex is the second major cell polarity protein complex
  at tight junctions (TJs) (Shin et al., 2006). The integral membrane protein CRB3
  localizes to the apical domain of epithelial cells and is concentrated at TJs. CRB3
  directly associates with PALS1(MPP5) which interacts with PATJ, a protein consisting
  of 10 PDZ domains. The interaction with CRB3 might recruit the MPP5:PATJ complex
  to TJs (Lemmers et al., 2002; Roh et al., 2003). Although its precise functions
  of the individual components have not been established, the complex is required
  for TJ formation, in part through the stabilization of apical and lateral components
  of tight junctions (Michel et al., 2005; Shin et al., 2005).<p>Severe acute respiratory
