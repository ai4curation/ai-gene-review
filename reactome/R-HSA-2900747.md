stable_id: R-HSA-2900747
display_name: NOTCH1 HD+PEST domain mutants bind DLL4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: It has not been directly demonstrated that DLL4 binds to and activates NOTCH1
  HD (heterodimerization) domain mutants, but NOTCH1 HD domain mutants and in cis
  HD and PEST domain mutants of NOTCH1 are expected to respond to DLL4 like NOTCH1
  HD domain mutants respond to DLL1 (Malecki et al. 2006).
