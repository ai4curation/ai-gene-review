display_name: NUMB:ITCH bind and ubiquitnate GLI1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GLI1 is recruited to the NUMB:ITCH complex through a direct interaction with
  both proteins.  Once recruited, GLI1 is ubiquitinated by ITCH and subsequently degraded
  by the proteasome. ITCH-mediated degradation of GLI1 does not depend on the Dc or
  Dn degrons required for interaction with beta-TrCP, but instead relies on a novel
  PPXYs/pSP degron of GLI1 (di Marcotullio et al, 2006, 2011; Huntzicker et al, 2006).
  How these two apparently parallel systems of GLI1 ubiquitination and degradation
  are coordinated is not yet clear.
