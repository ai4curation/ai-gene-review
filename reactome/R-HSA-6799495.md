display_name: GLYCTK phosphorylates DGA to 3PDGA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: D-glyceric acid (DGA) is an intermediate of serine catabolism and of a minor
  pathway of fructose metabolism. The only known fate of DGA is phosphorylation to
  3-phospho-D-glyceric acid (3PDGA) by cytosolic glycerate kinase (GLYCTK) (Yu et
  al. 2006). Defects in GLYCTK can cause D-glyceric aciduria (D-GA; MIM:220120), a
  rare inborn error of serine and fructose metabolism where DGA is excreted in large
  amounts in the urine. A variable phenotype is observed, ranging from severe mental
  retardation and death to milder speech delays and normal development (Van Schaftingen
  1989, Sass et al. 2010).
