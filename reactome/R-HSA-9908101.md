## Summary

Upon dimerization of two half-proteasomes to form the preholoproteasome, the active site–bearing beta-subunits beta-1 (PSMB6), beta-2 (PSMB7), and beta-5 (PSMB5), undergo autocatalytic cleavage of their propeptides, generating the mature catalytic sites and completing the 20S core particle (20S CP) assembly (Schmidtke et al. 1997; Hirano et al. 2008; Adolf et al. 2024; reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). Although beta-6 (PSMB1) and beta-7 (PSMB4) also undergo proteolytic cleavage, their cleavage is not of crucial importance for the catalytic function of the 20S core particle (Hirano et al. 2008). PSMG1, PSMG2 and POMP undergo proteolytic degradation mediated by the proteolytic subunits of the inner ring, as reported in yeast (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013) and confirmed in human cells (Burri et al. 2000: absence of POMP from mature 20S CPs; Hirano et al. 2005: degradation of PSMG1 and PSMG2; Hirano et al. 2006: degradation of POMP, PSMG1 and PSMG2; Adolf et al. 2024: degradation of POMP precedes the degradation of PSMG1 and PSMG2).
