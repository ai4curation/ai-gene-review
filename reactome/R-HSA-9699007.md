## Summary

In a SARS-CoV-2 infection the cellular protease furin cleaves the spike protein at the S1/S2 site and that cleavage is essential for S-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung cells. The furin cleavage site promotes increased spike cleavage that has implications for pathogenesis (Hoffman et al. 2020; Johnson et al, 2021). Furin is associated with the plasma membrane of the host cell and mediates the hydrolytic cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein component of the viral membrane-associate S3:M:E:encapsidated SARS coronavirus genomic RNA: 7a:O-glycosyl 3a tetramer complex associated with ACE2.
