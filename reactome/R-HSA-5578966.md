stable_id: R-HSA-5578966
display_name: TNRC6A:AGO2:miRNA is transported into the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TNRC6A (GW182) possesses both a nuclear localization signal  (NLS) and a
  nuclear export signal (NES) that enable it to shuttle between the cytoplasm and
  the nucleus (Nishi et al. 2013). Thus the TNRC6A:AGO2:miRNA complex is transported
  into the nucleus by an unknown importation mechanism (Nishi et al. 2013). (TNRC6A
  is exported by Exportin 1.) The interaction between AGO2 and TNRC6A affects gene
  silencing activity in the nucleus (Nishi et al. 2013).
