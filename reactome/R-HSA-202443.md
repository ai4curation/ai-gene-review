species: Homo sapiens
summary: After the phosphorylation and activation CARMA1 undergoes oligomerization,
  likely through its CC domain. CARMA1 is thought to oligomerize first as a trimer
  which triggers downstream oligomerization cascade that is ultimately necessary for
  the subsequent activation of the IKK complex.
