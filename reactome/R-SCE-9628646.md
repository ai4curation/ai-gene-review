stable_id: R-SCE-9628646
display_name: SBH1:GET3:ADP binds GET1:GET2
species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
summary: The GET3:ADP dimer bound to a tail-anchored protein interacts with the receptor
  GET1:GET2 (Schuldiner et al. 2008, Stefer et al. 2011, Wang et al. 2011, Rome et
  al. 2014, Wang et al. 2014, Zalisko et al. 2017). Docking of GET3 causes a change
  in conformation of the GET3 dimer to an open state (Stefer et al. 2011) that is  stabilized
  by GET1 (Yamagata et al. 2010, Kubota et al. 2012) and releases the tail-anchored
  client protein to GET1 of the GET1:GET2 insertase (Wang et al. 2011, Wang et al.
  2014) .
