stable_id: R-MMU-9613545
display_name: Prkaa2 phosphorylates Plins
species: Mus musculus
summary: Lipophagy is the process of autophagic degradation of lipid droplets into
  fatty acids. Lipid droplets are coated with perilipin (Plin) proteins and they need
  to be eliminated for the degradation of the lipids inside. Cytosolic Heat shock
  cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) binds Plin2 and Plin3 on the lipid droplet surface.
  Subsequently, Prkaa2 binds and phosphorylates perilipins targeting them for lipophagy
  (S Kaushik et al. 2015, S Kaushik et al. 2016). The precise phosphorylation site(s)
  on Plins are unknown.
