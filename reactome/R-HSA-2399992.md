stable_id: R-HSA-2399992
display_name: AKT1 E17K mutant phosphorylates forkhead box transcription factors
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AKT1 E17K gain-of-function mutant phosphorylates FOXO3 (Carpten et al. 2007),
  and is expected to phosphorylate other forkhead box transcription factor family
  members, FOXO1 and FOXO4, and possibly FOXO6, like the wild-type AKT (Brunet et
  al. 1999, Rena et al. 1999, Matsuzaki et al. 2005), but this has not been experimentally
  tested.
