stable_id: R-HSA-3321883
display_name: MSL acetylates histone H4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The MSL complex has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity with a high
  specificity for histone H4 lysine-17 (H4K16) (Smith et al. 2000, 2005, Conrad et
  al. 2012). The subunit responsible for this activity is KAT8 (Males Absent on the
  First, MOF) a member of the MYST (named for yeast and human members MOZ, YBF2, SAS2,
  and Tip60) HAT family. In Drosophilla, the MSL complex associates at hundreds of
  sites along the X chromosome in somatic cells, resulting in the hyperacetylation
  of H4K16 (Lavender et al. 1994, Smith et al. 2000). In humans MSL is responsible
  for the majority of H4 acetylation at lysine-17 in the cell. KAT8 is a component
  of other complexes (Smith et al. 2005, Mendjan et al. 2006, Cai et al. 2010).
