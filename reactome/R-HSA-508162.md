display_name: BH3 only proteins associate with and inactivate anti-apoptotic BCL-XL
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BH3-only proteins (tBid, BIM, PUMA, BAD, NOXA) associate with and inactivate
  anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL( Yi et al., 2003; Puthalakath et al., 1999;  Nakano
  and Vousden, 2001; Wang et al., 1999; Oda et al., 2000). The interactions of NOXA
  with Bcl-XL are inferred from experiments performed in mice (Oda et al., 2000).
