stable_id: R-HSA-113407
display_name: DSIF complex binds to RNA Pol II (hypophosphorylated)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DSIF is a heterodimer consisting of hSPT4 (human homolog of yeast Spt4- p14)
  and hSPT5 (human homolog of yeast Spt5-p160).  DSIF association with Pol II may
  be enabled by Spt5 binding to Pol II  creating a scaffold for NELF binding (Wada
  et al.,1998). Spt5 subunit of DSIF can be phosphorylated by P-TEFb.
