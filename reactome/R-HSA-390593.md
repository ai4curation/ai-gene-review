# ATP Hydrolysis By Myosin
**Reactome ID:** [R-HSA-390593](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-390593)
**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

The cleft closes like a clam shell around the ATP molecule, triggering a large shape change that causes the myosin head to release actin and be displaced along the actin filament by a distance of about 5 nm. Hydrolysis of ATP occurs, but the ADP remains tightly bound to the protein.
