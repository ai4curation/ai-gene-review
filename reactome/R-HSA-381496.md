species: Homo sapiens
summary: IGFBP3 binds IGF I or IGF II via the conserved N terminus and C terminus
  of IGFBP 3. IGFBP3 also binds ALS via the C terminal portion of IGFBP3. The interaction
  is dependent on the glycosylation of ALS.<br>IGFBP3, which binds most IGF in the
  body, is enriched in follicular fluid and found in many other tissues. IGFBP3 may
  be cleaved by plasmin, thrombin, Prostate specific Antigen (PSA, KLK3), Matrix Metalloprotease-1
  (MMP1), and Matrix Metalloprotease-2 (MMP2). IGFBP3 also binds extracellular matrix
  and binding lowers its affinity for IGFs. IGFBP3 stimulates the effects of IGFs.<br>
