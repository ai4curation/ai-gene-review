display_name: HILPDA binds lipid droplets
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated protein (HILPDA aka HIG2) was
  first described as a novel gene inducible by hypoxia and glucose deprivation, but
  its function and mechanisms of regulation remain unknown.  HILPDA is a novel lipid
  droplet (LD) protein and stimulates intracellular lipid accumulation, which may
  play an important functional role in diseases associated with pathological lipid
  accumulation (Gimm et al. 2010, Carr & Ahima 2016).
