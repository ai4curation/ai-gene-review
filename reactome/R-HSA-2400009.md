species: Homo sapiens
summary: A variety of inhibitors capable of blocking the phosphoinositide kinase activity
  of PI3K have been developed. These inhibitors display differential selectivity and
  inhibit kinase activity of their substrates by distinct mechanisms. For example,
  the first-generation PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Wymann et al. 1996) covalently and
  irreversibly binds all classes of PI3K enzymes, as well as other kinases including
  mTOR, at a residue critical for catalytic activity. Although wortmannin is precluded
  from in vivo and clinical use due to its toxicity, it has proven to be a useful
  tool for in vitro laboratory studies. Newer inhibitors, such as BEZ235, are currently
  being investigated in Phase I clinical trials. BEZ235 is a dual pan-class I PI3K/mTOR
  inhibitor that blocks kinase activity by binding competitively to the ATP-binding
  pocket of these enzymes (Serra et al. 2008, Maira et al. 2008). BGT226 (Chang et
  al. 2011) and XL765 (Prasad et al. 2011) also inhibits both PI3K class I enzymes
  and mTOR. Other inhibitors in clinical trials, such as BKM120 (Maira et al. 2012),
  GDC0941 (Folkes et al. 2008, Junttila et al. 2009) and XL147 (Chakrabarty et al.
  2012), are specific for class I PI3Ks and exhibit no activity against mTOR. Current
  research aims to identify isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors. Small molecule inhibitors
  that selectively inhibit PIK3CA (p110alpha), e.g. PIK-75 and A66, were used to study
  the role of p110alpha in signaling and growth of tumor cells (Knight et al. 2006,
  Sun et al. 2010, Jamieson et al. 2011, Utermark et al. 2012). The PIK3CB (p110beta)
  specific inhibitor TGX221 has been used in in vitro models of vascular injury (Jackson
  et al. 2005), and the TGX221 derivative KIN-193 has been shown to block AKT activity
  and tumor growth in mice with p110beta activation or PTEN loss (Ni et al. 2012).
  CAL-101 is a PIK3CD (p110delta) specific inhibitor that is being clinically investigated
  as a therapeutic for lymphoid malignancies (Herman et al. 2010). It is hoped that,
  in the future, more specific inhibitors, such as those targeting selective PI3K
  isoforms, will provide optimum treatment while minimizing unwanted side effects.

## Summary

A variety of inhibitors capable of blocking the phosphoinositide kinase activity of PI3K have been developed. These inhibitors display differential selectivity and inhibit kinase activity of their substrates by distinct mechanisms. For example, the first-generation PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Wymann et al. 1996) covalently and irreversibly binds all classes of PI3K enzymes, as well as other kinases including mTOR, at a residue critical for catalytic activity. Although wortmannin is precluded from in vivo and clinical use due to its toxicity, it has proven to be a useful tool for in vitro laboratory studies.

BEZ235 is a dual pan-class I PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that blocks kinase activity by binding competitively to the ATP-binding pocket of these enzymes (Serra et al. 2008, Maira et al. 2008).
