  loss-of-function of PALB2 in binding to BRCA2/RAD51/RAD51C
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The WD40 domain located in the C-terminus of PALB2, between amino acid residues
  853-1186, enables binding of PALB2 to BRCA2, RAD51, RAD51C, RNF168 and POLN (Luijsterburg
  et al. 2017, Buisson 2014). The synthetic truncation mutant of PALB2, PALB2deltaC,
  which ends at the proline residue P1097, lacks blades 5-7 of the WD40 domain and
  is completely unable to interact with RAD51C, RAD51 and BRCA2 (Park et al. 2014).
  Truncating nonsense and frameshift mutations in <i>PALB2</i> that entirely or partially
  perturb the WD40 domain, as well as missense mutations in the WD40 domain are found
  in cancer (including familial breast cancer) and Fanconi anemia patients and are
  associated with impaired PALB2 binding to BRCA2, RAD51 and/or RAD51C, impaired assembly
  of RAD51 DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair foci, defective homologous recombination
  repair (HRR), and cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents such as mitomycin
  C (Erkko et al. 2007, Tischkowitz et al. 2007, Xia et al. 2007, Zhang et al. 2007,
  Park et al. 2014, Foo et al. 2017, Rodrigue et al. 2019, Boonen et al. 2019, Wiltshire
  et al. 2020). The WD40 domain is also important for PALB2 stability, as the PALB2
  Y1183* mutant, which lacks the last four amino acids of PALB2, does not fold completely
  and is thus susceptible to degradation (Reid et al. 2007, Oliver et al. 2009). Many
  of the characterized missense mutations in the WD40 domain are associated with reduced
  PALB2 protein levels, thought to be due to reduced protein stability (Boonen et
  al. 2019, reviewed in Boonen et al. 2020). In addition, this domain also contains,
  buried within the propeller structure, a nuclear export signal (NES). Some of the
  WD40 missense mutants of PALB2 show moderate to significant cytosolic accumulation,
  possibly due to unmasking of the C terminal nuclear export signal (Rodrigue et al.
  2019). The cancer mutant PALB2 W1038* is mislocalized to the cytoplasm, which impacts
  the functionality of PALB2 (Pauty et al. 2017). The following missense mutants described
  below also show mislocalization to the cytoplasm: PALB2 I944N, PALB2 L1070P, PALB2
  L947F, PALB2 L947S, PALB2 T1030I, PALB2 G1043A, PALB2 L1119P and PALB2 W1140G (Wiltshire
  et al. 2019, Rodrigue et al. 2019).<br><br>The following PALB2 missense mutations

  PALB2 A1025R has normal expression level, it is impaired in homologous recombination
  (Boonen et al. 2019), confirming previous studies that showed an impaired interaction
  with BRCA2 (Oliver et al. 2009, Rodrigue et al. 2019, Wiltshire et al. 2020).<br><br>The
  following truncation (nonsense and frameshift) mutants on PALB2 were shown to be

  first identified in a Fanconi anemia patient, is unable to interact with BRCA2,
  RAD51C and largely with RAD51 (Xia et al. 2007, Park et al. 2014); it was also shown
  to be defective in HRR (Boonen et al. 2019, Wiltshire et al. 2020) and to confer
  sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Boonen et al. 2019).<br>PALB2 L531Cfs*3 frameshift
  mutant (c.1592delT), frequently present in Finnish familial breast cancer cases,
  has little BRCA2 binding capacity and is defective in homologous recombination repair
  and crosslink repair (Erkko et al. 2007).<br>Two additional frameshift mutants of
  PALB2 associated with a strong family history of breast cancer and impaired in their
  ability to bind to BRCA2 are:<br>PALB2 C77Vfs100* (Tischkowitz et al. 2007)<br>PALB2

  of PALB2 have been shown to be functionally impaired in HRR but their ability to
  bind to BRCA2, RAD51 or RAD51C, or to form RAD51 foci, has not been tested (as indicated),
  or they are predicted to be pathogenic and share sequence similarity with functionally
  studied PALB2 mutants:<br>PALB2 L972Q (Boonen et al. 2019: decreased protein stability,

  and PALB2 G1043D)<br>PALB2 L1172P (Boonen et al. 2019: decreased protein stability,
  defective HRR, sensitivity to PARP inhibitors)<br><br>Based on their similarity
  with the synthetic PALB2deltaC mutant, truncation mutants of PALB2 derived from
  COSMIC database (Forbes et al. 2017) which have not been functionally studied and
  whose amino acid sequence terminates before the terminal P1097 residue of PALB2deltaC,
  are annotated as candidate loss-of-function mutants for BRCA2, RAD51 and RAD51C
  binding. Several truncation mutants in PALB2 that have been reported in Fanconi
  anemia and/or hereditary breast cancer are also annotated as candidates (Reid et
  al. 2007, Rahman et al. 2007). In addition, several PALB2 truncation mutants that
  were shown to be functionally impaired in HRR, but whose ability to bind to BRCA2,
  RAD51 or RAD51C has not been tested are also annotated as candidates (reviewed in

## Summary

The WD40 domain located in the C-terminus of PALB2, between amino acid residues 853-1186, enables binding of PALB2 to BRCA2, RAD51, RAD51C, RNF168 and POLN (Luijsterburg et al. 2017, Buisson 2014). The synthetic truncation mutant of PALB2, PALB2deltaC, which ends at the proline residue P1097, lacks blades 5-7 of the WD40 domain and is completely unable to interact with RAD51C, RAD51 and BRCA2 (Park et al. 2014). Truncating nonsense and frameshift mutations in <i>PALB2</i> that entirely or partially perturb the WD40 domain, as well as missense mutations in the WD40 domain are found in cancer (including familial breast cancer) and Fanconi anemia patients and are associated with impaired PALB2 binding to BRCA2, RAD51 and/or RAD51C, impaired assembly of RAD51 DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair foci, defective homologous recombination repair (HRR), and cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents such as mitomycin C (Erkko et al. 2007, Tischkowitz et al. 2007, Xia et al. 2007, Zhang et al. 2007, Park et al. 2014, Foo et al. 2017, Rodrigue et al. 2019, Boonen et al. 2019, Wiltshire et al. 2020).
