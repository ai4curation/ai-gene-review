stable_id: R-HSA-9712081
display_name: ALK fusions bind FRS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NPM-ALK binds to FRS2 and FRS3 as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation from
  HEK293 cells. FRS proteins bind through three distinct sites, two of which (Y156
  and Y567) are dependent on ALK tyrosine phosphorylation, while the third site encompassing
  residues 631-649 is phosphorylation independent.  All three sites contribute to
  NPM-ALK-mediated transformation (Chikamori et al, 2007; Koshiba et al, 2010). FRS
  adaptor proteins may contribute to transformation by activating the MAP kinase or
  PI3K pathways but this has not been directly demonstrated in the case of ALK or
  ALK fusion signaling (reviewed in Palmer et al, 2009; Gotoh, 2008, Sato and Gotoh,
  2009).
