display_name: Phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser727
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Kinases like Protein kinase C delta (PKC-delta) and Calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II (CaMK II ) can phosphorylate STAT1 at serine 727 (S727). This
  phosphorylation is not required for STAT1 homodimer formation, nuclear translocation
  and DNA binding. However, it is essential for the full transcriptional activation
  of STAT1.
