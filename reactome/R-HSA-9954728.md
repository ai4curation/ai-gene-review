display_name: The proteasome degrades the K48-polyubiquitinated alanine-tailed nascent
  peptide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The K48-polyubiquitinated nascent peptide is proteolytically degraded by
  the 26S proteasome (Thrun et al. 2021). During the process the PSMD2, ADRM1, and
  PSMD4 subunits of the 26S proteasome complex bind K48-linked polyubiquitin conjugated
  to the substrate protein (reviewed in Bard et al. 2018). The PSMD14 subunit of the
  26S proteasome deubiquitnates the substrate protein, and the ATP-driven motor activity
  of the 26S proteasome feeds the substrate protein into the central pore of the proteasome,
  where the substrate protein is degraded (reviewed in Bard et al. 2018).
