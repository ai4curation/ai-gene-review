display_name: RUNX3 binds the RUNX1 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RUNX3, presumably associated with CBFB, binds Runx response elements in the
  distal (P1) promoter of the RUNX1 gene (Spender et al. 2005). All RUNX family members
  contain Runx response elements in their promoters (Levanon and Groner 2004).
