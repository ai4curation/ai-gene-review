display_name: Formation of Ragulator complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A complex of LAMTOR1 to 5, known as Ragulator, interacts with Rag GTPases
  recruiting them to lysosomes, an essential step in mTORC1 activation (Sancak et
  al. 2010). LAMTOR1 is probably myristoylated and/or  palmitoylated to enhance its
  assocation with the lysosomal surface, acting as a platform for the other members
  of the compex. Lamtor1 (Nada et al. 2009) and Lamtor2 (Teis et al. 2006) knockout
  mice exhibit severe growth retardation, severe defects in intracellular organelle
  organization and embryonic lethality. Partial reduction of LAMTOR2 in humans leads
  to reduced height (Bohn et al. 2007).

LAMTOR1 is probably myristoylated and/or  palmitoylated to enhance its assocation with the lysosomal surface, acting as a platform for the other members of the compex.
