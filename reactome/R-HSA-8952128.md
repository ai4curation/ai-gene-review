stable_id: R-HSA-8952128
display_name: RUNX3 binds TP53
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RUNX3 can bind to TP53 (p53). The interaction involves the C-termini of both
  RUNX3 and TP53. RUNX3 may act as a TP53 co-factor, stimulating TP53-mediated transcription
  of target genes, including CDKN1A (p21). RUNX3 may also interact with phosphorylated
  ATM kinase in response to DNA damage and facilitate ATM-mediated phosphorylation
  and stabilization of TP53 (Yamada et al. 2010).
