stable_id: R-HSA-937034
display_name: IRAK1 phosphorylates Pellino
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Both IRAK1 and IRAK4 were shown to phosphorylate Pellino isoforms in vitro.
  The phosphorylation of Pellino proteins is a necessary step in enhancing of their
  E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. It remains unclear whether IRAK1(as shown here), IRAK4,
  or both protein kinases mediate the activation of Pellino isoforms in vivo.
