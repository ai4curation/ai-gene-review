display_name: GPIb:IX:V binds to VWF multimer:collagen
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The initial tethering of platelets at sites of vascular injury is mediated
  by the platelet receptor complex of glycoproteins Ibα, IX and V (GPIbα:IX:V, frequently
  referred to as the GPIb receptor). GPIbα, encoded by the GP1BA gene, binds to von
  Willebrand factor (VWF), which is complexed with collagen exposed in vascular epithelium
  following injury (Mody NA &King MR 2008). Shear-induced interaction between VWF
  and collagen leads to exposure of the A1 domain of VWF to allow binding to GPIbα
  (Dumas JJ et al., 2004; Ju L et al., 2013). Thus, the damaged vessel wall and platelets
  interactions are facilitated by VWF multimer, which under normal physiological flow
  conditions circulates in a folded, inactive form, which does not interact with platelets
  due to autoinhibitory regulation (Aponte-Santamaria C et al., 2015; Butera D et
  al., 2018; Arce NA et al., 2021; Zhao YC et al., 2022). However, under conditions
  of high shear stress, when a blood vessel is partially blocked, VWF can bind to
  GP1bα:V:IX in the absence of collagen causing thrombotic diseases like heart attack
  and stroke (reviewed by Mehta R et al., 2019; Kozlov S et al., 2022). <p>This Reactome
  event describes GPIbα:IX:V interaction with VWF:collagen that potentiates the binding
  of platelet-associated integrin αIIbβ3 to VWF and fibrinogen, triggering stable
