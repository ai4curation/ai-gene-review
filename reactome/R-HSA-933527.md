display_name: Recruitment of TBK1/IKK epsilon complex to TANK:TRAF6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TANK acts as an adapter protein and regulates the assembly of TBK1/IKK epsilon
  complex with upstream signaling molecules. SIKE (for Suppressor of IKKepsilon) interacts
  with IKKepsilon and TBK1. SIKE is associated with TBK1 under physiological condition
  and dissociated from TBK1 upon viral infection. Overexpression of SIKE disrupted
  the interactions of IKKepsilon or TBK1 with RIG-1.
