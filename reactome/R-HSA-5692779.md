display_name: p-T182 MAPKAPK5 phosphorylates FOXO1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MAPKAPK5 phosphorylates FOXO1 at S218 (corresponds to S215 in mouse Foxo1).  This
  phosphorylation is essential for the FOXO1-dependent activation of RAG gene transcription
  during B-cell development and promotes the direct binding of FOXO1 to the RAG gene
  promoter (Chow et al, 2013).
