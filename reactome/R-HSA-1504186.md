display_name: DVL recruits GSK3beta:AXIN1 to the receptor complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The DIX domains of DVL and AXIN interact and this interaction brings GSK3beta:AXIN1
  to the receptor complex (Schwarz-Romond et al, 2007).  Subsequently, sequential
  phosphorylation of LRP5/6 by GSK3beta and CSNK1 generates high affinity AXIN binding
  sites and functions to amplify recruitment to the membrane (Mao et al, 2001; Zeng
  et al, 2008).  In some models, this recruitment of AXIN to the membrane is facilitated
  by clustering of DVL and/or LRP5/6 into a 'signalosome' (Bilic et al, 2007).
