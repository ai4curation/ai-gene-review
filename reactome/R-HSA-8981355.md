stable_id: R-HSA-8981355
display_name: RASA1 binds RAS:GTP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The human genome encodes at least 10 proteins that bind RAS and activate
  its intrinsic GTPase activity, resulting in the formation of inactive RAS:GDP and
  attenuating RAS signaling (reviewed in King et al, 2013). One of the identified
  RAS GAP proteins is RASA1, also known as p120 GAP. GAP proteins stimulate RAS GTPase
  activity by inserting a conserved arginine residue into the RAS active site, promoting
  a conformational change in the active site to allow GTP hydrolysis (Ahamdian et
  al, 2003; Scheffzek et al, 1997; Ahamdian et al, 1997). In addition to the GAP domain,
  most RAS GAP proteins also contain membrane targeting domains that facilitate interaction
  with the plasma membrane where RAS is tethered.  In some cases, such as RASA3, membrane
  localization is constitutive, whereas in others, the GAP proteins are targeted to
  the membrane in response to cellular signaling.  In addition to binding RAS, a number
  of GAP proteins also mediate other protein-protein interactions and act as scaffolds
  to integrate signaling; some GAPs are also known to bind and activate other small
  GTPases such as RAP (reviewed in King et al, 2013).  Loss-of-functions mutations
  in RAS GAP proteins have been identified in a number of cancers (reviewed in Maertens
  and Cichowski, 2014).
