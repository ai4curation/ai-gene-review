stable_id: R-HSA-5638014
display_name: RAB11A:GTP-containing Golgi vesicles recruit RAB3IP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The RAB8 guanine nucleotide exchange factor RAB3IP/RABIN8 is recruited to
  vesicles through interaction with membrane-tethered RAB11:GTP (Westlake et al, 2011;
  Knodler et al, 2010).  Recruitment of RAB3IP may also depend on the TRAPPCII complex,
  a multiprotein complex with roles in vesicular trafficking (Westlake et al, 2011;
  reviewed in Sacher et al, 2008). RAB3IP is required for RAB8A to localize to the
  cilium, and depletion of RAB3IP compromises cilia formation (Nachury et al, 2007;
  Loktev et al, 2008). GTP-bound RAB8A may promote ciliogenesis by promoting the traffic
  of post-Golgi vesicles to the base of the cilium (Nachury et al, 2007; Westlake
  et al, 2011; Feng et al, 2012; reviewed in Reiter et al, 2012)
