display_name: NEUROG3-dependent synthesis of NEUROD1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The NEUROD1 gene is transcribed, its mRNA is translated, and the protein
  product is transported to the nucleus. NEUROD1 transcription requires the activity
  of the NEUROG3 transcription factor (Heremans et al. 2002; Mellitzer et al. 2006).
