stable_id: R-HSA-202111
display_name: AKT1 phosphorylates eNOS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HSP90 serves as a scaffold to promote productive interaction between AKT1
  and eNOS.  Due to the proximity of these proteins once complexed with HSP90, AKT1
  phosphorylates eNOS at Ser1177.  When Ser1177 is phosphorylated, the level of NO
  production is elevated two- to three-fold above basal level.
