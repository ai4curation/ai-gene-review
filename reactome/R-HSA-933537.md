stable_id: R-HSA-933537
display_name: Recruitment of TANK to TRAF6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRAF family member-associated NF-kappaB activator (TANK, also known as I-TRAF)
  plays an important role in IFN induction through both RIG-I and Toll-like receptor-dependent
  pathways. TANK has been identified as a TRAF6 binding protein. Transient transfection
  experiments in 293T cells revealed that TRAF6 associates with MAVS (IPS-1), TBK1,
  IKBKE (IKKi), and TANK (Konno et al. 2009).
