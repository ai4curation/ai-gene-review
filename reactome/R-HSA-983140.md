stable_id: R-HSA-983140
display_name: Transfer of Ub from E2 to substrate and release of E2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interaction of E3 with both substrate and E2-Ub, brings them into proximity
  so that ubiquitin is transferred from E2 to the substrate. In most cases the transfer
  of ubiquitin is direct from E2 to substrate, but in a small subset of E3s, it occurs
  via a covalent E3-Ub thioester intermediate (Raymond et al. 2009).
