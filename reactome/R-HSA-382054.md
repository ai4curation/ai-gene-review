display_name: PDGF binds to extracellular matrix proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The long splice version of the PDGF-A chain as well as the COOH-terminal
  part of the PDGF-B precursor contain C-terminal protein motifs that confer retention
  of the secreted factors. In both the PDGF A- and B-chains, exon 6 encodes a basic
  sequence that mediates interaction with components of the extracellular matrix.
  PDGF binds to various types of collagens, thrombospondin and osteopontin; however,
  the major component of the matrix involved in PDGF binding is likely to be haparan
  sulphate. The negatively charged sulfate groups on the disaccharide building blocks
  of heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharide chains provide binding sites for positively
  charged amino acid sequence motifs. <br>The precursor of the B-chain may be retained
  in the matrix; after maturation when the COOH-terminal retention sequence has been
  cleaved off, the molecule may become more diffusible.
