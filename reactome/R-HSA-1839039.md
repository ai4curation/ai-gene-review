  phosphorylation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In a murine mouse model of ZNF198-FGFR1-induced EMS, treatment with the FGFR-inhibitor
  Midostaurin (PKC412) resulted in prolonged survival (Chen, 2004).  Similarly, growth
  of ZNF-198-FGFR1-, FGFR1OP2-FGFR1-, and BCR-FGFR1-expressing lines is blocked by
  treatment with FGFR-inhibitors (Demiroglu, 2001; Gu, 2006; Chase, 2007; Zhen, 2007;
