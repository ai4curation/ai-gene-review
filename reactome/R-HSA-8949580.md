display_name: F1Fo ATP synthase dimerizes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: At the inner mitochondrial membrane, an F1Fo ATP synthase complex binds another
  F1Fo ATP synthase complex to form a dimer that causes curvature of the inner mitochondrial
  membrane at internal regions of cristae (Habersetzer et al. 2013, inferred from
  bovine homologs in Strauss et al. 2008, Davies et al. 2011, Davies et al. 2012,
  inferred from yeast homologs in Arnold et al. 1998, Couoh-Cardel et al. 2010). The
  dimers are observed in rows along the highly curved apices of cristae (inferred
  from bovine homologs in Davies et al. 2014).
