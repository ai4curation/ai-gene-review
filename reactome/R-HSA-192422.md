display_name: Digestion of triacylglycerols by extracellular PTL:colipase
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Pancreatic lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of extracellular triacylglycerols
  to yield diacylglycerols and long-chain fatty acids. The enzyme is active only when
  complexed with colipase protein and plays a major role in the digestion of dietary
  triacylglycerols in the small intestine (Carriere et al. 2000; Giller et al. 1992).
