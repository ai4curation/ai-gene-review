display_name: Cdk5:p25 phosphorylates lamin B1
species: Mus musculus
summary: In a mouse Alzheimer's disease model, nuclear fragmentation, which precedes
  neuronal death, is initiated by phosphorylation of nuclear lamins by p25-activated
  Cdk5. The Cdk5:p25 complex phosphorylates lamin B1 (Lmnb1) at serine residues S24
  and S394 (Chang et al. 2011), corresponding to S23 and S393 of human LMNB1, respectively.
