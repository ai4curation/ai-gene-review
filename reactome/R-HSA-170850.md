display_name: Phosphorylated SMAD2/3 dissociates from TGFBR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon phosphorylation of the R-SMAD (SMAD2/3), the conformation of the C-terminal
  (MH2) domain of the R-SMAD changes, lowering its affinity for the type I receptor
  and ZFYVE9 (SARA). As a result, the phosphorylated R-SMAD dissociates from the activated
  receptor complex (TGFBR).
