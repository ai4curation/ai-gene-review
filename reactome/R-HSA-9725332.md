stable_id: R-HSA-9725332
display_name: MYC/MYCN bind the ALK gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MYC and MYCN bind to E boxes in the ALK promoter region to drive ALK gene
  expression as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assays
  (Hasan et al, 2013). In turn, other studies have identified MYCN as a target of
  activated ALK in neuroblastoma, suggesting the ALK and MYCN may cooperate in driving
  progression of this disease (Schonherr et al, 2012; De Brouwer et al, 2010; Montavon
  et al, 2014; reviewed in Hallberg and Palmer, 2013)
