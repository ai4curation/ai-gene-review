stable_id: R-MMU-9009867
display_name: Il2rb and Il2rg are phosphorylated
species: Mus musculus
summary: Interleukin-2 receptor subunit beta (IL2RB, IL2Rβ) and Cytokine receptor
  common subunit gamma (IL2RG, IL2Rγ) is tyrosine phosphorylated after Interleukin-15
  (IL15) / IL15 receptor complex interaction (Adunyah et al. 1997, Zambricki et al.
  2005). More in detail, human and mouse IL15 have 70.2% amino acid sequence similarity
  and exhibit similar trans-presentation mechanism, signal transduction machinery
  and biological activities. Similarly, human IL15 shows cross-reactivity with mouse
  cells and it was demonstrated that human and mouse IL15 showed similar responses
  in mouse models (Stoklasek et al. 2006) (Patidar et al. data not published). This
  is a black box event because more evidence to support this reaction is needed.
