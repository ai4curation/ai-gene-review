stable_id: R-HSA-376122
display_name: DSCAM/DSCAML1 homodimerization
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DSCAM and DSCAML1 proteins are involved in homophilic intercellular interactions
  and these recognition events may play a role in neural connectivity. Recent studies
  in mouse demonstrate that DSCAM is selectively expressed in subclasses of cells
  and suggest that it uses homophilic repulsion to simultaneously promote both self
  avoidance (an essential developmental mechanism that allows axonal and dendrite
  processes to uniformly cover their synaptic fields) and tiling (ensures that the
  receptive fields of neurons from the same class do not overlap with one another)
  (Fuerst et al. 2008).

## Summary

DSCAM and DSCAML1 proteins are involved in homophilic intercellular interactions and these recognition events may play a role in neural connectivity. Recent studies in mouse demonstrate that DSCAM is selectively expressed in subclasses of cells and suggest that it uses homophilic repulsion to simultaneously promote both self avoidance (an essential developmental mechanism that allows axonal and dendrite processes to uniformly cover their synaptic fields) and tiling (ensures that the receptive fields of neurons from the same class do not overlap with one another) (Fuerst et al. 2008).
