stable_id: R-HSA-5607732
display_name: K63polyUb-TAK1 autophosphorylates
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) is a TAK1-interacting protein and induces TAK1
  (Transforming growth factor beta-associated kinase 1) kinase activity through promoting
  autophosphorylation of key serine/threonine sites of the kinase activation loop.
  There are four phosphorylation sites in the activation loop and analysis of these
  site mutants indicate that autophosphorylation of S192, is followed by sequential
  phosphorylation of T178, T187, and finally T184 (Scholz et al. 2010).
