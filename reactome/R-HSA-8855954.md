stable_id: R-HSA-8855954
display_name: B4GALNT2 transfers GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to Sial-Gal-GlcNAc-Gal to
  form the Sd(a) antigen on UMOD
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The histo-blood group antigen Sda was discovered to be a dominant character
  found in more than 90 % of Caucasian red blood cells. In addition to erythrocytes,
  the Sda antigen is also found in other tissues and body fluids, particularly in
  urine of humans and other mammals. The Sda antigen shares a common minimal saccharide
  structure (GalNAc-beta1-4[Neu5Ac-alpha2-3]Gal-beta-) with the Cad antigen. Both
  antigens contain a pentasaccharide structure, the Sda antigen's structure being
  GalNAc-beta1-4[Neu5Ac-alpha2-3]Gal-beta1-4GlcNAc-beta1-3Gal. The last step in the
  biosynthesis of both Sda and Cad antigens is catalysed by beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase
  2 (B4GALNT2), a Golgi membrane protein that transfers N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)
  from UDP-GalNAc to position C4 of the Gal residue of the Neu5Ac-alpha2-3Gal-beta1
  sequence (Montiel et al. 2003, Lo Presti et al. 2003, Dall'Olio et al. 2014). Both
  antigens can be expressed by N- or O-linked chains of glycoproteins. Tamm–Horsfall
  glycoprotein (THGP, aka UMOD) is a major carrier of the Sda antigen in urine (Soh
  et al. 1980, Serafini-Cessi & Conte 1982). After proteolytic cleavage, UMOD is secreted
  into the urine where it may play roles in colloid osmotic pressure, retarding passage
  of positively charged electrolytes, preventing urinary tract infection and modulateing
  formation of supersaturated salts and their crystals (Schmid et al. 2010).
