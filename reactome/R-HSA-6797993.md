stable_id: R-HSA-6797993
display_name: TP53 and CREBBP bind BNIP3L gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In hypoxic cells, TP53 (p53) binds p53 responsive elements in the BNIP3L
  gene. CREBBP (CBP) also localizes to the BNIP3L gene under hypoxic conditions, in
  vicinity to some of the p53 response elements, which is probably regulated by HIF1A
  (Fei et al. 2004).

## Summary

In hypoxic cells, TP53 (p53) binds p53 responsive elements in the BNIP3L gene. CREBBP (CBP) also localizes to the BNIP3L gene under hypoxic conditions, in vicinity to some of the p53 response elements, which is probably regulated by HIF1A (Fei et al. 2004).
