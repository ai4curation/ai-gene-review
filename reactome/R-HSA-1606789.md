display_name: ARSB hydrolyses DS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Arylsulfatase B (ARSB) hydrolyses sulfate from N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate
  units within dermatan sulfate (DS; Gorham & Cantz 1978). The conversion to 3-oxoalanine
  (formylglycine, FGly) of a cysteine residue in eukaryotes, is critical for catalytic
  activity, based on similarity to the prototypical arylsulfatase ARSA (Chruszcz et
  al. 2003, Lukatela et al. 1998). Defects in ARSB are the cause of mucopolysaccharidosis
  type VI (MPSVI) (MIM:253200, also called Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (Wicker et al.
  1991). ARSB activity is defective in multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) (MIM:272200)
  (Schmidt et al. 1995).
