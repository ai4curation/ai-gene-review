display_name: Oxidative damage to the AP site
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The APEX1-bound AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) 5'-deoxyribose phosphate at the
  single strand break (SSB) is susceptible to oxidative damage, and can be converted
  to tetrahydrofuran-like 1,2-dideoxyribose phosphate during base excision repair
  (BER) (Matsumoto et al. 1994, Klungland and Lindahl 1997).
