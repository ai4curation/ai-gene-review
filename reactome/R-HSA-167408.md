display_name: The high affinity receptor complex binds to G-protein
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The high affinity complex beta-endorphin:mu opioid receptor binds to the
  heterotrimeric G-protein. This binding stabilises a conformation of the G-protein
  alpha i subunit presenting a low affinity for GDP, but a high affinity for GTP
