display_name: ZFPM proteins bind GATA proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Friend of GATA (FOG) family of proteins are a highly-conserved family
  of large multitype zinc finger cofactors that bind to the amino zinc finger of GATA
  transcription factors, modulating their activity. GATA proteins are named for the
  DNA consensus sequence they recognize, (T/A)GATA(A/G). FOG/GATA protein interactions
  are essential for the development of many tissues. All six GATA family members are
  capable of interacting with both FOG-1 and FOG-2 (Tsang et al. 1997, Tevosian et
  al. 1999). Mutations that disrupt binding of GATA-1 to FOG-1 are associated with
  a syndrome of severe X-linked macrothrombocytopenia (Cantor & Orkin 2005) and in
  some cases dyserythropoietic anemia (Nichols et al. 2000). In addition to binding
  GAG proteins, FOGs interact with complexes containing the co-repressor C-terminal
  binding protein (CtBP) that are thought to coordinate histone modifications leading
  to a transcriptionally repressed state (Shi et al. 2003).

## Summary

The Friend of GATA (FOG) family of proteins are a highly-conserved family of large multitype zinc finger cofactors that bind to the amino zinc finger of GATA transcription factors, modulating their activity.
