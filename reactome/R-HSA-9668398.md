display_name: CHMP7 binds CHMP4B, which recruits other subunits of the ESCRT-III complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CHMP7 promotes the assembly of other ESCRT-III subunits at nuclear envelope
  fenestrations.  It first binds CHMP4B, which in turn causes recruitment and assembly
  of other ESCRTIII subunits including CHMP2A, CHMP4A, CHMP3 and IST1 (Olmos et al.
  2015, Vietri et al. 2015, Gu et al. 2017).
