species: Homo sapiens
summary: The human BTF2 basic transcription factor (also called TFIIH), is required
  for class1 gene transcription of the second round of transcripts. TFIIH has an adenosine
  triphosphate-dependent DNA helicase activity.  The helicase activity is closely
  associated with the multi-subunit BTF2/TFIIH transcription factor which also has
  a CTD protein kinase activity.
