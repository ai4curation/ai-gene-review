display_name: Fibronectin degradation by MMP1, 3, 7, 12, 13, 19, CTSS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MMP1 can degrade fibronectin (Fukai et al. 1995), as can MMP3 (Gunja-Smith
  et al. 1985, Nicholson et al. 1989, Wilhelm et al. 1993, Fukai et al. 1995),  MMP7
  (Quantin et al. 1989, Miyazaki et al. 1990, Fukai et al. 1995, von Bredow et al.
  1995), MMP10 (Nicholson et al. 1989), MMP12 (Gronski et al. 1997), MMP13 (Knauper
  et al. 1997), MMP14 (Shi & Sottile 2011) and 19 (Stracke et al. 2000). Cathepsin
  S is able to degrade fibronectin (Taleb et al. 2006). Studies have shown that fibronectin
  turnover is not prevented by protease inhibitors (Sottile & Hocking 2002) suggesting
  that caveolin-1-mediated endocytosis and intracellular degradation are involved
  (Salicioni et al. 2002, Sottile & Chandler 2004).
