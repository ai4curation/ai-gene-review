summary: 'Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with roles in processes including
  immune regulation, hematopoiesis, inflammation, oncogenesis, metabolic control and
  sleep.  It is the founding member of a family of IL-6-related cytokines such as
  IL-11, IL-27 leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cilliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)
  and oncostatin M. <br><br>The IL-6 receptor (IL6R) consists of an alpha subunit

  in transmembrane and soluble forms. The transmembrane form is mainly expressed by
  hepatocytes, neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and some lymphocytes. Soluble forms
  of IL6R (sIL6R) are also expressed by these cells. Two major mechanisms for the
  production of sIL6R have been proposed. Alternative splicing generates a transcript

  gp130 but not IL6R alpha, a process that is termed trans-signaling. This explains

  cells, smooth muscle cells, and embryonic stem cells, do not respond to IL6 alone,
