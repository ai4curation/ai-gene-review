stable_id: R-HSA-1031716
display_name: Expression of IFNG-stimulated genes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IFN-gamma stimulates gene expression of about 200 genes which include the
  primary response genes like IRFs, Fc-gamma receptor (FCGR), GBPs (guanylate-binding
  proteins) and also major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules,
  proteins involved in antigen presentation, antiviral proteins like PKR, OAS proteins
  etc. A wonderful list of most of the IFN-gamma inducible proteins with corresponding
  literature are mentioned in the review article and the supplementary document by
  Boehm et al 1997.
