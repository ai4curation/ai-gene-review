stable_id: R-HSA-5626220
display_name: C2CD3 binds the mother centriole
species: Homo sapiens
summary: C2 domain-containing protein 3 (C2CD3) is basal body-localized protein that
  is required for ciliogenesis and Hh signaling (Hoover et al, 2008; Balestra et al,
  2013).  C2CD3 is recruited to the centrosome in a pericentriolar material 1 protein
  (PCM1)- and microtubule-dependent manner and is required for the subsequent recruitment
  of the distal appendage proteins to the mother centriole (Tanos et al, 2013; Sillibourne
  et al, 2013; Ye et al, 2014; reviewed in Winey and O'Toole, 2014).  The distal appendage
  proteins are thought to be a component of the transition fibres that anchor the
  basal body to the membrane at the base of the cilium and are themselves required
  for the recruitment of Tau-tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) and for docking ciliary vesicles
  to the mother centriole (Tanos et al, 2013; Wei et al, 2013; Joo et al, 2013; Schmidt
  et al, 2012; Sillibourne et al, 2013; Burke et al, 2014).
