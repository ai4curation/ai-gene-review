species: Homo sapiens
summary: LDLR that engage PCSK9 at the cell membrane are internalized via the canonical
  clathrin-dependent endocytic machinery (Wang et al. 2012). This complex is routed
  to lysosomes via a pathway that does not require ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic
  tail of the receptor and does not involve the proteasomal or autophagy pathways.
  The clathrin is required for the internalization of the LDLR-PCSK9 complex that
  forms on the cell surface.

This complex is routed to lysosomes via a pathway that does not require ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor and does not involve the proteasomal or autophagy pathways.
