stable_id: R-RNO-9615712
display_name: Hspa8 binds Rnase1
species: Rattus norvegicus
summary: Intracellular proteins are targeted for proteolytic degradation in the lysosome
  with the aid of chaperones. Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) acts as the
  constitutive chaperone that binds Ribonuclease pancreatic beta-type (Rnase1) in
  the cytosol. Hspa8 recognizes a motif on Rnase1 based on the charge of amino acids
  (Chiang H et al. 1989). Once bound with Hspa8, the substrates are targeted to the
  lysosome or endosome.
