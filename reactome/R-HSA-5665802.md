display_name: SRGAP2 binds RAC1:GTP:FMNL1:profilin:G-actin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SRGAP2 binds FMNL1 activated by RAC1:GTP by simultaneously interacting with
  RAC1 and FMNL1. SRGAP2 co-localizes with RAC1, FMNL1, profilin and actin at the
  plasma membrane after RAC1-mediated activation of FMNL1 (Mason et al. 2011).
