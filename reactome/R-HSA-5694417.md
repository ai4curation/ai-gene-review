display_name: SEC16 complex binds SAR1B:GTP:SEC23:SEC24
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The multimeric SEC16 complex marks sites of ER exit (ERES) and helps to localize
  nascent COPII coat complexes through interaction with SEC23 and SAR1 (Battacharyya
  et al, 2007; Watson et al, 2006; Hughes et al, 2009; Yorimitsu and Sato, 2012; reviewed
  in Sprangers and Rabouille, 2015).  SEC16 may help to prevent premature dissociation
  of the COPII coats after activation of SEC13 GTPase (Supek et al, 2002; Kung et
  al, 2012).  SEC16 functions with hexameric TFG1, which is recruited to the ERES
  through direct interaction with SEC16 and is required for cargo traffic out of the
  ER and for organization of the ER-to-ERGIC boundary (Witte et al, 2001; Beetz et
  al, 2012; Johnson et al, 2015).
