stable_id: R-HSA-2468040
display_name: Cohesin binds PDS5 and WAPAL
species: Homo sapiens
summary: WAPAL (WAPL) and PDS5 proteins (PDS5A and/or PDS5B) are associated with cohesin
  throughout most of the cell cycle (Kueng et al. 2006, Gandhi et al. 2006). FGF motifs
  present in the N-terminal region of WAPAL participate in WAPAL binding to PDS5 and
  cohesin subunits RAD21, STAG1 (SA1) and STAG2 (SA2) (Shintomi and Hirano 2009).
