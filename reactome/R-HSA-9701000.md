display_name: BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimer autoubiquitinates
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In vivo, most BRCA1 and BARD1 polypeptides exist in the form of the BRCA1:BARD1
  heterodimer. Although BRCA1 and BARD1 each harbor a RING domain (Miki et al. 1994;
  Wu et al. 1996), only the RING domain of BRCA1 is known to associate functionally
  with E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (Brzovic et al. 2001). In vitro, BRCA1 alone
  exhibits a residual E3 ligase activity that is dramatically enhanced upon heterodimerization
  with BARD1 (Hashizume et al. 2001, Chen et al. 2002, Mallery et al. 2002, Wu-Baer
  et al. 2003, Xia et al. 2003). In addition to extensive auto-polyubiquitination
  on multiple unidentified lysine residues of both BRCA1 and BARD1, the heterodimer
  also mono- and/or poly-ubiquitinates a number of other substrates, including the
  H2A histones (Ohta et al. 2011, Kalb et al. 2014). Depending on the associated E2
  conjugase, BRCA1:BARD1 can generate polyubiquitin chains of various linkages, including
  K6-linked ubiquitin polymers, that are not typically involved in proteasomal degradation
  (Wu-Baer et al. 2003, Nishikawa et al. 2004, Christensen et al. 2007). Autoubiquitination
  has been reported to increase the enzymatic activity of the BRCA1:BARD1 complex
  and may promote DNA damage response signaling (Mallery et al. 2002). In contrast,
  its E3 ligase activity can be suppressed by association with regulatory factors
  such as the BAP1 ubiquitin hydrolase (Nishikawa et al. 2009) or the UBXN1 ubiquitin-binding
  protein (Wu-Baer et al. 2010). The cancer-predisposing BRCA1 missense mutation C61G
  prevents binding to BARD1 and thereby impairs the ubiquitin ligase activity of BRCA1
  (Wu et al. 1996, Ransburgh et al. 2010, Brzovic et al. 2001, Mallery et al. 2002,
  Wu-Baer et al. 2003). Studies in mouse cells have shown that the ubiquitin ligase
  activity of BRCA1 is not essential for its role in tumor suppression (Shakya et
  al. 2011) or double-strand DNA break repair by homologous recombination.
