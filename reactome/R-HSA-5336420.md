display_name: DT fragment B transports DT fragment A from target cell endosome membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The normal process of acidification of the endocytic vesicle containing diphtheria
  toxin (DT A:B) associated with target cell proteins HBEGF and CD9 is thought to
  cause a conformational change in the toxin. Its B fragment forms a channel in the
  endocytic vesicle membrane through which the A fragment is extruded into the target
  cell cytosol. There, reduction of the disulfide bond connecting the A and B fragments
  releases the A fragment to refold. The process requires participation of target
  cell heat shock proteins (HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1),
  which may mediate disulfide bond cleavage (Ratts et al. 2003; Murphy 2011).
