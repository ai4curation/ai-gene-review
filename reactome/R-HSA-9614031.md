summary: 'L-type calcium channels are responsible for the excitation-contraction coupling
  of skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscles and for aldosterone secretion in endocrine
  cells of the adrenal cortex. Class IV agents are L-type calcium channel blockers
  used in the treatment of hypertension. In cardiac muscle, they decrease conduction
  through the AV node, and shorten phase 2 (the plateau) of the cardiac action potential.
  There are three main chemical classes of class IV agents: Dihydropyridines (prototype
  nifedipine), phenylalkylamines (prototype verapamil) and benzothiazepines (prototype
  diltiazem). Despite their different structures, they all bind within a single overlapping
  drug binding region close to the pore and to the proposed activation gate of the
  channel’s α1 subunit (Striessnig et al. 2015). Dihydropyridines (nifedipine, amlodipine,
  cilnidipine, clevidipine, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine,
  nitrendipine) all block Ca2+-channels and are usually the first-line therapy in

  producing marked vasodilation. It has an intrinsically long duration of action (Murdoch

  N-type Ca2+ channels. It is used in the treatment of mild to moderate essential
  hypertension (Lohn et al. 2002, Minami et al. 2000). Clevidipine is a short-acting
  Ca2+-blocking agent given intravenously which is highly selective for vascular,
  as opposed to myocardial smooth muscle and, therefore, has little or no effect on
  myocardial contractility or cardiac conduction. It reduces mean arterial blood pressure
  by decreasing systemic vascular resistance (Prlesi & Cheng-Lai 2009). Felodipine
