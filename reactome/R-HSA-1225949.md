summary: 'CBL binds to phosphorylated tyrosine Y1069 (i.e. Y1045 in the mature protein)
  residue of EGFR cancer mutants. Phosphorylation of Y1045 (corresponding to Y1069
  when counting from the first amino acid of the EGFR precursor, prior to cleavage
  of the 24-amino acid signal peptide at the N-terminus) has been directly demonstrated
  in the following EGFR cancer mutants: EGFR L858R mutant (Greulich et al. 2005, Choi
  et al. 2007); EGFR G719S mutant (Sordella et al. 2004, Greulich et al. 1005, Choi
  et al. 2007); EGFR L747_P753delinsS mutant (Sordella et al. 2004, Choi et al. 2007);
  EGFR L747_A750delinsP mutant (Greulich et al. 2005); EGFR L861Q mutant (Choi et
  al. 2007); EGFR A289V mutant (Lee et al. 2006); EGFR G598V mutant (Lee et al. 2006);
  EGFR R108K mutant (Lee et al. 2006); EGFR D770_N771insNPG mutant (Greulich et al.
  2005; Xu et al. 2007); EGFR K739_I744dup mutant (Xu et al. 2007); EGFR A767_V769dup
  mutant (Xu et al. 2007). Very little if any phosphorylation of Y1045 was shown in
  EGFR T263P mutant (Lee et al. 2006) and EGFR N771_H773dup mutant (Xu et al. 2007).
  Direct binding of CBL was demonstrated for the EGFR L858R mutant (Yang et al. 2006,
  Padron et al. 2007) and EGFR E746_A750del mutant (Padron et al. 2007).  In EGFRvIII
  mutant, Y1045 (Y1069) is not phosphorylated (Han et al. 2006, Grandal et al. 2007).
  Han et al. detected no CBL binding to EGFRvIII mutant (Han et al. 2006), while Grandal
  et al. detected very little binding, which they explained by indirect recruitment
  of CBL to EGFRvIII through GRB2 (Grandal et al. 2007).'

## Summary

CBL binds to phosphorylated tyrosine Y1069 (i.e. Y1045 in the mature protein) residue of EGFR cancer mutants. Phosphorylation of Y1045 (corresponding to Y1069 when counting from the first amino acid of the EGFR precursor, prior to cleavage of the 24-amino acid signal peptide at the N-terminus) has been directly demonstrated in the following EGFR cancer mutants: EGFR L858R mutant (Greulich et al. 2005, Choi et al. 2007); EGFR G719S mutant (Sordella et al. 2004, Greulich et al. 1005, Choi et al. 2007); EGFR L747_P753delinsS mutant (Sordella et al. 2004, Choi et al. 2007); EGFR L747_A750delinsP mutant (Greulich et al. 2005); EGFR L861Q mutant (Choi et al. 2007); EGFR A289V mutant (Lee et al. 2006); EGFR G598V mutant (Lee et al. 2006); EGFR R108K mutant (Lee et al. 2006); EGFR D770_N771insNPG mutant (Greulich et al. 2005; Xu et al. 2007); EGFR K739_I744dup mutant (Xu et al. 2007); EGFR A767_V769dup mutant (Xu et al. 2007). Very little if any phosphorylation of Y1045 was shown in EGFR T263P mutant (Lee et al. 2006) and EGFR N771_H773dup mutant (Xu et al. 2007).

In EGFRvIII mutant, Y1045 (Y1069) is not phosphorylated (Han et al. 2006, Grandal et al. 2007).
