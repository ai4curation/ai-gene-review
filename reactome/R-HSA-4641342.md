stable_id: R-HSA-4641342
display_name: SUMOylation of TOP2A with SUMO1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TOP2A is SUMOylated with SUMO1 (Mao et al. 2000, Dawlaty et al. 2008, Matafora
  et al. 2009, Impens et al. 2014). SUMOylation is observed in response to TOP2A-mediated
  DNA damage induced by teniposide.
