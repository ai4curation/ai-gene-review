stable_id: R-HSA-193700
display_name: p75NTR ICD signals to NF-kB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The p75NTR ICD has the potential to bind many intracellular proteins, including
  TRAF6, SC1, NADE, NRAGE, and RHOA. It may bring these proteins to function in different
  cellular compartments. p75NTR ICD was shown to activate NF-kB via TRAF6.
