display_name: IFNGR1:JAK1:INFGR2:JAK2 binds JAK1,2 inhibitors
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) binds and is inhibited by several small molecule drugs
  (Clark et al. 2014, Fridman et al. 2010, Hanan et al. 2012). The Janus kinases (JAKs)
  are a family of intracellular tyrosine kinases that play an essential role in the
  signaling of numerous cytokines that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
  inflammatory diseases. Drugs that inhibit these kinases such as baricitinib, tofacitinib
  and ruxolitinib are thus plausible candidates for treatment of severe host inflammatory
  reactions to viral infection (Peterson et al. 2020, Richardson et al. 2020).
