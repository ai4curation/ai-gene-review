species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Immunophilin p23 (also known as PTGES3) binds selectively to the ATP-bound
  state of HSP90. p23 stabilizes the closed state of HSP90, which weakens the binding
  of STIP1(HOP) and promotes its exit from the complex (McLaughlin H et al. 2006;
  Karagöz GE et al. 2011). When FKBP51 (FKBP5) is present, a stable intermediate FKBP51:GR:HSP90:p23
  is formed by expulsion of HSP70 and STIP1(HOP) (Ebong I et al. 2016). '

## Summary

Immunophilin p23 (also known as PTGES3) binds selectively to the ATP-bound state of HSP90. p23 stabilizes the closed state of HSP90, which weakens the binding of STIP1(HOP) and promotes its exit from the complex (McLaughlin H et al. 2006; Karagöz GE et al. 2011). When FKBP51 (FKBP5) is present, a stable intermediate FKBP51:GR:HSP90:p23 is formed by expulsion of HSP70 and STIP1(HOP) (Ebong I et al. 2016).
