stable_id: R-HSA-166072
display_name: MyD88 forms a complex with TIRAP:activated TLR2/4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MyD88 binds to IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) and the receptor heterocomplex
  (the signaling complex) and thereby mediates the association of IRAK with the receptor.  MyD88
  therefore couples a serine/threonine protein kinase to the receptor complex.
