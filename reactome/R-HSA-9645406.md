display_name: ALPK1:ADP-heptose:p-T9-TIFA oligomer:K63pUb-TRAF6 oligomer recruits
  MAP3K7 (TAK1)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2) and/or TAB3, as part of a complex that also
  contains TAK1 (MAP3K7) and TAB1, binds polyubiquitinated TRAF6. The TAB2 and TAB3
  regulatory subunits of the TAK1 complex contain C-terminal Npl4 zinc finger (NZF)
  motifs that recognize Lys63-pUb chains (Kanayama et al. 2004). The recognition mechanism
  is specific for Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains (Kulathu Y et al 2009). TAK1 can be
  activated by unattached Lys63-polyubiquitinated chains when TRAF6 has no detectable
  polyubiquitination (Xia et al. 2009) and thus the synthesis of these chains by TRAF6
  may be the signal transduction mechanism. This binding leads to autophosphorylation
  and activation of TAK1.
