display_name: PI3K bound to phosphorylated heterodimers of ERBB2 ECD mutants and EGFR
  converts PIP2 to PIP3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ERBB2 G309E and ERBB2 S310F activate PI3K/AKT signaling, demonstrated by
  activating phosphorylation of AKT1 (Greulich et al. 2012).  It is assumed that phosphorylated
  heterodimers of ERBB2 ECD mutants and EGFR, like the wild type heterodimers of ERBB2
  and EGFR, can bind to the GRB2:GAB1 complex, leading to recruitment of the PI3K
  complex, which results in conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 and activation of the AKT signaling.
