display_name: CD28 homodimer binds B7-2 monomer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CD28 delivers the costimulatory signal by interacting with its ligand B7-2
  on the antigen-presenting cell and modulates T cell antigen recognition. The V-like
  domains of CD28 contains a strictly conserved MYPPPY sequence motif that maps to
  the CDR3-analogous loop and is critical for recognition of its ligand B7-2. Engagement
  of CD28 with B7-1 and with B7-2 have different bilogical functions in-vivo. Rapid
  dissociation of B7-2 from CD28 may not permit the robust tyrosine phosphorylation
  that the prolonged binding of B7-1 induces (Linsley et al. 1994). <br>CTLA4 primarily
  affects CD28 costimulation by acting as a competitive inhibitor. CTLA-4 has a much
  higher affinity for these ligands compared to CD28. When CTLA-4 binds to B7-1 or
  B7-2, it prevents these ligands from interacting with CD28, thereby reducing the
  costimulatory signals that are crucial for T cell activation (van der Merwe et al.
  1997).
