summary: 'During RNA transcription, ZFC3H1 binds the first exon and first intron of

  to the polyadenylate tail of the RNA, thus PAXT is targeted to capped, polyadenylated
  RNAs (Meola et al. 2016). ZFC3H1 of PAXT and ZC3H18 associated with the NEXT complex

  PAPOLG (PAPgamma) interacts with ZFC3H1 of the PAXT connection and appears to participate

  composition of the larger PAXT complex resembles the MTREC complex of yeast (Contreras

## Summary

During RNA transcription, ZFC3H1 binds the first exon and first intron of nascent RNAs (Fan et al. 2024). On short RNAs with few exons (Fan et al. 2024) ZFC3H1 then binds MTREX (MTR4, SKIV2L2), forming the PAXT connection: ZFC3H1:MTREX (Meola et al. 2016, Fan et al. 2024).
