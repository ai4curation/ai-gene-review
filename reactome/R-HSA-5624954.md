display_name: INPP5E translocates to the primary cilium
species: Homo sapiens
summary: INPP5E is a ciliary peripheral membrane protein that is associated with the
  ciliopathy Joubert's Syndrome (Bielas et al, 2009; Jacoby et al, 2009). Ciliary
  localization of the full-length protein depends on a targeting sequence and interactions
  with PDE6D and ARL13B, although the detailed mechanism remains unresolved (Humbert
  et al, 2012).
