display_name: p-S195-CD274 binds ERAD complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon phosphorylation by AMPK, PD-L1 (CD274) is abnormally glycosylated due
  to abnormal mannose trimming and is tagged for ER-associated protein degradation
  (ERAD- mediated clearance. AMPK phosphorylated PD-L1 binds to the ERAD complex and
  is tagged for ubiquitination/degradation (Cha et al., 2018, Dai et al, 2021).
