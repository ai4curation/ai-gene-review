species: Homo sapiens
summary: CBL-CIN85-Endophilin complex mediates ligand-induced down-regulation of the
  EGF receptor. The BAR domain of endophilin induces membrane curvature. The three
  SH3 domains of CIN85 bind to atypical proline-arginine motifs (PxxxPR) present in
  the carboxyl termini of CBL and CBL-b. In this way, CIN85 clusters CBL molecules,
  which is crucial for efficient EGFR endocytosis and degradation (Soubeyran et al.
  2002).
