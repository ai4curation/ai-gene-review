stable_id: R-HSA-6799431
display_name: TP53 binds HIPK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TP53 (p53) forms a complex with a protein kinase HIPK1 (Kondo et al. 2003,
  Rey et al. 2013). HIPK1 may phosphorylate TP53 on an unidentified serine residue
  (Kondo et al. 2003). Binding to HIPK1 has been implicated in the negative regulation
  of TP53 activity (Kondo et al. 2003), but HIPK1 overexpression has also been implicated
  in the positive regulation of TP53 activity (Rey et al. 2013).
