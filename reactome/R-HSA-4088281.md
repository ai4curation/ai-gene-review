display_name: Endorepellin binds KDR (VEGFR2)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Endorepellin is the C-terminal domain V of perlecan, constituting amino acids
  3687–4391 (Mongiat et al. 2004). It has anti-angiogenic properties, blocking endothelial
  cell adhesion to fibronectin and type I collagen (Mongiat et al. 2003). Endorepellin
  and a smaller fragement constituting the third laminin G–like (LG) domain (LG3)
  disrupt actin stress fibers and focal adhesions via an interaction with the collagen
  receptor alpha2beta1 integrin (Bix et al. 2004). The first and second laminin G
  domains 1 of endorepellin bind specifically and with high affinity to Ig domains
  3–5 of VEGFR2 (Willis et al. 2013).
