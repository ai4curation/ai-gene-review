display_name: Defective HYAL1 does not hydrolyse Chondroitin chains
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Hyaluronidase 1 (HYAL1) hydrolyses 1-4 linkages between GalNAc and D-glucuronate
  residues in chondroitin (or dermatan). It also hydrolyses this linkage in hyaluronate,
  another glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composed of repeating disaccharide units but the
  only one which is non-sulfated. Defects in HYAL1 (MIM:607071) cause mucopolysaccharidosis
  type IX (MPS IX, Natowicz syndrome, Hyaluronidase deficiency, MIM:601492), a rare
  lysosomal storage disease. Triggs-Raine et al. identified a patient with two mutations
  in HYAL1 alleles, a nonconservative amino acid substitution (Glu268Lys) and a complex
  intragenic rearrangement (1361del37ins14) that results in a premature termination
  codon (Triggs-Raine et al. 1999).
