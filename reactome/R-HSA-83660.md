summary: The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α exerts its biological
  activity through the membrane bound (tmTNF-α) or soluble (sTNF-α) forms. Both sTNF-α
  and tmTNF-α ligands interact with either TNFR1 (p55, CD120a) or TNFR2 (p75, CD120b)
  on a variety of immune and nonimmune cell types. <p>Transmembrane TNF-α functions
  as a bipolar molecule that can transmit signals both as a ligand and as a receptor
  in a cell-to-cell contact fashion (Eissner G et al. 2004; Zhang H et al. 2008; Juhász
  K et al. 2013). As a ligand tmTNF-α binds to receptors TNFR1 or -R2 on TNF-responsive
  cells to initiate signaling pathways that lead among other things to cell death
  or NFkB-mediated expression of inflammatory genes. Binding of tmTNF-α by TNFRs can
  simultaneously induce a reverse signals transmiting back to the tmTNF-bearing cell.
  The molecular basis of TNF reverse signaling remains largely unexplored.
