species: Homo sapiens
summary: Dermatan sulfate (DS) is thought to be hydrolysed from its dermatan sulfate
  proteoglycan (DSPG) by an unknown human beta-xylosidase. The reaction shown here
  is based on studies of a rabbit lysosomal enzyme fraction assay (Takagaki et al.
  1988). DSPG can have many DS chains attached to it; this example shows the hydrolysis
  of one DS chain from DSPG.
