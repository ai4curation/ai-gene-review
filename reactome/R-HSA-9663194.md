display_name: Some pathogenic BRCA1 mutants do not bind BARD1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The heterodimerization of BRCA1 and BARD1 is mediated by sequences encompassing
  the N-terminal RING domains of both proteins (Wu et al. 1996, Brzovic, Rajagopal
  et al. 2001, Brzovic, Meza et al. 2001, Morris et al. 2002). Cancer-predisposing
  mutations in the RING domain of BRCA1 frequently disrupt the formation of the BRCA1:BARD1
  complex.<br><br>The following BRCA1 mutants identified in cancer patients or in
