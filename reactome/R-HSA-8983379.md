display_name: p-Y-STAT3:p-STAT5 translocates to the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 5A/5B (STAT5A and STAT5B respectively or STAT5) dimers
  translocate from the cytosol to the nucleoplasm. 10 ng/mL Interleukin-15 (IL15)
  induces the nuclear localization of phosphorylated STAT3, unless inhibited by neutralizing
  anti-IL15 or anti-Interleukin receptor alpha subunit (IL15RA, IL15Rα) mAbs (Giron
  Michel et al.2003, Johnston et al. 1995).This is a black box event because nuclear
  translocation of phosphorylated STAT3:STAT5 dimers has not been demonstrated but
  is inferred from other Jak-Stat signaling events.
