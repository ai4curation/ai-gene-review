stable_id: R-HSA-6781922
display_name: USP13 binds UFD1L:SKP2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the nucleus USP13 binds UFD1 which acts as a scaffold connecting USP13
  to SKP2. USP13 mediates the deubiquitination of SKP2, thereby regulating endoplasmic
  reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) by counteracting APC/C(Cdh1)-mediated SKP2
  ubiquitination (Chen et al. 2011).
