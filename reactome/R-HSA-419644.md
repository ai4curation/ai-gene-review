stable_id: R-HSA-419644
display_name: Transphosphorylation of pLIMK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Binding of Hsp90 to the LIMK proteins protects them from degradation and
  promotes their dimer formation and transphosphorylation. It is estimated that LIMK1
  contains at least 5 phospho-amino acids primarily phospho-serines, in its kinase
  domain. The positions of these serine residues are not known. Transphosphorylation
  of these serine residues in LIMK1 increases its stability.
