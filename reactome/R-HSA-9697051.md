display_name: RTC binds NRTIs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, comprising a backbone of two nucleos(t)ide
  reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus another ARV, has helped extend life
  expectancy in people living with HIV (Orkin et al. 2018). NRTIs work by inhibiting
  HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), preventing transcription of HIV RNA to DNA. Emtricitabine,
  a cytidine analogue (Feng et al. 2009, Al-Majed  et al. 2020) and tenofovir, an
  acyclic nucleotide diester analogue of adenosine monophosphate  (McConville et al.
  2015, Ray et al. 2016) are compounds which inhibit RT causing chain termination
  and inhibition of viral protein synthesis.
