summary: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is a RING
  domain Ub ligase (E3), which, in conjunction with Ubc13-Uev1A, catalyzes K63-linked
  polyubiquitination that is required for activation of transforming growth factor
  β-activated kinase (TAK1 or MAP3K7) and IκB kinase (IKK). TRAF6 is activated downstream
  of alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1) by binding to TRAF-interacting protein with FHA
  domain (TIFA) (Milivojevic M et al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018). TIFA recruits TRAF6
  via a consensus TRAF6-binding motif of TIFA. Glycerol-gradient ultracentrifugation
  showed that only the high-molecular-weight forms of TIFA co-sedimented with TRAF6,
  suggesting that oligomerization of TIFA greatly enhanced its ability to bind to
  TRAF6 (Ea CK et al. 2004). In vitro ubiquitination assay in the presence of E1,
  Ubc13-Uev1A, purified endogenous TRAF6, Ub, and ATP showed that TIFA enhanced the
  Ub ligase activity of TRAF6 (Ea CK et al. 2004). Incubation of TRAF6 with wild-type
  or mutant TIFA proteins followed by gel-filtration chromatography showed that TIFA
  protein led to oligomerization of TRAF6, which eluted from the gel filtration column
  in the void volume (>700 kDa) (Ea CK et al. 2004). Importantly, these high-molecular-weight
  forms of TRAF6 displayed greatly increased Ub ligase activity as compared with TRAF6
  of lower-molecular-weight species, despite a similar amount of TRAF6 protein in
  these fractions. Moreover, only the fraction with significantly higher Ub ligase
  activity of TRAF6 was able to activate IKK (Ea CK et al. 2004). The TIFA mutant
  that did not bind to TRAF6 was also unable to induce TRAF6 oligomerization (Ea CK
  et al. 2004). Cell fractionation and immunoblot analysis also suggest that TRAF6
  forms oligomers in a TIFA-dependent manner in HEK293T cells in response to Shigella
  flexneri infection (Gaudet RG et al. 2017). Thus, upon bacterial infection such
  as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium or Neisseria
  meningitidis ALPK1 kinase activity induces TIFA oligomerization (Milivojevic M et
  al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018). The oligomerized forms of TIFA bind to TRAF6 and
  promote TRAF6 oligomerization (Ea CK et al. 2004). As a result, the TRAF6 Ub-ligase
  is activated to catalyze K63-linked polyubiquitination in conjunction with the Ubc13-Uev1A
  E2 complex (Ea CK et al. 2004). Activated TRAF6 promotes polyubiquitin-mediated
  activation the protein kinase TAK1 (MAP3K7) complex (Ea CK et al. 2004). Activated
  TAK1 (MAP3K7) in turn phosphorylates IkB kinase (IKK) at key serine residues within
  the activation loop, thereby activating IKK complex (Israël A 2010).
