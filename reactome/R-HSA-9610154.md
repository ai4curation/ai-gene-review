display_name: Dissociation of phosphorylated MAP2Ks and MAPKs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The mechanisms governing dissocation of activated signaling complexes downstream
  of NGF and RAP1 stimulation are not fully worked out, however phosphorylated MAPK
  dimers are known to phosphorylate cytosolic and nuclear targets that promote neuronal
  gene expression and differentiation (Nguyen et al, 1993; reviewed in Vaudry et al,
  2002; Santiago and Bashaw, 2014).
