display_name: HS-GAGs translocate to the lysosome for degradation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: As part of the natural turnover of GAGs, extracellular HSPGs are endocytosed
  to the lysosome to be degraded (Winchester 2005). Studies of cultured cells suggest
  that heparanase-2 HPSE2 may block targeting of HPSE and HS-proteoglycan to lysosomes
  (Levy-Adam et al. 2010).

## Summary

As part of the natural turnover of GAGs, extracellular HSPGs are endocytosed to the lysosome to be degraded (Winchester 2005). Studies of cultured cells suggest that heparanase-2 HPSE2 may block targeting of HPSE and HS-proteoglycan to lysosomes (Levy-Adam et al. 2010).
