display_name: CTF1 binds LIFR:JAKs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cardiotrophin-1 (CTF1/CT-1) is a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines which
  was originally discovered as a factor which can induce hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes
  both in vitro and in vivo (Pennica et al. 1995a). Subsequently, CTF1 has been shown
  to have a wide variety of different effects on cardiac and non cardiac cells including
  the ability to stimulate the survival of both cardiac and neuronal cells (Latchman
  1999). Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), CTF1, and oncostatin M (OSM) are four helix
  bundle cytokines acting through a common heterodimeric receptor composed of gp130
  and LIF receptor (LIFR) (Pennica et al. 1995b).
