display_name: Phosphorylation of Cdc25C at Ser216 by CHEK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cdc25C is negatively regulated  by phosphorylation on Ser 216, the 14-3-3-binding
  site. This is an important regulatory mechanism used by cells to block mitotic entry
  under normal conditions and after DNA damage (Chaturvedi et al, 1999; Bulavin et
  al., 2003).
