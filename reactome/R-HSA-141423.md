display_name: Binding of the MCC complex to the APC/C complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the direct inhibition model, association of the MCC with APCC results
  in the inactivation of APC/C. However, the affinity between MCC and APC/C is not
  high, so that the inhibition is readily reversible. The role of unattached kinetochores
  is to sensitize the APC/C to prolonged inhibition by the MCC.

## Summary

In the direct inhibition model, association of the MCC with APCC results in the inactivation of APC/C. However, the affinity between MCC and APC/C is not high, so that the inhibition is readily reversible. The role of unattached kinetochores is to sensitize the APC/C to prolonged inhibition by the MCC.
