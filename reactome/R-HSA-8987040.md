species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interferon lambda receptor 1 receptor (IFNLR1, IL28RA) is believed to be
  phosphorylated  by the Interferon lambda-1 (IFNL1 or IL29) complex (Sheppard et
  al. 2003). This complex is formed by IFNL1, IFNLR1, which is associated with phosphorylated
  Tyrosine protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and Interleukin 10 receptor beta (IL10RB), which
  is associated with phosphorylated Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase TYK2 (TYK2).
  IFNL1 induced Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) tyrosine
  phosphorylation but not that of other STATs is at least partly mediated by IFNLR1
  tyrosines 343 and 517 (Dumoutier et al. 2004). This is a black box event because
  there is not enough evidence to associate specific tyrosines with the binding of
  STATs and because the phosphorylation of these tyrosines is inferred from the STAT
  signaling mechanisms of related receptors.
