display_name: PSMG1:PSMG2 dimer binds the 20S core particle outer ring
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The PSMG1:PSMG2 heterodimer is a proteasome chaperone that associates with
  the outer ring of the 20S core particle (20S CP) precursors but not with the mature
  20S CP, suggesting that it is released upon maturation of the catalytic active sites
  (Hirano et al. 2006, reviewed in Tomko and Nochstrasser 2013). Based on cryogenic
  electron microscopy (cryo-EM), PSMG1:PSMG2 binds the opposite side of the outer
  ring from the PSMG3:PSMG4 dimer (Adolf et al. 2024). The knockdown of PSGM3 chaperone,
  needed for the formation of the outer ring, results in accumulation of unbound PSMG1:PSMG2
  dimers, implying that PSMG1:PSMG2 dimer binds to pre-formed outer rings (Hirano
  et al. 2006). The knockdown of PSMG1 and PSMG2 in human embryonic kidney cell line
  HEK293 leads to accumulation of outer ring dimers, but no inner (beta) rings, suggesting
  that the PSMG1:PSMG2 dimer functions to prevent the formation of outer ring dimers
  that might  stall proper proteasome biogenesis (Hirano et al. 2006, reviewed in
  Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). By cryo-EM, PSMG1:PSMG2 contacts all the alpha (PSMA)
  subuits of the outer ring except alpha-3 (PSMA4), directly binding N-termini from
  multiple PSMAs (Adolf et al. 2024).
