display_name: Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by activated mTORC1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Raptor recruits mTOR to non-phosphorylated 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E and positively
  modulates phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTOR. 4E-BP1 is further phosphorylated on
  multiple sites by other unknown kinases, also contributing to the dissociation of
  4E-BP1 from eIF4E. Thus mTORC1 relieves the inhibitory effect of 4E-BP1 on eIF4E
  dependent translation initiation (Inoki et al. 2005, Gingras et al. 1999, 2001).
