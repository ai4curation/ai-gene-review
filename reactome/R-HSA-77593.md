summary: The nuclear poly(A) binding protein (PABPN1), which binds the growing poly(A)
  tails once it has reached a length of about ten nucleotides. Stimulation of poly(A)
  polymerase by both CPSF and PABPN1 is synergistic and results in processive elongation
  of the RNA (the polymerase adds AMP residues without dissociating from the RNA).
  The processive reaction is terminated when the tail has reached a length of about
  250 nucleotides.

## Summary

Stimulation of poly(A) polymerase by both CPSF and PABPN1 is synergistic and results in processive elongation of the RNA (the polymerase adds AMP residues without dissociating from the RNA).
