display_name: Transport of antigen loaded MHC II molecules to surface
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once MHC class II-peptide complexes are formed, they must be transported
  back to the cell surface. It is unclear how this occurs. LEs/lysosomes with peptide
  loaded MHC II molecules may move in a bidirectional manner in a stop-and-go fashion
  along microtubules to the plasma membrane, driven by the activities of the oppositely-directed
  motor proteins dynein and kinesin (Wubbolts et al. 1996, 1999, Chow et al. 2002,
  Rocha & Neefjes 2007). Ultimately, LEs/lysosomes fuse to the plasma membrane delivering
  the MHC II-peptide complexes to the surface (Raposo et al. 1996, Rocha & Neefjes
  2007). RAB7-GTP present on LEs/lysosome membrane interacts with Rab7-interacting
  lysosomal protein (RILP) and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1L (ORP1L)
  to form a tripartite RILP-Rab7-ORP1L complex. RILP binds to the p150 dynactin subunit
  to recruit the dynein or kinesin motor proteins. ORP1L recruits this complex to
  betaIII spectrin domains, which appears to be critical for dynein motor activation
  and transport of LEs/lysosome vesicles to the cell periphery (Johansson et al. 2007,
  Rocha & Neefjes 2008).
