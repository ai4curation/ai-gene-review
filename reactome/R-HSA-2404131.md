summary: When the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is missing, saturated or
  inhibited, chylomicron remnants (CRs) containing all-trans-retinyl esters (atREs)
  can be cleared from circulation by  interaction with cell-surface heparan sulfate
  proteoglycan (HSPG) and secreted apolipoprotein E (apoE). This complex is then presented
  to LDL receptor-related proteins (LRPs; reviews May et al. 2007, Li et al. 2001,
  Hussain 2001) for internalization (Ji et al. 1993).
