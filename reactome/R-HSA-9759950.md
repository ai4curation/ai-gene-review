## Summary

Based on the luciferase reporter assay, microRNA miR-200c-3p binds to the 3'UTR of CDH11 mRNA, which results in decreased levels of CDH11 mRNA. Upregulation of miR-200C-3p is associated with CDH11 mRNA downregulation in colonic epithelial cells, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (Van der Goten et al. 2014). Downregulation of miR-200c-3p has been reported in invasive breast cancer cell lines where it is associated with upregulation of CDH11 mRNA (Luo et al. 2013).<br><br>As the 3'UTR is identical in the two human CDH11 splicing isoforms, both mRNA isoforms are shown as targets of miR-200c-3p, with the short variant annotated as a set candidate.
