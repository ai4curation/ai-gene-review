stable_id: R-HSA-202466
display_name: Interaction of Bcl10 to CARMA1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Bcl10 is recruited to activated, oligomeric CARMA1 through a CARD-CARD interaction.
  Bcl10 is characterized by an N-terminal CARD motif and a C-terminal extension of
  ~130 amino acids rich in serine and threonine residues that serve as targets for
  multiple phosphorylation events.
