display_name: Dissociation of phosphorylated PLC-gamma 1 from p-EGFRvIII mutant
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once phosphorylated, PLC-gamma 1 is expected to dissociate from phosphorylated
  EGFRvIII cancer mutant and induce downstream signaling in the same way it does when
  activated by the wild-type EGFR. However, except for the phosphorylation of PLCG1
  binding site in EGFRvIII (Grandal et al. 2007), other events involved in activation
  of PLCG1 signaling have not been studied in cells expressing EGFRvIII.
