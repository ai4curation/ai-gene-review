display_name: PM20D1 transforms oleoyl-phe from oleate and phe
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Extracellular PM20D1 (N-fatty-acyl-amino acid synthase/hydrolase PM20D1)
  catalyzes the reversible condensation of L-phenylalanine (L-phe) and oleate ((9Z)-octadecenoate)
  to form oleoyl-phe (N-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-L-phenylalanine) and water. In addition
  to the condensation of phe with oleate ((9Z)-octadecenoate) annotated here, purified
  human PM20D1 protein in vitro can catalyze the condensation of leucine and isoleucine
  with oleate and other long-chain unsaturated fatty acids including arachidonate,
  with lower efficiencies. Although the reverse (hydrolysis) direction of this reaction
  is thermodynamically favored, expression of PM20D1 protein in mice or in cultured
  cells was associated with elevated levels of oleoyl-phe in serum and culture media,
  respectively. Treatment of cultured mouse brown adipose tissue adipocytes with oleoyl-phe
  induced uncoupled respiration independently of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) and consistent
  with this observation, expression of PM20D1 and elevated blood levels of oleoyl-phe
  in mice were associated with increased energy expenditure and improved glucose homeostasis.
  These results suggest a physiological role for PM20D1 and its condensation reaction
  product in thermogenesis and raise the possibility that oleoyl-phe and related molecules
  might have a clinical role in treatment of obesity (Long et al. 2016).
