stable_id: R-HSA-5632914
display_name: TP53 binds the GLS2 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The mitochondrial glutaminase GLS2 gene possesses two putative p53-binding
  sites in its promoter and one putative p53 binding site in the first intron. TP53
  was demonstrated to bind to p53-response elements in the promoter but not intron
  1 of GLS2 (Hu et al. 2010, Suzuki et al. 2010).
