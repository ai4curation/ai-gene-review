summary: TNF-α ligation to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) induces the formation of the TNFR1
  signaling complex composed of TNFR1, TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain), TRAF2
  (TNF receptor associated factor-2), RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serin/threonine
  protein kinase 1), and E3 ubiquitin ligases BIRC2, BIRC3 (cIAP1/2, cellular inhibitor
  of apoptosis) and LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex) (Micheau O and
  Tschopp J 2003). The conjugation of K63-linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains by BIRC2/3
  to RIPK1 allows further recruitment and activation of the TAK1 (also known as MAP3K7)
  complex and IκB kinase (IKK) complex which in turn drives activation of NF-kappa-B
  (Ea CK et al. 2006; Haas et al. 2009). The catalytic activity of LUBAC, composed
  of HOIL-1L, HOIP, and SHARPIN, specifically generates the N-terminal methionine-linked
  ubiquitin (Met1-Ub) chains (also known as linear Ub chains) (Kirisako T et al. 2006;
  Walczak H et al. 2012; Rittinger K & Ikeda F 2017; Fuseya Y & Iwai K 2021). UBE2L3
  functions as E2-conjugating enzyme for LUBAC (Lewis MJ et al. 2015; Fu B et al.
  2014). LUBAC was shown to catalyze Met1-linked ubiquitination of RIPK1 at K627 upon
  co-expression of Flag-RIPK1 with Myc-tagged components of LUBAC (HOIP, HOIL1, and
  SHARPIN) in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells (Tu H et al. 2021). Linear
  ubiquitination of mouse Ripk1 on K612 (K627 in human) inhibited TNF-α–induced apoptosis
  and necroptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. Mutagenesis analysis
  further confirmed the importance of the K627 (K612 in mouse) ubiquitination site
  of RIPK1 in the TNFR1 signaling pathway (Li X et al. 2020). Further, LUBAC is known
  to ubiquitinate IKBKG (NEMO), a regulatory component of the IKK complex. LUBAC-mediated
  IKBKG ubiquitination enhanced IKBKG interaction with the TNFR1 signaling complex
  and stabilized this protein complex to promote activation of NF-kappa-B (Haas TL
  et al. 2009). Importantly, deletion of the LUBAC component SHARPIN in mice or mutation
  of HOIL-1 in humans, leads to hyperinflammatory phenotypes, indicating key roles
  of LUBAC and linear Ub chains in the response to infection and inflammation (Gerlach
  B et al. 2011; Ikeda F et al. 2011; Tokunaga F et al. 2011; Boisson B et al. 2012).
  The data suggest that LUBAC-mediated linear ubiquitylation of RIPK1 limits TNF-α–induced
  cell death. LUBAC activity is regulated by deubiquitinases (DUBs) such as OTULIN
  and CYLD, which hydrolyze Ub chains to reverse the modification of target proteins
  (Takiuchi T et al. 2014). OTULIN and CYLD associate with HOIP, the catalytic subunit
  of LUBAC, to cleave Ub chains in a linkage-specific fashion. OTULIN exclusively
  hydrolyzes Met1-Ub, while CYLD disassembles both Met1-Ub and Lys63-Ub (Fiil BK et
  al. 2013; Harhaj EW and Dixit VM 2012; Hrdinka M et al. 2016; Sato Y 2022). The
  CYLD interaction with LUBAC is facilitated by spermatogenesis-associated protein
  2 (SPATA2) (Elliott PR et al. 2016; Kupka S et al. 2016; Schlicher L et al. 2016;
  Wagner SA et al. 2016). The CYLD:SPATA2:LUBAC complex is rapidly recruited into
  the TNFR1 signaling complex to regulate ubiquitination/deubiquitination downstream
  of TNFR1 (Wagner SA et al. 2016; Elliott PR et al. 2016; Kupka S et al. 2016; Schlicher
