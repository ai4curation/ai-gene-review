display_name: RAD52 promotes single strand annealing at resected DNA DSBs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAD52 promotes annealing of 3' ssDNA overhangs at resected DNA double-strand
  breaks (DSBs) through complementary regions. The complementarity between the two
  3' ssDNA overhangs at resected DNA DSBs exists if 3' ssDNA overhangs contain direct
  repeats. While single strand annealing (SSA) requires significant homology between
  the annealed sequences it is nonetheless mutagenic. The parts of two 3' overhanging
  DNA single strands at resected DSBs that lie 3' to the annealed regions become displaced
  as flaps and subsequently excised. This results in the deletion (loss) of the DNA
  sequence lying between the two regions of homology used for SSA, as well as the
  deletion of one of the repeats used for annealing (Parsons et al. 2000, Van Dyck
  et al. 2001, Singleton et al. 2002, Stark et al. 2004, Mansour et al. 2008).
