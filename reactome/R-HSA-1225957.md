summary: 'SOS1 is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAS. SOS1, recruited

  of RAF/MAP kinase cascade, through detection of phosphorylated ERK1/2, has been
  demonstrated in cells expressing EGFR L858R mutant (Sordella et al. 2004, Paez et
  al. 2004, Shimamura et al. 2005), EGFR E746_A750 mutant (Sordella et al. 2004, Shimamura

## Summary

SOS1 is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAS. SOS1, recruited by GRB2 bound to p-SHC1:p-EGFR mutants, is assumed to activate RAS nucleotide exchange from the inactive form (bound to GDP) to an active form (bound to GTP). Although this reaction has not been shown to occur directly for EGFR cancer mutants, activation of RAF/MAP kinase cascade, through detection of phosphorylated ERK1/2, has been demonstrated in cells expressing EGFR L858R mutant (Sordella et al. 2004, Paez et al. 2004, Shimamura et al. 2005), EGFR E746_A750 mutant (Sordella et al. 2004, Shimamura et al. 2005), EGFR L747_P753delinS mutant (Sordella et al. 2004), and EGFR E746_A750del;T790M double mutant (Shimamura et al. 2005).
