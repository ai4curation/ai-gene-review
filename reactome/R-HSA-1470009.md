display_name: Phosphorylation of STATs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: JAK2 activation results in the phosphorylation and activation of STAT1alpha,
  STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B (Deberry et al. 1997, Brizzi et al. 1999, Ning et al. 2001,
  Ronnstrand 2004). STAT family members can be activated by JAK kinases, receptor
  tyrosine kinases or SFKs. LYN kinase has been identified to have role in SCF-induced
  phosphorylation of STAT3 (Shivakrupa & Linnekin 2005).
