display_name: Proinsulin binds zinc and calcium forming Proinsulin:zinc:calcium
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the presence of high concentrations of zinc and calcium, proinsulin spontaneously
  forms soluble complexes containing 6 molecules of proinsulin, 2 zinc ions, and 1
  calcium ion. Zinc Transporters ZnT5, ZnT6, and ZnT7  are found in the membrane of
  the Golgi in pancreatic cells (and also in many other cell types). They play a role
  in maintaining the high zinc concentration in the Golgi lumen and thus catalyze
  the formation of the proinsulin-zinc-calcium complex. Other transporters, such as
  the newly identified ZnT9 and ZnT10, may also be involved but this is presently
  unknown.
