display_name: Defective MyD88 does not oligomerize within the activated TLR2/4 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: All TLRs, except for TLR3, employ the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway.
  Autosomal recessive MyD88 deficiency predispose affected patients to recurrent pyogenic
  bacterial infection due to abolished TLR-mediated cytokine responses of the blood
  cells (von Bernuth H et al. 2008; Currie AJ et al. 2004). Here we describe several
  natural loss-of-function MyD88 variants (E52del, L93P, E65del, S34T) that showed
  severely reduced NFkB activation in human cell-based assays due to reduced homooligomerization
  and IRAK4 interaction, the two crucial events in the assembly of the Myddosome complex
  (George J et al. 2011; Nagpal K et al. 2011; Yamamoto T et al. 2014).

## Summary

All TLRs, except for TLR3, employ the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. Autosomal recessive MyD88 deficiency predispose affected patients to recurrent pyogenic bacterial infection due to abolished TLR-mediated cytokine responses of the blood cells (von Bernuth H et al. 2008; Currie AJ et al. 2004). Here we describe several natural loss-of-function MyD88 variants (E52del, L93P, E65del, S34T) that showed severely reduced NFkB activation in human cell-based assays due to reduced homooligomerization and IRAK4 interaction, the two crucial events in the assembly of the Myddosome complex (George J et al. 2011; Nagpal K et al. 2011; Yamamoto T et al. 2014).
