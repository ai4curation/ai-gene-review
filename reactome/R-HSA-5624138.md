display_name: Trafficking of myristoylated proteins to the cilium
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A number of myristoylated proteins have been shown to traffic to the cilium
  in a myristoyl- and  UNC119B:ARL3:RP2-dependent fashion. These include the ciliary
  proteins Nephrocystin 3 (NPHP3) and Cystin 1 (CYS1) (Wright et al, 2011; reviewed
  in Schwarz et al, 2012). Myristoyl-binding by the ARL3 effector UNC119B is required
  in an unknown fashion for the transport of the myristoylated cargo to the cilium.
  At the cilium, a GTPase cycle involving the ARF-like small GTPase ARL3 and its GAP
  protein RP2 promote the release of the myristoylated proteins into the ciliary membrane
  and the recycling and ciliary exit of UNC119B (Wright et al, 2011; reviewed in Schwarz
  et al, 2012). ARL3 plays additional roles in the cilium coordinating the association
  of IFT A and IFT B complexes with the kinesin motors (Li et al, 2010; reviewed in
  Li et al, 2012).
