display_name: CR:atREs binds apoE and HSPG
species: Homo sapiens
summary: When the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is missing, saturated or
  inhibited, chylomicron remnants (CRs) containing all-trans-retinyl esters (atREs)
  bind  apolioprotein E (apoE). ApoE, secreted by hepatocytes, acts as a high-affinity
  ligand for the LDL-related receptor protein (LRP) family. CR:atREs:apoE then binds
  to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), abundant in the space of Disse.
  HSPG/apoE  binding plays a critical role in the capture of CR:atREs, ready for internalization
  via LRPs (Futamura et al. 2005, Yamauchi et al. 2008).
