summary: After assembly of the complete RNA polymerase II-preinitiation complex, the

  as the closed-to-open complex transition and occurs prior to the initiation of mRNA
  synthesis. In the RNA polymerase II system this step requires the hydrolysis of
  ATP or dATP into Pi and ADP or dADP (in contrast to the other RNA polymerase systems)
  and is catalyzed by the XPB subunit of TFIIH. The region of the promoter, which
  becomes single-stranded , spans from –10 to +2 relative to the transcription start
  site.<p>Negative supercoiling in the promoter region probably induces transient
  opening events and can alleviate requirement of TFIIE, TFIIH and  ATP-hydrolysis
  for open complex formation.  ATP is also used in this step by the cdk7-subunit of
  TFIIH to phosphorylate the heptad repeats of the C-terminal domain of the largest
  subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1) on serine-2
