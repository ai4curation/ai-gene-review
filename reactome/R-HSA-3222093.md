display_name: BRD7 binds TP53 and EP300
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The N-terminal region of BRD7, upstream of its bromodomain that is responsible
  for interaction with chromatin, binds the C-terminus of TP53 (p53) (Drost et al.
  2010, Burrows et al. 2010). BRD7 also binds and can recruit EP300 (p300) to TP53
  target promoters CDKN1A and MDM2 (Drost et al. 2010). BRD7 positively regulates
  transcription of other TP53 targets: SERPINE1, TIGAR (Bensaad et al. 2006), TNFRSF10C
  and NDGR1, presumably via a similar mechanism as in the case of CDKN1A and MDM2
  (Drost et al. 2010, Burrows et al. 2010). '

## Summary

The N-terminal region of BRD7, upstream of its bromodomain that is responsible for interaction with chromatin, binds the C-terminus of TP53 (p53) (Drost et al. 2010, Burrows et al. 2010). BRD7 also binds and can recruit EP300 (p300) to TP53 target promoters CDKN1A and MDM2 (Drost et al. 2010). BRD7 positively regulates transcription of other TP53 targets: SERPINE1, TIGAR (Bensaad et al. 2006), TNFRSF10C and NDGR1, presumably via a similar mechanism as in the case of CDKN1A and MDM2 (Drost et al. 2010, Burrows et al. 2010).
