display_name: CRY is phosphorylated by SGG
species: Drosophila melanogaster
summary: The blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) is phosphorylated on unknown
  serine/threonine residues by GSK3beta kinase orthologue, Shaggy (SGG).  Phosphorylation
  appears to attenuate the function of CRY and it doesn't degrade Timeless (TIM).  Earlier
  studies suggested that the effect of SGG on the light-mediated degradation of TIM
  was due to direct phosphorylation of TIM by SGG (Martinek et al., 2001), however,
  more recent experiments suggest the actual target of SGG in this pathway is CRY
  (Storelu et al., 2007).
