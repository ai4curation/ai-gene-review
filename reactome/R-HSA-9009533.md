display_name: TBP and TFIIA bind TATA box on  ESR1:estrogen bound TFF1 gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TFIIA and TBP are recruited to the TFF1 promoter early during transcriptional
  activation and are often found at the promoter with DDX5 (Métivier et al, 2003;
  reviewed in Caretti et al, 2007).
