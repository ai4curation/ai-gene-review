display_name: POLK forms a quaternary complex with REV1 and POLZ on damaged DNA template
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DNA polymerase kappa (POLK) forms a quaternary complex with REV1 and the
  DNA polymerase zeta (POLZ) heterodimer, composed of REV3L and MAD2L2 (REV7), at
  DNA damage sites (Ohashi et al. 2009, Wojtaszek et al. 2012a, Wojtaszek et al. 2012b,
  Xie et al. 2012). POLK simultaneously interacts with the C-terminus of REV1 through
  its RIR (REV1-interacting region) (Ohashi et al. 2009) and with monoubiquitinated
  PCNA (Haracska et al. 2002, Bi et al. 2006). POLK requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ for its
  activity. POLK is more catalytically active in the presence of Mn2+, but exhibits
  higher fidelity in the presence of Mg2+ (Pence et al. 2012)
