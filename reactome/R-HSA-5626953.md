stable_id: R-HSA-5626953
display_name: TNF-α:TNFR1 binds DENN/MADD
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MAPK activating death domain (MADD) and DENN-SV are known to directly interact
  with TNFR1 cytoplasmic tail (Al-Zoubi AM et al. 2001). MADD and DENN-SV are two
  of at least six splice variants of IG20 gene. MADD and DENN-SV are constitutively
  expressed in all tissues and at much higher levels in cancer cells and tissues (Al-Zoubi
  AM et al. 2001; Lim KM et al. 2004). The expression of other IG20 isoforms, such
  as KIAA0358 and IG20-SV4, can be restricted to certain neuronal tissues (Li L et
  al. 2008). Regulation of expression of various splice variants can profoundly affect
  cancer cell survival, proliferation, or death (Efimova EV et al. 2004). Knockdown
  of IG20 using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) resulted in spontaneous apoptosis in HeLa
  (cervical cancer), PA-1 (ovarian carcinoma), WRO (follicular carcinoma) and FRO
  (anaplastic carcinoma) cells (Mulherkar N et al. 2006; Mulherkar N. et al. 2007;
  Subramanian M et al. 2009). MADD and DENN-SV have been shown to stimulate TNF-alpha
  and TRAIL-induced upregulation of prosurvival proteins suppressing caspase-8 activation
  (Kurada BR et al. 2009; Mulherkar N. et al. 2007; Subramanian M et al. 2009).
