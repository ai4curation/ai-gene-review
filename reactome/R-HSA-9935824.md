  spacer (5'ETS)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After oligoadenylation by the TRAMP complex, the oligoadenylated 5' external
  transcribed sequence (5'ETS) cleaved from the 47S pre-rRNA is 3'-5' exonucleolytically
  hydrolyzed by the RNA exosome, which is bound to the TRAMP complex (Lubas et al.
  2011, Sudo et al. 2016).

## Summary

After oligoadenylation by the TRAMP complex, the oligoadenylated 5' external transcribed sequence (5'ETS) cleaved from the 47S pre-rRNA is 3'-5' exonucleolytically hydrolyzed by the RNA exosome, which is bound to the TRAMP complex (Lubas et al. 2011, Sudo et al. 2016).
