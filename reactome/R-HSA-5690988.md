display_name: 3'-incision of DNA by ERCC5 (XPG) in GG-NER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), as well as transcription-coupled
  nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), the cleavage of the damaged DNA strand 3' to
  the site of damage is carried out by a DNA endonuclease XPG (ERCC5). While the DNA
  repair synthesis may be initiated prior to the 3' incision (Staresincic et al. 2009),
  the components of the incision complex probably dissociate from the NER site shortly
  after the replicative complex assembly and 3' incision (Overmeer et al. 2011). The
  exception is the RPA heterotrimer, which is a constituent of the DNA synthesis complex,
  and also coats the undamaged DNA strand, thereby protecting it from endonucleolytic
  cleavage.
