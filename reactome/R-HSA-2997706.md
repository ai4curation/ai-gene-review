stable_id: R-HSA-2997706
display_name: MDM2 SUMOylates TP53 with SUMO2,3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MDM2 in a complex with CDKN2A (p14-ARF) SUMOylates TP53 (p53) with SUMO2,3
  at lysine-386 (Stindt et al. 2011, Hendriks et al. 2014, Tammsalu et al. 2014).
  SUMOylation decreases transcriptional activation by TP53 at some genes and decreases
  repression by TP53 at other genes (Stindt et al. 2011).

## Summary

MDM2 in a complex with CDKN2A (p14-ARF) SUMOylates TP53 (p53) with SUMO2,3 at lysine-386 (Stindt et al. 2011, Hendriks et al. 2014, Tammsalu et al. 2014). SUMOylation decreases transcriptional activation by TP53 at some genes and decreases repression by TP53 at other genes (Stindt et al. 2011).
