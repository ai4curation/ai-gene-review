display_name: Formation of C-strand Okazaki fragments
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After RFC initiates the assembly of the primer recognition complex, the complex
  of pol delta and PCNA is responsible for incorporating the additional nucleotides
  prior to the position of the next downstream initiator RNA primer. On the lagging
  strand, short discontinuous segments of DNA, called Okazaki fragments, are synthesized
  on RNA primers. The average length of the Okazaki fragments is 100 nucleotides.
  Polymerase switching is a key event that allows the processive synthesis of DNA
  by the pol delta and PCNA complex (Lee and Hurwitz 1990, Tsurimoto and Stillman
  1991, Nethanel et al. 1992, Brown and Campbell 1993, Waga et al.1994, Bambara et
  al. 1997). PCNA increases the processivity of the DNA polymerase delta during telomeric
  C-strand synthesis in a human telomere replication model, but it does not eliminate
  the DNA polymerase delta stalling on the G-rich template (Lormand et al. 2013).
