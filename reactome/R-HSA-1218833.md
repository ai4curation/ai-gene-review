display_name: Binding of ligand-responsive EGFR mutants to chaperoning proteins HSP90
  and CDC37
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'EGFR kinase domain mutants need continuous association with HSP90 chaperone
  protein for proper functioning. CDC37 is a co-chaperone of HSP90 that acts as a
  scaffold and regulator of interaction between HSP90 and its protein kinase clients.
  CDC37 binds a protein kinase through its N-terminal domain and HSP90 through its
  C-terminal domain, arresting ATP-ase activity of HSP90 and enabling the loading
  of a client kinase. CDC37 is frequently over-expressed in cancers involving mutant
  kinases and acts as an oncogene (reviewed by Gray Jr. et al. 2008). Association
  of EGFR extracellular domain point mutants with HSP90 chaperone has not been tested. '

CDC37 is a co-chaperone of HSP90 that acts as a scaffold and regulator of interaction between HSP90 and its protein kinase clients. CDC37 binds a protein kinase through its N-terminal domain and HSP90 through its C-terminal domain, arresting ATP-ase activity of HSP90 and enabling the loading of a client kinase. CDC37 is frequently over-expressed in cancers involving mutant kinases and acts as an oncogene (reviewed by Gray Jr. et al. 2008). Association of EGFR extracellular domain point mutants with HSP90 chaperone has not been tested.
