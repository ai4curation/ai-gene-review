display_name: Dynein motors transport misfolded proteins
species: Cercopithecus aethiops
summary: Misfolded proteins are transported from the microtubule to the microtubule-organizing
  center (MTOC) in a dynein-mediated mechanism. Dynein motors carry the cargo along
  the microtubules from the plus end to the minus end (Garcia Mata R et al. 1999).
