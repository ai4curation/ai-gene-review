display_name: IL24:IL22RA1:p-JAK1:IL20RB binds STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is believed to
  bind the Interleukin-24 (IL24) receptor complex (Parrish Novak et al. 2002, Wang
  et al. 2002, Andoh et al. 2009). There are two forms of the IL24 receptor. The receptor
  complex represented here consists of IL24, Interleukin 22 receptor subunit alpha
  1 (IL22RA1), phosphorylated Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and Interleukin-20
  receptor subunit beta (IL20RB). Both forms of the IL24 receptor can activate STAT3
  (Dumoutier et al. 2001, Wang et al. 2002). Based on the consensus understanding
  of JAK/STAT signaling, STAT3 activation is very likely to be preceded by STAT3 binding
  to the IL24 receptor. <br><br>This is a black box event because STAT3 binding is
  inferred as a prerequisite for STAT3 phosphorylation, based on STAT3 binding by
  the related IL10 receptor (Riley et al. 1999). <br><br><br><br>
