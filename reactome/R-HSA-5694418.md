display_name: RAB1:GTP binds USO1 and GORASP1:GOLGA2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Protein protein interactions involving activated RAB1:GTP help dock the ER-derived
  vesicle on the cis-Golgi membrane (reviewed in Lord et al, 2013) .  Independently,
  RAB:GTP interacts with both the USO1 homodimer (a long coiled coil tethering factor
  also known as p115) and the GOLGA2 component of the GOLGA2:GORASP1 complex on the
  cis-Golgi membrane (Allan et al, 2000; Moyer et al, 2001; Weide et al, 2001).  USO1
  also contacts GOLGA2 directly (Nakamura et al, 1997; Seeman et al, 2000). t-SNARES
  such as STX5, GOSR1and GOSR2 also participate in this complex on the cis-ERGIC membrane
  (Brandon et al, 2006; Shorter et al, 2002; reviewed in Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013).
