species: Homo sapiens
summary: IFT particles were first characterized in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, where
  they were observed by differential interference contrast microscopy as electron-dense
  granules that move along doublet microtubules of the ciliary axoneme (Kozminski
  et al, 1993; Kozminski et al, 1995; reviewed in Pedersen et al, 2008). More recent
  ultrastructural analysis of Chlamydomonas flagella confirms the presence of two
  distinct types of IFT trains, a longer, less electron-opaque anterograde train and
  shorter, more opaque retrograde trains. Both the anterograde and retrograde trains
  are associated with the outer microtubule doublets and with the inner surface of
  the flagellar membrane (Pigino et al, 2009). Isolation and characterization of IFT
  particles revealed that they consist of 2 biochemically distinct subcomplexes, IFT
  A and IFT B that are widely conserved in ciliated organisms (Piperno et al, 1997;
  Cole et al, 1998; reviewed in Sung and Leroux, 2013). Anterograde traffic is driven
  by kinesin-2 type motors in an ATP-dependent manner. Evidence from C. elegans suggests
  distinct and sequential roles for the canonical heterotrimeric kinesin-2 motor and
  the alternate homodimeric kinesin-2, OSM-3 (homologue of human KIF17) in mediating
  anterograde transport, but this has not been demonstrated in human cells where the
  canonical kinesin-2 motor predominates (Evans et al, 2006; Snow et al, 2004; Ou
  et al, 2005). Human KIF17 appears to be required in some cell types for cilia formation,
  and plays a role in the import of some ciliary cargo (Jenkins et al, 2006; Insinna
  et al, 2008; Insinna et al, 2009; Dishinger et al, 2010; reviewed in Verhey et al,
  2011). Assembly of the anterograde IFT trains at the base of the cilium may be facilitated
  by the BBSome complex, which has also been shown to display IFT-like movement along
  the axoneme; however, the BBSome is highly sub-stoichiometric with respect to the
  IFT complex, so this notion requires more substantiation (Ou et al, 2005; Wei et
  al, 2012; Blacque et al, 2004; Nachury et al, 2007; Lechtreck et al, 2009; reviewed
  in Sung and Leroux, 2013). Studies in C. elegans also suggest a role for ARL13B
  and ARL3 in regulating the stability of the anterograde IFT train (Li et al, 2010).
