display_name: Binding of calnexin/calreticulin to the unfolded protein
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Calnexin (membrane protein) and calreticulin (soluble in ER) are two lectins
  (proteins that can bind a glycan) which recognize the mono-glucosylated form of
  the N-glycan and mediate the folding of the glycoproteins to which they are attached
  to (Ou WJ et al, 1993; Nauseef Wm et al, 1995). Calmegin is another chaperone with
  the same role expressed only in testis (van Lith M et al, 2007). These lectins act
  as chaperons, providing a protected environment where the unfolded glycoprotein
  can fold without forming interactions with other proteins or components in the ER.
  The unfolded protein can loop between these two steps multiple time, therefore this
  process is called the 'calnexin/calreticulin cycle'. If the protein achieves correct
  folding, it is modified by Mannosidase I and then moved to the cis-Golgi where the
  glycan is further processed.
