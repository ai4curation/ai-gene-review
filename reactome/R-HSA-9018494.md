display_name: FOXA1 and GATA3 bind TFF genes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Trefoil factor family (TFF) 1 and 3 are secreted in mucous epithelia and
  the nervous system and have been implicated in oncogenesis and metastasis (reviewed
  in Busch and Dünker, 2015). TFF1 and 3 are estrogen-responsive genes with ESR1-bound
  promoters/enhancers that are primed for ligand-dependent expression by the binding
  of 'pioneer' transcription factors, such as FOXA1 and GATA3 (Berry et al, 1989;
  Shang et al, 2000; Carroll et al, 2005; Laganière et al, 2005; Eeckhoute et al,
  2006;  Hurtado et al, 2011; Kong et al, 2011; Theodorou et al, 2013; reviewed in
  Zaret and Carroll, 2011; Augello et al, 2011; Fiorito et al, 2013; Wilson and Giguere,
  2008). FOXA factors have a winged helix structure that is thought to bind to closed
  chromatin structures in a manner analogous to linker histones, displacing linker
  histones and rendering the DNA more accessible to other transcription factors (reviewed
  in Zaret and Carroll, 2011). FOXA binding sites tend to be enriched at enhancer
  elements, characterized by H3K4 mono- and dimethylation and H3K27 acetylation, active
  histone markers (Heintzman et al, 2009; Creyghton et al, 2010; Theodorou et al,
  2013).
