species: Homo sapiens
summary: β-TrCP (BTRC) is the substrate recognizing subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase
  complex SCF (Skip-Cullin-F-box). PD-L1 (CD274) contains a β-TrCP destruction box
  domain next to GSK3β phosphorylation sites that facilitates binding of β-TrCP with
  PD-L1. Using six histidine-tagged ubiquitin to pull down substrates that covalently
  conjugated with ubiquitin, Li et al, 2016 shows that β-TrCP-SCF complex catalyses
  PD-L1 ubiquitination in the presence of GSK3β. Deletion of the destruction box domain
  or mutation of the GSK3B phosphorylation motif abrogates GSK3β-mediated PD-L1 ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation, reflecting the involvement of β-TrCP-SCF ubiquitin-E3
  ligase activity in PD-L1 stability.
