stable_id: R-HSA-909730
display_name: Phosphorylation of INFAR1 by TYK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TYK2 functions as part of a receptor complex to trigger intracellular signaling
  in response to IFNA/B. TYK2 bound to IFNAR1 subunit is activated in response to
  IFNA/B treatment and this in turn phosphorylates two tyrosine residues Y466 and
  Y481 in the juxta-membrane region of IFNAR1.
