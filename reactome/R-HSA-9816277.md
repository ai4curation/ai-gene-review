summary: 'CDH1 (also known as E-cadherin, epithelial cadherin, Cadherin-1, CADH1,
  or uvomorulin) undergoes evolutionarily conserved O-mannosylation on multiple serine
  and threonine residues in its ectodomains (cadherin domains) 2 to 5 in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (Lommel et al. 2013; Vester-Christensen et al. 2013; Carvalho et al. 2016;
  Larsen et al. 2017; Graham et al. 2020). O-mannosylation of CDH1, the major cell-adhesion
  molecule in mouse blastomeres, was first reported to be crucial for cadherin-based
  cell adhesion during early mouse embryonic development (Lommel et al. 2013). Mouse
  embryos knockout for either POMT1 or POMT2, two endoplasmic reticulum O-mannosyltransferases
  that function as the POMT1:POMT2 complex, are O-mannosylation-deficient and die
  early during development (Lommel et al. 2013). <i>Pomt1</i> knockout embryos do
  form blastocysts but die immediately upon implantation, while <i>Pomt2</i> knockout
  embryos fail to progress from the morula to the blastocyst stage (Lommel et al.
  2013). This difference is possibly due to a higher level of maternal Pomt1 mRNA
  than maternal Pomt2 mRNA in mouse eggs, which results in a temporary compensation
  of the <i>Pomt1</i> gene loss (Lommel et la. 2013). Inhibition of O-mannosylation
  negatively affects cell-cell aggregation in the canine MDCK kidney-derived cell
  line, where mannosylation of both E-cadherin and K-cadherin is affected (Lommel
  et al. 2013). O-linked mannose residues on CDH1 are not elongated further (Lommel
  et al. 2013; Vester-Christensen et al. 2013; Larsen et al. 2017). Cadherins, including
  CDH1, as well as related protocadherins, were found to be one of the major carriers
  of O-Man glycans, with 37 cadherins/protocadherins identified as O-Man glycans in
  the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (Vester-Christensen et al. 2013). While
  the consensus sequence of the O-mannosylated serine/threonine residues has not been
  established, mass spectrometry has identified evolutionarily conserved CDH1 O-mannosylated
  residues at S280, T285, T358, T470, T472, T509, T576, T578, and T580 that are shared
  with at least one of the other related Cadherin type I subfamily members (Vester-Christensen
  et al. 2013: in this paper, the amino acid residues are counted using the first
  amino acid in the mature CDH1 as the start coordinate, which represents amino acid
  155 in the nascent protein, so that the aforementioned residues correspond to residues
  S126, T131, T204, T316, T318, T355, T422, T424, and T426 in the paper, respectively).
  O-mannosylation of CDH1 is significantly reduced in gastric carcinoma compared with
  the adjacent normal gastric mucosa (Carvalho et al. 2016). Reduced CDH1 expression
  and mislocalization in the human gastric cancer cell line Kato III is associated
  with reduced mRNA and protein levels of POMT1 (Carvalho et al. 2016). POMT2 knockdown
  in human gastric carcinoma cells reduces CDH1 stability at the plasma membrane,
  localization to cell-cell borders, and the association with CTNND1 (also known as
  p120 catenin or delta catenin) (Carvalho et al. 2016). CDH1 can still undergo O-mannosylation
  in the absence of POMT1 and POMT2 (Larsen et al. 2017), and another endoplasmic
  reticulum O-mannosyltransferase, TMTC3, was reported to contribute to CDH1 O-mannosylation
  (Graham et al. 2020).'

## Summary

CDH1 (also known as E-cadherin, epithelial cadherin, Cadherin-1, CADH1, or uvomorulin) undergoes evolutionarily conserved O-mannosylation on multiple serine and threonine residues in its ectodomains (cadherin domains) 2 to 5 in the endoplasmic reticulum (Lommel et al. 2013; Vester-Christensen et al. 2013; Carvalho et al. 2016; Larsen et al. 2017; Graham et al. 2020).
