species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once the viral gp120 protein has bound to cellular CD4, its bridging sheet
  region becomes exposed/formed as a result of conformation changes in the V1 and
  V2 loops as well as a conformational change in the gp120 core domain.  Once this
  region is exposed, it is free to bind the HIV co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 (also known
  as chemokine receptors).  Different viruses use different co-receptors (CCR5 or
  CXCR4) for entry, and many studies investigated the structural determinants of interaction
  between gp120 and the co-receptor. <br>Studies of CCR5 binding by gp120 revealed
  that active regions in the second extracellular loop (ECL2), the N-terminal extracellular
  domain (specifically the NYYTSE motif) and at the junction between the fifth transmembrane
  domain and third cytoplasmic loop of the receptor are important for viral attachment
  and subsequent fusion.  The N-terminal region likely interacts with the core of
  gp120 (bridging sheet and adjacent regions) and the base of V3, while ECL2 may be
  important for interacting with the tip of V3.  The transmembrane 5 / cytoplasmic
  loop 3 junction of CCR5 has been shown to influence the conformation of the receptor
  which allows for subsequent binding of gp120 (Wang et al.,1999).  Deletion of the
  V3 loop in gp120 abolished Env interaction with co-receptor without affecting the
  binding of soluble gp120 to CD4, underscoring the importance of this loop in chemokine
  receptor, but not CD4, binding.  Furthermore, the V3 loop is a major determinant
  of coreceptor specificity, with amino acid at positions 11 and 25 being partly predictive
  of CCR5 or CXCR4 use.  Single amino acid changes in V3 can alter coreceptor use,
  however sequences outside of V3 can also contribute to coreceptor specificity. <br>
