display_name: Translocation of Glut4 Vesicle and Docking at the Plasma Membrane
species: Mus musculus
summary: Glut4 (Slc2a4) initially translocates from endosomes to insulin-responsive  vesicles
  (IRVs, GSVs). Rab11 appears to play a role in this process. IRVs bearing Glut4 are
  then translocated across the cortical actin network to the plasma membrane. Unconventional
  myosin 5A (Myo5a) interacts with RAB10 or RAB8A on the vesicle and participates
  in transport of the IRV. Myosin 1C appears to act close to the plasma membrane and
  may facilitate fusion of the vesicle with the plasma membrane. RAB:GTP complexes
  coupled to the vesicles may interact with myosins to regulate their activity. Non-muscle
  myosin IIA (Myh9) appears to interact with the SNAP23 complex to dock the IRV at
  the inner membrane face.
