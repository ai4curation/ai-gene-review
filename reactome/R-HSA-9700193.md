stable_id: R-HSA-9700193
display_name: ALK mutants phosphorylate SHC1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SHC is tyrosine phosphorylated downstream of ALK fusion proteins. SHC may
  stimulate signaling through the MAP kinase cascade by virtue of its interaction
  with GRB2. The relative importance of this pathway to the oncogenic properties varies
  somewhat among different fusion proteins (Fujimoto et al, 1996; Trinei et al, 2000;
  Hernandez et al, 2002; Ren et al, 2012; reviewed in Hallberg and Palmer, 2013; Hallberg
  and Palmer, 2016).

## Summary

The relative importance of this pathway to the oncogenic properties varies somewhat among different fusion proteins (Fujimoto et al, 1996; Trinei et al, 2000; Hernandez et al, 2002; Ren et al, 2012; reviewed in Hallberg and Palmer, 2013; Hallberg and Palmer, 2016).
