display_name: p-DVL2 recruits AP-2 and beta-arrestin 2 to promote clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Evidence suggests that FZD4 is endocytosed in a clathrin- and AP-2-dependent
  manner upon stimulation with WNT5A.  Direct interactions have been demonstrated
  between DVL2 and the AP-2 component mu 2 mediated by simultaneous interaction with
  the DEP domain and a tetrapeptide motif YHEL of DVL2. Mutation of these regions
  abrogates FZD4 internalization and PCP signaling (Yu et al, 2007; Yu et al, 2010).  DVL2
  also interacts with beta-arrestin2 (ARBB2) in a PKC-dependent manner, and in vitro
  phosphorylation of DVL2 by PKC enhances the interaction between DVL2 and ARBB2 as
  assessed by co-immunoprecipitation (Chen et al, 2003). There is conflicting evidence
  on the requirement for ARBB2 for the internalization of FZD4 upon WNT5A signaling,
  however (Chen et al, 2003; Yu et al, 2007).
