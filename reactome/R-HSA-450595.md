## Summary

mRNA bound to HuR is exported from the nucleus by a mechanism that requires the shuttle protein APRIL but not pp32. Phosphorylation of APRIL determines its subcellular localization: APRIL phosphorylated at threonine244 is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm while APRIL that is not phosphorylated at threonine244 is cytoplasmic.<br>HuR bound to mRNAs in the cytoplasm acts to stabilize the mRNAs by an unknown mechanism.
