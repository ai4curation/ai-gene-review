stable_id: R-HSA-975119
display_name: NEMO subunit of IKK complex binds to activated IRAK1 upon stimulation
  of TLR7/8 or 9
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NF-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMO, also known as IKKG abbreviated from
  Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit gamma) is the regulatory subunit
  of the IKK complex which phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B leading to dissociation
  of the inhibitor/NF-kappa-B complex. NEMO binds to K63-pUb chains (Ea et al. 2006;
  Wu et al. 2006), linking K63-pUb-hp-IRAK1 with the IKK complex. Models of IL-1R
  dependent activation of NF-kappaB suggest that the polyubiquitination of both TRAF6
  and IRAK1 within a TRAF6:IRAK1 complex and their subsequent interactions with the
  TAK1 complex and IKK complex respectively brings these complexes into proximity,
  facilitating the TAK1-catalyzed activation of IKK (Moynagh, 2008).
