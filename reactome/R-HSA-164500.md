display_name: Conformational changes in gp120 exposes gp41
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The HIV protein known as gp41 is a transmembrane protein which is considered
  the major mediator of fusion of extracellular virions to the target cells in the
  host. HIV gp120 and gp41 proteins form non-covalently linked oligomers on the surface
  of virions.  The gp41 subunit of the oligomer is anchored in the viral membrane
  and contains a non-polar fusion peptide at its N-terminus. Upon CD4 and receptor
  binding, gp120 undergoes a second conformation change. The conformation change exposes
  gp41 which continues to mediate fusion of the viral envelope with the host plasma
  membrane. Electron microscopy and circular dichroism measurements of the gp41 protein
  suggest a rod-like conformation with a high alpha-helical content. Although some
  studies suggest that gp41must dissociate from gp120 in order to cause fusion between
  HIV envelope and the target cell plasma membrane, evidence on this point is not
  conclusive.
