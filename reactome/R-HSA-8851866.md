display_name: MET binds RANBP10
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The sprouty (SPRY) domain of RANBP10 binds the tyrosine kinase domain of
  MET. RANBP10 binding inhibits binding of RANBP9 to MET and, as RANBP10 does not
  interact with SOS1, RANBP10 binding interferes with RAS activation (Wang et al.
  2004).

## Summary

The sprouty (SPRY) domain of RANBP10 binds the tyrosine kinase domain of MET. RANBP10 binding inhibits binding of RANBP9 to MET and, as RANBP10 does not interact with SOS1, RANBP10 binding interferes with RAS activation (Wang et al. 2004).
