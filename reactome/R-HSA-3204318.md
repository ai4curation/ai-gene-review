display_name: cob(II)alamin is transferred from MMACHC:MMADHC:cob(II)alamin to MTRR:MTR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In a sequence of events that is still not well understood, cob(II)alamin
  is transferred from its complex with MMACHC (Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria
  type C protein) and MMADHC (Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type D protein)
  to the complex of MTRR (methionine synthase reductase) and methionine synthase (MTR)
  (Banerjee et al. 2021; Deme et al. 2012; Mah et al. 2013; Plesa et al. 2011; Wolthers
