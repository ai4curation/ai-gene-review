stable_id: R-HSA-5218822
display_name: CRK binds BCAR1 and or PXN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CRK (CT10 Regulator of Kinase) is composed of one SH2 and one or two SH3
  domains. This adaptor protein binds with phosphorylated tyrosine motifs found in
  proteins involved in cell spreading, actin reorganisation, and cell migration. Paxillin
  (PAX) and p130CAS are the two major focal adhesion components that binds with CRK
  to form multiprotein signaling complexes and regulate cell migration (Klemke et
  al. 1998, Valles et al. 2004, Lamorte et al. 2003).
