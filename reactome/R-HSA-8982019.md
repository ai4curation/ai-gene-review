species: Homo sapiens
summary: G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) sense extracellular signals and activate
  different Guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). Upon activation, GPCRs
  can replace the GDP with GTP in the alpha subunit of G proteins. GTP binding modifies
  the conformation of G alpha proteins and activates them. The Regulator of G protein
  Signalling (RGS) proteins are GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs) that can inhibit
  the G alpha subunit activity via their GAP activity. There are at least 25 different
  types of RGS proteins known. Several of these RGS proteins (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21) can bind and stabilize the transition
  state for GTP hydrolysis of Guanine nucleotide binding protein G(i) subunit alpha
  (GNAI). Subsequently, this leads to GTP hydrolysis and inactivation of GNAI and
  terminating downstream signalling (Neubig & Siderovski DP 2002,  Kach et al. 2012).
  The primary function of GNAI is the inhibition of adenylate cyclase.

## Summary

G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) sense extracellular signals and activate different Guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). Upon activation, GPCRs can replace the GDP with GTP in the alpha subunit of G proteins. GTP binding modifies the conformation of G alpha proteins and activates them. The Regulator of G protein Signalling (RGS) proteins are GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs) that can inhibit the G alpha subunit activity via their GAP activity. There are at least 25 different types of RGS proteins known. Several of these RGS proteins (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21) can bind and stabilize the transition state for GTP hydrolysis of Guanine nucleotide binding protein G(i) subunit alpha (GNAI). Subsequently, this leads to GTP hydrolysis and inactivation of GNAI and terminating downstream signalling (Neubig & Siderovski DP 2002,  Kach et al. 2012).
