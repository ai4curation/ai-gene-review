stable_id: R-NUL-428519
display_name: Inactivation of Cdc42
species: Rattus norvegicus
summary: Human SRGAP, bound to the cytoplasmic tail of rat Robo1, increases the intrinsic
  GTPase activity of human CDC42, converting the GTP-bound form of CDC42 into its
  GDP-bound form, therefore inactivating CDC42 (Wong et al. 2001, Li et al. 2006).

## Summary
