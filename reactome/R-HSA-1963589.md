display_name: 'ERBB2 forms heterodimers with ligand-activated ERBB receptors: EGFR,
  ERBB3 and ERBB4'
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ERBB2, which does not bind any known ligand, is activated through formation
  of a heterodimer with another ligand-activated ERBB family member. ERBB2 heterodimerization
  partners are EGF-stimulated EGFR (Wada et al. 1990, Karunagaran et al. 1996), ERBB3
  stimulated by neuregulins NRG1 or NRG2 (Pinkas-Kramarski et al. 1996), and ERBB4
  stimulated by neuregulins or EGF-like ligands (Li et al. 2007). In the process of
  dimerization, ERBB2 dissociates from chaperone proteins HSP90 and CDC37 (Xu et al
  2001, Citri et al. 2004). Activated ERBB2 also dissociates from ERBB2IP, the protein
  responsible for proper localization of ERBB2 to basolateral membranes of epithelial
  cells (Borg et al. 2000).
