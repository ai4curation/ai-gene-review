stable_id: R-HSA-9934522
display_name: NEXT:ZC3H18:CBCA:m7GpppN-RNA binds the RNA exosome
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The EXOSC10 (RRP6, PM/Scl-100) subunit of the RNA exosome interacts with
  the MTREX (MTR4, SKIV2L2) subunit of the NEXT complex (Schilders et al. 2007, Lubas
  et al. 2011). The interaction of the RNA exosome with the MTREX subunit of the NEXT
  complex is stoichiometric. However, interaction with other subunits of the NEXT
  complex is substoichiometric (Andersen et al. 2013).
