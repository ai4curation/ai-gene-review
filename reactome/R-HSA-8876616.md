display_name: DENND6A,B exchange GTP for GDP on RAB14
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAB14 is involved in the trafficking of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and
  also contributes to cell migration by regulating the trafficking of ADAM10, a metalloendopetidase
  that cleaves a number of cell surface proteins including the adherens junction components
  N-cadherin (Reed et al, 2013; Brewer et al, 2016; Linford et al, 2012; Lu et al,
  2012; Maretzky et al, 2005; Reiss et al, 2005; Gutwein et al, 2010; Rabquer et al,
  2010).  DENND6A and B, also known as FAM116A and B, show RAB14 GEF activity in vitro
  and are required for RAB14 localization and activity in vivo (Linford et al, 2012;
  reviewed in Ishida et al, 2016). Interaction of RAB14:GDP with its GEFs promotes
  release of GDP, allowing GTP to bind, and precludes the interaction of RAB14 with
  GDI and CHM proteins.<br><br>
