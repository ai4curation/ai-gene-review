display_name: Phosphorylation of CD28
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The interaction of CD28 with its ligands, B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86), on
  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) enhances several TCR-mediated responses, including
  the production of interleukins such as IL-2. CD28-mediated costimulation is critically
  dependent on the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 191, located within the conserved
  'YMNM' motif of the CD28 cytoplasmic tail. This phosphorylation event is primarily
  catalyzed by the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn, which are activated following TCR
  engagement. <br>Upon phosphorylation, the tyrosine residue serves as a docking site
  for several key signaling molecules, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),
  growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), and the adaptor protein Grb2-related
  adaptor downstream of SHC (GADS). These molecules bind via their Src homology 2
  (SH2) domains and contribute to downstream signaling cascades essential for promoting
  T cell proliferation, survival, and cytokine production (Sadra et al. 1999).
