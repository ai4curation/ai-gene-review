display_name: CCNA:CDK1 phosphorylates CDC25B
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CCNA2:CDK1 complex was reported to phosphorylate CDC25B in late G2, targeting
  it for proteasome-mediated degradation, which is an important step for G2/M transition
  (Baldin et al. 1997). While CCNB1:CDK1 and CCNA2:CDK2 can also phosphorylate CDC25B,
  the phosphorylated residues likely differ for the three CDK2 complexes, based on
  differences in migration of phosphorylated CDC25B in denaturing polyacrylamide gels,
  and only CCNA2:CDK1-mediated phosphorylation leads to proteasomal degradation of
  CDC25B (Baldin et al. 1997). CDC25B (MPIP2) was also reproducibly identified as
  a target of the CCNA2:CDK1 complex in a high-throughput study (Dumitru et al. 2017).
