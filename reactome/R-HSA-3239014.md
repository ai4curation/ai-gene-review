display_name: MAPKAPK5 phosphorylates TP53
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated MAPKAPK5 (PRAK) phosphorylates TP53 (p53) on serine residue S37,
  thereby activating it. MAPKAPK5-mediated phosphorylation of TP53 promotes growth
  arrest and senescence induced by oncogenic RAS, but is not needed for TP53-dependent
  growth arrest in response to DNA damage (Sun et al. 2007).

## Summary

Activated MAPKAPK5 (PRAK) phosphorylates TP53 (p53) on serine residue S37, thereby activating it. MAPKAPK5-mediated phosphorylation of TP53 promotes growth arrest and senescence induced by oncogenic RAS, but is not needed for TP53-dependent growth arrest in response to DNA damage (Sun et al. 2007).
