stable_id: R-HSA-8956586
display_name: RUNX1-containing TAL1 complex binds the MYB gene enhancer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The TAL1 complex containing GATA3, RUNX1 and CBFB binds the MYB gene enhancer
  element (Sanda et al. 2012, Mansour et al. 2014). Binding of the RUNX1-containing
  TAL1 complex to the MYB gene enhancer can be facilitated by the presence of the
  MYB transcription factor (Mansour et al. 2014).
