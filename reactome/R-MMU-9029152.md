  mediates exchange of GDP for GTP bound to Ras
species: Mus musculus
summary: Sos1 and phospho-Vav1 bound to Grb2 in a complex with the activated Epor
  catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP bound to Ras proteins, yielding Ra:GTP. Ras:GTP
  then activates Raf1, Erk1 and Erk2 (Todokoro et al. 1994). Epo is observed to activate
  Kras, Nras, and Hras (Zhang and Lodish 2005). Kras appears to be especially important
  for erythropoiesis since deletion of Kras causes anemia (Khalaf et al. 2005, Zhang
  and Lodish 2005, Zhang and Lodish 2007).

## Summary

Sos1 and phospho-Vav1 bound to Grb2 in a complex with the activated Epor catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP bound to Ras proteins, yielding Ra:GTP. Ras:GTP then activates Raf1, Erk1 and Erk2 (Todokoro et al. 1994). Epo is observed to activate Kras, Nras, and Hras (Zhang and Lodish 2005). Kras appears to be especially important for erythropoiesis since deletion of Kras causes anemia (Khalaf et al. 2005, Zhang and Lodish 2005, Zhang and Lodish 2007).
