display_name: Src phosphorylate SYK in IgG:Leishmania surface:p-FCGR3A:SYK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Multiple sites of phosphorylation are known to exist in SYK, which both regulate
  its activity and also serve as docking sites for other proteins. Some of these sites
  include Y131 of interdomain A, Y323, Y348, and Y352 of interdomain B, and Y525 and
  Y526 within the activation loop of the kinase domain and Y630 in the C-terminus
  (Zhang et al. 2002, Lupher et al. 1998, Furlong et al. 1997). Phosphorylation of
  these tyrosine residues disrupts autoinhibitory interactions and results in kinase
  activation even in the absence of phosphorylated ITAM tyrosines (Tsang et al. 2008).
  SYK is primarily phosphorylated by Src family kinases and this acts as an initiating
  trigger by generating few molecules of activated SYK which are then involved in
  major SYK autophosphorylation (Hillal et al. 1997).
