display_name: PDCL binds G-protein beta and TRiC/CCT
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'PDCL (PhLP1), phosphorylated by the casein kinase II complex (CK2), simultaneously
  binds to the unfolded G-protein beta subunit and the TRiC/CCT chaperonin (Lukov
  et al. 2005, Lukov et al. 2006, Plimpton et al. 2015). Phosphorylation is not a
  prerequisite for PDCL binding to TRiC/CCT and the unfolded G-protein beta, but is
  necessary for PDCL-mediated release of folded G-protein beta from TRiC/CCT (Lukov
  et al. 2006). '

## Summary

PDCL (PhLP1), phosphorylated by the casein kinase II complex (CK2), simultaneously binds to the unfolded G-protein beta subunit and the TRiC/CCT chaperonin (Lukov et al. 2005, Lukov et al. 2006, Plimpton et al. 2015). Phosphorylation is not a prerequisite for PDCL binding to TRiC/CCT and the unfolded G-protein beta, but is necessary for PDCL-mediated release of folded G-protein beta from TRiC/CCT (Lukov et al. 2006).
