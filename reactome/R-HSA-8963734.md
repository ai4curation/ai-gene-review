display_name: IL9 binds IL9R:JAK1 and IL2RG:JAK3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-9 (IL9) binds to the Interleukin-9 receptor (IL9R) and Cytokine
  common gamma chain subunit (IL2RG) forming a ligand-receptor complex (Kimura et
  al 1995, Nizsal贸czki et al. 2014). IL2RG is essential for IL9 dependent growth signal
  transduction (Kimura et al. 1995). IL9R (glycoprotein of 64 kDa) has saturable and
  specific binding sites with a Kd of 100 pM (Renauld et al. 1992). IL9R colocalize
  with Interleukin-2 receptors and MHC molecules in lipid rafts of human T lymphoma
  cells so it is suggested that interactions within these membrane clusters could
  affect the assembly and signaling capability of the receptors (Nizsal贸czki et al.
  2014). Moreover, there is evidence that Tyrosine protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) cooperates
  with Tyrosine protein kinase JAK3 (JAK3) in signaling through IL2RG-containing receptors
  (Haan et al. 2011).
