stable_id: R-HSA-391913
display_name: FPR2 binds FPR2 ligands
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The N-formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2, LXA4 receptor, FPRL1) (Ye et al. 1992,
  Fiore et al. 1994) has been reported to respond to numerous ligand with a broad
  range of structural diversity (Migeotte et al. 2006). It was originally identified
  as a low-affinity receptor for N-formyl-methionyl peptides but has greater affinity
  for many ligands including lipoxin A4 (Fiore et al. 1994, Migeotte et al. 2006),
  annexin-1 (Perretti et al. 2002), the truncated chemokine sCKbeta8-1 (Elagoz et
  al. 2004) and humanin (Ying et al. 2004).
