species: Rattus norvegicus
summary: Intracellular proteins are targeted for proteolytic degradation in lysosome
  with the aid of chaperones. Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) transports
  substrates from the cytosol to the lysosomal membrane where it binds to Lysosome-associated
  membrane glycoprotein 2 (Lamp2). Subsequently, Lamp2 forms a multimeric complex
  and transfers the substrate into the lumen. The stability of this complex is regulated
  by the dynamics of Hspa8. Cytosolic Hspa8 binds with Lamp2 multimers in the lysosomal
  membrane. This induces the disassembly of the multimeric complex into monomeric
  units (Bandyopadhyay U et al. 2008).

Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) transports substrates from the cytosol to the lysosomal membrane where it binds to Lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2 (Lamp2). Subsequently, Lamp2 forms a multimeric complex and transfers the substrate into the lumen. The stability of this complex is regulated by the dynamics of Hspa8. Cytosolic Hspa8 binds with Lamp2 multimers in the lysosomal membrane. This induces the disassembly of the multimeric complex into monomeric units (Bandyopadhyay U et al. 2008).
