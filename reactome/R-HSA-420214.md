stable_id: R-HSA-420214
display_name: The adrenomedullin receptor can bind adrenomedullin and intermedin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Intermedin (AM2) (Roh J et al, 2004) and adrenomedullin (AM) (Kitamura K
  et al, 1993) belong to the calcitonin peptide hormone family and are important for
  cardiovascular and respiratory regulation. The functional adrenomedullin receptor
  AM1 is composed of the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CGPR) and receptor
  activity modifying protein 2 (RAMP2) (Kamitani S et al, 1999). AM1 receptor can
  bind either of these peptide hormones and its activity is mediated by coupling with
  the G protein alpha s subunit which stimulates adenylyl cyclase and increases intracellular
  cAMP levels (Aiyar N et al, 2001). The function of the AM2 receptor (formed by the
  combination of CGPR and RAMP3) is very similar to that of AM1.
