display_name: IQGAPs bind CALM1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IQGAP proteins IQGAP1, IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 possess IQ repeats (isoleucine-
  and glutamine-rich motifs) that bind CALM1 (calmodulin) in the presence of calcium
  ions (Atcheson et al. 2011, Andrews et al. 2012). IQGAP1 also binds the calmodulin-related
  proteins myosin essential light chain (MLCS1A) and S100B (Atcheson et al. 2011).
  Calmodulin binding inhibits the association of IQGAPs with the F-actin (Bashour
  et al. 1997, Pelikan-Conchaudron et al. 2011).
