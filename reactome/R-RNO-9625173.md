display_name: Unfolded substrate in Lamp2 multimeric complex binds Hspa8
species: Rattus norvegicus
summary: Intracellular proteins are targeted for proteolytic degradation in the lysosome
  with the aid of chaperones. Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) acts as the
  constitutive chaperone that binds a KFERQ-domain containing substrate in the cytosol
  and translocates to lysosomal membrane where it binds to Lysosome-associated membrane
  glycoprotein 2 (Lamp2). Subsequently, Hspa8 is released and Heat shock protein Hsp90
  binds to the lysosomal luminal end of Lamp2. The Lamp2 complex then multimerizes
  and stabilizes. Now, the substrate unfolds and binds to Hspa8 in the lysosomal lumen
  (Agarraberes FA et al. 1997, Cuervo AM et al. 1997). Subsequently, the substrate
  is internalized and degraded in the lumen.
