display_name: Activated TLR2/4 interacts with MAL (TIRAP)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TIRAP/Mal-deficient mice showed normal responses to the TLR3, TLR5, TLR7,
  and TLR9 ligands, but were defective in TLR4 and TLR2 ligand-induced proinflammatory
  cytokine production (Horng et al. 2002,Yamamoto et al. 2002). In contrast, TLR4
  ligand-induced activation of IRF-3 and expression of IFN-inducible genes were not
  impaired in TIRAP/Mal knockout macrophages or in mice lacking both MyD88 and TIRAP/Mal
  (Horng et al. 2002,Yamamoto et al. 2002). Thus, TIRAP/Mal is an essential adapter
  that is involved in the MyD88-dependent pathway via TLR4 and TLR2, but not in the
  MyD88-independent pathway. Mal contains a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding
  domain required for retention in the plasma membrane. The intracellular TIR domains
  of TLR2 or 4 associate with Mal at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane,
  which in turn facilitates the binding of MyD88 to the activated TLR, leading to
  NF-kB and MAPK activation [Nunez Miguel et al 2007].
