display_name: MMADHC targets transport of cytosolic cob(II)alamin to mitochondria
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MMADHC (Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type D protein) has sequence
  homology with a bacterial ATP binding cassette transporter and contains a putative
  cobalamin binding motif and a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence. It is required
  for cob(II)alamin (B<sub>12r</sub>) uptake by mitochondria (Stucki et al. 2012,
  Coelho et al. 2008), whereupon the complex of the two proteins dissociates, but
  the actual mechanism of transport into the mitochondrion is unknown (Banerjee et
  al. 2021).
