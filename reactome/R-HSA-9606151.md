stable_id: R-HSA-9606151
display_name: Phosphorylated BLNK (SLP65, in Antigen:p-BCR:p-SYK:p-BLNK:CIN85:GRB2:SOS1)
  binds BTK, PLCG2, VAV1, NCK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylated BLNK (also called BASH or SLP-65) at the plasma membrane recruits
  BTK, PLC gamma, VAV, GRB2, and NCK (Fu and Chan 1997, Fu et al. 1998, Wienands et
  al. 1998, Su et al. 1999, Baba et al. 2001, Chiu et al. 2002). The SH2 domain of
  BTK binds phosphorylated BLNK (Hashimoto et al. 1999, Su et al. 1999, Baba et al.
  2001). BLNK is constitutively bound to CIN85 and phosphorylated BLNK is bound to
  a large complex containing CIN85, SOS1, GRB2, phosphorylated SYK, and the B cell
  receptor.
