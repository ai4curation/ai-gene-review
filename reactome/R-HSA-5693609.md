display_name: ATM phosphorylates TP53 at S15
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In response to DNA double strand breaks, serine at position 15 of the TP53
  (p53) tumor suppressor protein is rapidly phosphorylated by the ATM kinase. This
  serves to stabilize the p53 protein. A rise in the levels of the p53 protein induces
  the expression of p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. This prevents the normal
  progression from G1 to S phase, thus providing a check on replication of damaged
  DNA (Banin et al. 1998, Canman et al. 1998, Khanna et al. 1998).

## Summary

In response to DNA double strand breaks, serine at position 15 of the TP53 (p53) tumor suppressor protein is rapidly phosphorylated by the ATM kinase. This serves to stabilize the p53 protein. A rise in the levels of the p53 protein induces the expression of p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. This prevents the normal progression from G1 to S phase, thus providing a check on replication of damaged DNA (Banin et al. 1998, Canman et al. 1998, Khanna et al. 1998).
