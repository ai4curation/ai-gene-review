display_name: The NEXT complex binds ZC3H4:WDR82:CBCA:m7GpppN-RNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ZC3H4:WDR82 complex (Austenaa et al. 2021, Estell et al. 2023) binds
  capped RNAs via an interaction between ZC3H4 and SRRT (ARS2) of the CBCA complex
  (CBP80:CBP20:ARS2, also called NCBP1:NCBP2:SRRT) at the 5' cap of the RNA (Rouvière
  et al. 2023, Estell et al. 2023). ZC3H4 also binds a homodimer of the NEXT complex
  (RBM7:ZCCHC8:MTREX, MTREX is also known as SKIV2L2 and MTR4) (Puno and Lima 2022,
  Gerlach et al. 2022), which interacts with the RNA exosome to degrade RNA (Rouvière
  et al. 2023, Estell et al. 2023).<br>ZC3H4 appears to target capped RNAs produced
  from transcripts that are terminated by the Terminator complex (ZC3H4:WDR82:SRRT)
  (Estell et al. 2023, reviewed in Rambout and Maquat 2024). Transcripts regulated
  by ZC3H4 include inefficiently spliced non-coding RNAs (Austemaa et al. 2021), antisense
  RNAs (Estell et al. 2021), and transcripts from enhancers (Estell et al. 2021).
  Substrate RNAs of NEXT are generally not polyadenylated, do not have polyadenylation
  sequences (Wu et al. 2020), and include promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTS)
  and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) (Lubas et al. 2015).
