summary: Optineurin (OPTN) is a multifunctional, ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein
  which exhibits a high homology with IKBKG (NEMO, the regulatory subunit of the IkB
  kinase complex). OPTN has been implicated in regulating of various signaling pathways
  including NF-kappa-B activation, TBK1-mediated type I interferon production, programmed
  cell death, and autophagy (reviewed in Markovinovic A et al. 2017; Slowicka K &
  van Loo G 2018; Toth RP & Atkin JD 2018). In human and mouse cells, OPTN was identified
  as a negative regulator of the tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced signaling
  pathway by targeting several downstream components including receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), caspase 8 (CASP8), and ubiquitin (Ub)
  carboxyl-terminal hydrolase CYLD (Zhu G et al. 2007; Nagabhushana A et al. 2011;
  Nakazawa S et al. 2016). Direct association of OPTN with TNFR1 and RIPK1 was detected
  in TNF-α-stimulated human epithelial carcinoma KB cells and HeLa cells by coimmunoprecipitation
  suggesting that OPTN is recruited to the TNFR1 complex (Zhu G et al. 2007; Klingseisen
  L et al. 2012; Nakazawa S et al. 2016). Structural and biochemical studies showed
  that OPTN functions through its ability to bind ubiquitinated proteins such as RIPK1,
  and the UBAN domain of OPTN preferentially recognizes linear polyUb chains (Gleason
  CE et al. 2011; Nakazawa S et al. 2016; Li F et al. 2018). Although the highest
  affinity is seen for M1-linked polyUb chains, TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of OPTN
  on S473 has been shown to broaden its specificity to include K63- and K48-linked
  polyUb chains (Li F et al. 2018). The Ub-binding activity of OPTN is thought to
  downregulate the TNF-α mediated NF-kappa-B activation (Zhu G et al. 2007; Maruyama
  H et al. 2010; Nakazawa S et al. 2016) by suppressing a scaffold function of RIPK1
  within the TNFR1 signaling complex (Zhu G et al. 2007; Nakazawa S et al. 2016).
  In addition, OPTN interacts with deubiquitinase CYLD, which acts as a negative regulator
  of the TNFR1-induced gene expression by hydrolyzing K63-, M1-linked polyUb chains
  of RIPK1. CoIP assay detected interaction of OPTN with CYLD upon co-expression of
  tagged proteins in HeLa cells (Nagabhushana A et al. 2011). Defective binding of
  the glaucoma-associated OPTN H486R variant to CYLD prevented CYLD-mediated inhibition
  of TNFα-induced NF-kappa-B activity upon co-expression of OPTN and CYLD in HeLa
  cells. A catalytically inactive CYLD variant co-immunoprecipitated polyUb-RIPK1
  along with OPTN in HeLa cells. Further, OPTN knockdown prevented RIPK1 deubiquitination
  by overexpressed CYLD in TNF-α-induced HeLa cells (Nagabhushana A et al. 2011).
  The data suggest that OPTN directly interacts with CYLD and RIPK1 to mediate deubiquitination
  of RIPK1 by CYLD within the TNFR1 signaling complex thus suppressing the NF-kappa-B
  signaling pathway. However, the OPTN regulatory function on NF-kappa-B signaling
  observed <i>in vitro</i> has not been confirmed <i>in vivo</i> suggesting that the
  mechanism of OPTN-mediated regulation is indirect and/or depends on the NF-kappa-B-mediated
  upregulation of OPTN (Sudhakar C et al. 2009; Gleason CE et al. 2011; Munitic I
  et al. 2013; Slowicka K et al. 2016; Markovinovic A et al. 2018).<p>Similar to mutations

  M719V has been shown to increase deubiquitinating activity of CYLD, leading to enhanced
