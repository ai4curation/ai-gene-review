species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'HIV-1 infection of target cells depends on the sequential interaction of
  the gp120 glycoprotein with the cellular CD4 receptor as well as members of the
  chemokine receptor family, such as CCR5.  Upon interaction with the cellular CD4
  receptor, gp120 undergoes a conformation change which allows interaction with these
  chemokine receptors to occur.  Studies indicate that upon binding to CD4, this conformational
  change results in a repositioning of  V1 and V2 loops of gp120, and  exposes or
  forms the "bridging sheet domain" epitopes, which are then available for co-receptor
  (chemokine receptor) binding along with other domains of gp120. These epitopes are
  recognized by 17b, a member of a class of antibodies that recognize CD4-induced
  (CD4i) epitopes (Kwong et al., 1998, Rizzuto et al., 1998, Zhang et al., 1999). '
