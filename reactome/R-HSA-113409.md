display_name: Abortive termination of early transcription elongation by DSIF:NELF
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the early elongation phase, shorter transcripts typically of ~30 nt in
  length are generated due to random termination of elongating nascent transcripts.
  This abortive cessation of elongation has been observed mainly in the presence of
  DSIF-NELF bound to Pol II complex.  (Reviewed in Conaway et al.,2000; Shilatifard
  et al., 2003 ).
