display_name: Chondroitin polymerase complex transfers GalNAc to CS chain
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The chondroitin polymerase complex transfers one GalNAc moiety from UDP-GalNAc
  to the CS chain. It consists of a heterodimer of CHSY1 or CHSY3 with CHPF2 or CHPF
  (Dutta et al., 2025; see also the review by Mikami & Kitagawa, 2013). They possess
  both beta-1,3-glucuronic acid and beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosamine transferase activity
  (Kitagawa et al. 2001, Yada et al. 2003, Yada et al. 2003b). Defects in CHSY1 cause
  Temtamy preaxial brachydactyly syndrome (TPBS) (MIM:605282) (Tian et al. 2010, Li
  et al. 2010).
