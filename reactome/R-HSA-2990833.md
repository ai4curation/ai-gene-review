display_name: Conjugation of SUMO1 to UBA2:SAE1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The UBA2:SAE1 complex catalyzes the formation of a thioester bond between
  SUMO1 and cysteine-173 of UBA2 (Desterro et al. 1999, Okuma et al. 1999, Werner
  et al. 2009, Olsen et al. 2010, Wang and Chen 2010). ATP reacts with the C-terminal
  glycine residue of SUMO1 to yield pyrophosphate and a transient intermediate, SUMO1
  adenylate, which then reacts with the thiol group of the cysteine residue on UBA2.
