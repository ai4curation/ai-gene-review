species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'WEE1-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of CDK1 (Cdc2) bound to either CCNA
  or CCNB was initially discovered using human CDK1, clam cyclin A or cyclin B, and
  wee1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Parker et al., 1991). The human WEE1 kinase
  was subsequently shown to phosphorylates CDK1 on tyrosine 15 (Y15), resulting in
  inactivation of the CCNB1:CDK1 complex (Watanabe et al., 1995). Two-dimensional
  gel electrophoresis of protein extracts of cycling human cells has shown that CDK1
  triple phosphorylated at T14, Y15, and T161 is the most abundant form of CDK1 that
  co-immunoprecipitates with CCNA2 or CCNB1, and Y15 phosphorylation of CDK1 was confirmed
  to be WEE1-dependent (Coulonval et al. 2011). WEE1 inhibition in G2 by a tyrosine
  kinase inhibitor MK-1775 decreases Y15 phosphorylation on CCNA2-bound CDK1 and CDK2
  and promotes the activity of CCNA2:CDK complexes (Gheghiani et al. 2017). '
