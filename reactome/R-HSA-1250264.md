stable_id: R-HSA-1250264
display_name: TXNIP binds reduced thioredoxin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TXNIP interacts with the redox-active domain of thioredoxin (TRX) and is
  believed to act as an oxidative stress mediator by inhibiting TRX activity or by
  limiting its bioavailability (Nishiyama et al. 1999, Liyanage et al. 2007).
