display_name: BTG2 binds CCR4-NOT complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BTG2, through its conserved BTG domain, binds catalytic subunits CNOT7 and
  CNOT8 of the CCR4-NOT complex and promotes mRNA deadenylation activity of the CCR4-NOT
  (Rouault et al. 1998, Mauxion et al. 2008, Doidge et al. 2012). The interaction
  with the CCR4-NOT is needed for the antiproliferative activity of BTG2 (Horiuchi
  et al. 2009, Doidge et al. 2012, Ezzeddine et al. 2012).
