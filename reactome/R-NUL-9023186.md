display_name: Carboxypeptidase E (rat Carboxypeptidase H) cleaves C-peptide (Insulin(57-89))
  to yield C-peptide (Insulin(57-87))
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Carboxypeptidase E (also called Carboxypeptidase H) purified from rat beta
  cells cleaves the C-terminal two amino acid residues (arginine-89 and lysine-88)
  from the C-peptide derived from human proinsulin (Davidson and Hutton 1987).
