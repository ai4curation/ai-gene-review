summary: 'TNF-α-induced signaling by TNFR1 promotes the activation of sphingomyelin
  phosphodiesterase  (sphingomyelinase or SMASE) signaling pathways. SMASE is a family
  of an agonist-activated effector enzymes that hydrolyze phospholipids on the membrane

  with neutral sphingomyelinase activation (FAN or NSMAF) is an adaptor protein that
  constitutively binds to the neutral SMASE activation domain (NSD) of TNFR1 (Adam-Klages
  S et al. 1996). NSMAF (FAN) is thought to directly link TNFR1 to the activation
  of neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMASE) such as sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 2
  or 3 (SMPD2, SMPD3). '
