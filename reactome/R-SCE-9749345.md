stable_id: R-SCE-9749345
display_name: CDT1-mediated loading of MCM2-7 to replication origin in budding yeast
species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
summary: Based on yeast studies, CDT1 binding to the MCM2-7 complex induces a structural
  change in the MCM2-7 that relieves MCM2-7 autoinhibition by the C-terminus of its
  MCM6 subunit, enabling a direct association between MCM2-7 and CDC6 bound to the
  ORC(1-6) complex at the replication origin (Fernández-Cid et al. 2013). As a result,
  the OCCM complex is formed, which contains ORC(1-6), CDC6, CDT1 and MCM2-7 bound
  to the replication origin (Fernández-Cid et al. 2013, Sun et al. 2013).
