display_name: FLIP(S) and procaspase-8 form heterodimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The short form of cellular FLIP (FLIP(S) or c-FLIPS) has two death effector
  domains DEDs, which can bind to FADD and caspase-8 (CASP8). FLIP(S) protects the
  cells from apoptosis by inhibiting the processing of caspase-8 at the receptor level
  (Scaffidi C et al. 1999; Micheau O et al 2001).<p>FLIP(S) is a short-lived protein
  which is sensitive to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Poukkula M et
  al. 2005). Protein kinase C (PKC)- mediated phosphorylation of FLIP(S) at Ser193
  was shown to prolongs the half-life of FLIP(S) by inhibiting its polyubiquitination
  (Kaunisto A et al. 2009).
