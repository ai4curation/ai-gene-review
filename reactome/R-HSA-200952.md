stable_id: R-HSA-200952
display_name: Nef binds a ternary complex comprising DOCK2 guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor for small Rho-family GTPase Rac, its cofactor ELMO1, and Rac, and activates
  Rac through this interaction
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The infectious cycle of primate lentiviruses is intimately linked to interactions
  between cells of the immune system. Nef, a potent virulence factor, alters cellular
  environments to increase lentiviral replication in the host,  functioning as an
  adaptor protein. Nef activates Rac in T cell lines and in primary T cells following
  infection with HIV-1 in the absence of antigenic stimuli. Nef activates Rac by binding
  the DOCK2-ELMO1 complex, and this interaction is linked to the abilities of Nef
  to inhibit chemotaxis and promote T cell activation. Nef targets a critical switch
  that regulates Rac GTPases downstream of chemokine- and antigen-initiated signaling
  pathways. This interaction enables Nef to influence multiple aspects of T cell function
  and thus provides an important mechanism by which Nef impacts pathogenesis by primate
  lentiviruses.
