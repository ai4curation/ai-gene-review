species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Advanced glycosylation end product specific receptor (AGER) also known as
  Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand membrane receptor
  belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It recognizes a large variety of modified
  proteins known as advanced glycation/glycosylation endproducts (AGEs) a heterogenous
  group of structures (Ikeda et al. 1996) that accumulate in patients with diabetes,
  atherosclerosis, renal failure or ageing (Schmidt et al. 1999). The most prevalent
  class of AGE in vivo are N(6)-carboxymethyllysine (NECML) adducts (Kislinger et
  al. 1991). AGER is a receptor for amyloid-beta peptide (Ab)(Yan et al. 1996), mediating
  Ab neurotoxicity and promoting Ab influx into the brain (Zhang et al. 2009). AGER
  also responds to the proinflammatory S100/calgranulins (Hofmann et al. 1999) and
  High mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1/Amphoterin/DEF)  (Hori et al. 1995). The major
  pathway is NFkappaB activation, but AGER can also activate rho-GTPases and thereby
  MAPK and JNK cascades. (Bierhaus et al. 2005). '
