species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mitochondrial mRNAs contain polyadenylation, pseudouridylation, and N1-adenosine
  methylation, posttranscriptional modifications that are catalyzed by proteins encoded
  in the nucleus (reviewed in Chrzanowska-Lightowlers and Lightowlers 2024). <br>Polyadenylation
  at the 3' ends of mitochondrial mRNAs is produced by MTPAP (also called PAPD1),
  a dimeric polyadenylate polymerase located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial
  matrix (Nagaike et al. 2005, Slomovic and Schuster 2008, Bai et al. 2011, Wilson
  et al. 2014, reviewed in Chang and Tong 2012). Like the polyadenylate tails of cytoplasmic
  mRNAs, the mitochondrial polyadenylate tails appear to stabilize the mRNAs (Nagaike
  et al. 2005), however, mitochondrial polyadenylate tails (~40-50 adenylate residues)
  are shorter than those observed in the cytosol (~250 adenylate residues) (reviewed
  in Boreikaitė and Passmore 2023). MTPAP may also catalyze polyuridylation. <br>Pseudouridylation
  in mitochondria is catalyzed by a large protein complex, the mitochondrial pseudouridylation
  module, that contains the pseudouridine synthases RPUSD3, RPUSD4, and TRUB2 (Arroyo
  et al. 2016, Antonicka et al. 2017). RPUSD4 pseudouridylates rRNA and tRNA while
  either RPUSD3 or TRUB2 are capable of pseudouridylating uridine-390 of MT-CO1 mRNA
  and uridine-697 of MT-CO3 mRNA (Carlile et al. 2019, Antonicka et al. 2017). Depletion
  of either RPUSD3 or TRUB2 caused a reduction in mitochondrial translation (Antonicka
  et al. 2017). <br>In mitochondria, methylation of the N1 position of adenosine residues
  in mRNAs is catalyzed by the methyltransferase TRMT61B, which methylates adenosine
  residues in the MT-ND1, MT-CO1, MT-CO2, MT-CO3, MT-ND4L, and MT-CYB mRNAs (Li et
  al. 2017). N1-methyladenosine in mitochondrial mRNAs causes ribosome stalling and
  reduced translation (Li et al. 2017).
