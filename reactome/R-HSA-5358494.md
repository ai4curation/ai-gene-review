  715 of nascent EEF2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The diphthamide biosynthesis protein 2 (DPH2) subunit of the cytosolic DPH1:DPH2:DPH3
  complex catalyzes the transfer of a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl group from S-adenosylmethionine
  (AdoMet) to residue 715 of nascent elongation factor 2 (EEF2), forming aminocarboxypropyl
  EEF2 and S-methylthioadenosine (MTAD). The association of DPH1, 2, and 3 to form
  a complex is inferred from studies of the homologous yeast proteins (Abdel-Fattah
  et al. 2013; Bar et al. 2008) and more limited studies of interactions among mouse
  and human ones (Liu et al. 2004). The identification of DPH2 as the catalytically
  active subunit of the DPH1:DPH2:DPH3 complex is inferred from the properties of
  the homologous Pyrococcus horikoshii protein (Zhang et al. 2010). DPH4 (DNAJC24)
  is needed for the reaction to occur but its exact role is unknown (Liu et al. 2004;
  Su et al. 2013). DPH3 is an electron donor for DPH1-DPH2 in the first step of diphthamide
  biosynthesis (Dong et al. 2014).
