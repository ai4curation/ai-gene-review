# RhoGTPase GEF's recruited to DCC
**Reactome ID:** [R-HSA-418858](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-418858)
**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

When Netrin-1 binds to the DCC-NCK1 complex, a conformational change in NCK1 promotes interaction between the SH2 domain proteins, leading to recruitment and activation of RhoGEFs DOCK180 and Trio. These GEFs mediate Netrin-1 signaling in axon outgrowth and guidance through their ability to activate Rac1 and Cdc42.
