display_name: Cytosolic FGFR1 fusion proteins bind PIK3R1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activation of the PI3K signaling pathway has been demonstrated for a number
  of FGFR1 fusion proteins and inhibitors of this pathway impair the proliferative
  and survival function of the fusions (Guasch, 2001; Demiroglu, 2001;  Chen, 2004;
  Lelievre, 2008).  FGFR1 fusions lack the FRS2-binding site of the full length protein,
  so the mechanism of PI3K recruitment is unclear.  Unlike BCR-FGFR1, which has been
  shown to recruit GRB2 through the BCR Y177 site, GRB2 did not co-precipitate with
  the ZMYM2-FGFR1 fusion (Roumianetsev, 2004).  In the case of FOP-FGFR1, Y730 has
  been shown to be required for the recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI3K; however,
  CEP110-FGFR1, which contains Y730 in the context of the same pYXXM motif, was not
  shown to recruit p85 at the centrosome (Guasch, 2001).
