stable_id: R-HSA-8936068
display_name: H19 is cleaved to produce miR-675
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19, frequently overexpressed in gastric cancer,
  functions as a precursor (pri-microRNA) in the production of microRNA miR-675 (Cai
  and Cullen 2007), which targets and downregulates RUNX1 mRNA, thus interfering with
  RUNX1 transcription (Zhuang et al. 2014).
