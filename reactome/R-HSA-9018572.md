display_name: EGFR phosphorylates NOTCH3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: EGFR phosphorylates intracellular domain of NOTCH3 (NICD3) on an unknown
  tyrosine residue. EGFR signaling inhibits NICD3-mediated transcription. It is not
  known whether EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of NICD3 affects NICD3 nuclear translocation
  or the formation of the NOTCH3 coactivator complex. Erlotinib treatment, which inhibits
  EGFR activation, results in increased NOTCH3 signaling and induction of stem-like
  phenotype in treated cells (Arasada et al. 2014).
