display_name: CLPXP binds mitochondrial matrix proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The CLPXP complex is an ATP-dependent protease located in the mitochondrial
  matrix that binds, unfolds, and degrades a specific set of protein substrates. The
  CLPXP complex comprises two heptameric rings of CLPP protease subunits and two hexameric
  rings of CLPX ATPase subunits (Kang et al. 2002, 2005). Upon binding the CLPXP complex,
  substrate proteins are unfolded by CLPX in an ATP-dependent reaction and translocated
  to the CLPP protease (reviewed in Baker and Sauer 2012, Liu et al. 2014). The CLPXP
  complex interacts with more than 200 mitochondrial proteins (Cole et al. 2015, Ishizawa
  et al. 2019, Mabanglo et al. 2022) and degrades several mitochondrial matrix proteins
  (Lee et al. 2021, Key et al. 2021), including ERAL1, a putative 12S rRNA chaperone
  (inferred from mouse homologs in Szczepanowska et al. 2016, Key et al. 2022) and
  heme-bound ALAS1 (Kubota et al. 2016, Nomura et al. 2021). CLPXP can also regulate
  proteins involved in bioenergetics such as components of the electron transport
  chain suggesting that it can regulate proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane
  (Seo et al. 2016, Ishizawa et al. 2019, Mabanglo et al. 2022). CLPXP is also thought
  to be involved in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (inferred from C.
  elegans homologs in Haynes et al. 2007 and mouse homologs in Lian et al. 2023).
