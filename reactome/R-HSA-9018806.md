## Summary

The following GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) were shown to bind RAC3 and stimulate its GTPase activity, resulting in GTP to GDP hydrolysis and conversion of the active RAC3:GTP complex into the inactive RAC3:GDP complex (the high throughput screen by Bagci et al. 2020, cited as supporting evidence, examined binding of GAPs to constitutively active RAC3 mutant without looking at activation of the RAC3 GTPase activity):<br>ARHGAP1 (Amin et al. 2016; supported by Bagci et al. 2020)<br>ARHGAP6 (Li et al. 2016)<br>ARHGAP15 (Zamboni et al. 2016)<br>ARHGAP26 (Amin et al. 2016)<br>ARHGAP35 (Amin et al. 2016; supported by Bagci et al. 2020)<br>RACGAP1 (Amin et al. 2016; supported by Bagci et al. 2020)<br><br>The following GAPs, annotated as candidate RAC3 GAPs, were shown to bind RAC3 and stimulate its GTPase activity in some but not all studies or were shown to bind to the constitutively active RAC3 mutant without testing for activation of RAC3 GTPase activity, as indicated:<br>ABR (Amin et al. 2016: RAC3 directed GAP activity; Bagci et al. 2020: no binding to active RAC3)<br>ARAP2 (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3)<br>ARAP3 (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3)<br>ARHGAP5 (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3)<br>ARHGAP17 (Amin et al. 2016: RAC3 directed GAP activity; Bagci et al. 2020: no binding to active RAC3)<br>ARHGAP21 (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3)<br>ARHGAP32 (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3)<br>ARHGAP39 (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3)<br>ARHGAP42 (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3)<br>BCR (Haataja et al. 1997: RAC3 directed GAP activity; Bagci et al. 2020: no binding to active RAC3)<br>DEPDC1B (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3)<br>OCRL (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3; Erdmann et al. 2007; Lichter Konecki et al. 2006: no RAC3 directed GAP activity:)<br>OPHN1 (Amin et al. 2016: RAC3 directed GAP activity; Bagci et al. 2020: no binding to active RAC3)<br>PIK3R1 (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3)<br>PIK3R2 (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3)<br>SRGAP2 (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3)<br>SYDE1 (Bagci et al. 2020: binding to active RAC3)<br><br>The following GAPs have been shown to not act on RAC3 or were shown to not bind to the constitutively active RAC3 mutant by Bagci et al. 2020:<br>ARHGAP12 (Bagci et al. 2020)<br>ARHGAP29 (Bagci et al. 2020)<br>ARHGAP31 (Bagci et al. 2020)<br>DLC1 (Amin et al. 2016)<br>MYO9A (Bagci et al. 2020)<br>MYO9B (Bagci et al. 2020)<br>STARD13 (Amin et al. 2016)<br>STARD8 (Amin et al. 2016)
