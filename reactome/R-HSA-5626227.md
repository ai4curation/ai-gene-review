display_name: CP110 and CEP97 dissociate from the centriole
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CCP110 is a negative regulator of ciliogenesis that caps the mother centriole.
  CCP110 may inhibit ciliogenesis in part by preventing the CEP290-dependent recruitment
  of RAB8A to the centrosome and cilia (Spektor et al, 2007; Tsang et al, 2008; reviewed
  in Tsang and Dynlacht, 2013). CCP110 and CEP97 also form a complex with the KIF24,
  a kinesin with centriolar microtubule depolymerizing activity that is required for
  the initial recruitment and/or stability of CCP110 at the centriole (Kobayashi et
  al, 2011). Recruitment of TTBK2 promotes the displacement of CCP110 and its binding
  partner CEP97. This results in the formation of a basal body and promotes recruitment
  of IFT complex members and allows axonemal extension to occur (Goetz et al, 2012;
  Ye et al, 2014; reviewed in Tsang and Dynlacht, 2013). Although the kinase activity
  of TTBK2 is required for cilium formation and TTBK2 has been shown to phosphorylate
  CEP164, the relevant physiological target during ciliogenesis has not been unambiguously
  identified (Cajanek et al, 2014). Similarly, the kinase activity of MARK4 is also
  required for ciliogenesis, and the interaction between MARK4 and ODF2, a putative
  substrate, is needed to promote the dissociation of the CCP110 and CEP97 proteins
  from the centriole (Kuhns et al, 2013; reviewed in Kim and Dynlacht, 2013).
