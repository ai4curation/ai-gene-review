display_name: CDH1-associated CTNNA1 binds VCL
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Vinculin (VCL) was first shown to be recruited to the CDH1 complex through
  its interaction with CTNNA1 (alpha-catenin) in human colon carcinoma cell line (Watabe-Uchida
  et al. 1998). Based on high resolution microscopy experiments in canine MDCK cell
  line, vinculin (VCL) is recruited to the CDH1 (E-cadherin) complex through simultaneous
  interaction with CTNNA1 and CTNNB1 (Bertocchi et al. 2017; Morales-Camilo et al.
  2024; reviewed in Zhang et al. 2023). Mechanical force-induced conformational change
  of CTNNA1 is thought to expose VCL binding sites (Bertocchi et al. 2017). The initial
  interaction with CTNNA1 is needed to induce a conformational change of VCL into
  a more open conformation, which then enables its interaction with CTNNB1 (Morales-Camilo
  et al. 2024). VCL may stabilize the interaction between CTNNA1 and F-actin (Mangeol
  et al. 2024). In human intestinal cells, vinculin was shown to be simultaneously
  associated with the CDH1 complex and with the nectin-afadin complex at the adherens
  junctions, possibly through ponsin, which is known to interact with both VCL and
  afadin (Mangeol et al. 2024).
