summary: 'Glycoprotein N acetylgalactosamine 3 beta galactosyltransferase 1 (C1GALT1;
  MIM:610555) mediates the transfer of Galactose (Gal) from UDP galactose to single
  O-linked GalNAc residues (Tn antigens) to form Core 1 structures on glycoproteins.
  C1GALT1 is active when in complex with the molecular chaperone C1GALT1C1 (aka COSMC;
  MIM:300611) which assists the folding and/or stability of C1GALT1. Defects in C1GALT1C1
  causes somatic Tn polyagglutination syndrome (TNPS; MIM:300622), characterised by
  the polyagglutination of erythrocytes by naturally occurring anti Tn antibodies
  following exposure of the Tn antigen on their surface. Defects in C1GALT1C1 render
  C1GALT1 inactive and results in the accumulation of the incompletely glycosylated
  Tn antigen. The Tn antigen is tumour associated, found in a majority of human carcinomas,
  and is not normally expressed in peripheral tissues or blood cells (Crew et al.

## Summary

Glycoprotein N acetylgalactosamine 3 beta galactosyltransferase 1 (C1GALT1; MIM:610555) mediates the transfer of Galactose (Gal) from UDP galactose to single O-linked GalNAc residues (Tn antigens) to form Core 1 structures on glycoproteins. C1GALT1 is active when in complex with the molecular chaperone C1GALT1C1 (aka COSMC; MIM:300611) which assists the folding and/or stability of C1GALT1.
