display_name: NOTCH3 coactivator complex binds WWC1 (Kibra) gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The WWC1 (Kibra) gene promoter region contains two RBPJ-binding sites, one
  on the sense strand and one on the antisense strand. The NOTCH3 coactivator complex
  binds to the RBPJ-binding site on the antisense strand (Zhang et al. 2016).
