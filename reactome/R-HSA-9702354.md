display_name: CALCA(83-119) binds CALCA antibodies
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The sensory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide 1 (CALCA(83-119),
  aka CGRP) plays an important role in primary headaches. Monoclonal antibodies against
  CALCA(83-119) are effective in migraine treatment (Edvinsson 2018). Humanised IgG
  monoclonal antibodies such as fremanezumab (TEV-48125) (Bigal et al. 2015, Silberstein
  et al. 2017), galcanezumab (LY2951742) (Skljarevski et al. 2018, Spindler & Ryan
  2020) and eptinezumab (Dodick et al. 2014, Dhillon 2020) have been developed as
  alternatives to CALCR antagonists (such as telcagepant). They show they can effectively
  reduce migraine headache and inhibit neurogenic vasodilation in humans. These antibodies
  have the advantage of longer half-lives compared to small molecule antagonists and
  fewer toxic side-effects.
