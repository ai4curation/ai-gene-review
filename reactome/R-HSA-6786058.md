display_name: JAK1 binds IL4R in IL4-bound IL4R1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In human blood monocytes, where the type I interleukin-4 (IL4) receptor (IL4R1)
  is the predominant IL4 receptor type, IL4 leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus
  kinase 1 (JAK1), rather than constitutively bound JAK2, JAK3 or Non-receptor associated
  tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). JAK1 was found to be essential for IL4-mediated expression
  of 15-lipoxygenase while JAK2 and TYK2 antisense inhibition had no effect (Bhattacharjee
  et al. 2013). As JAK1 binds IL4RA in response to IL13 binding (Roy et al. 2002),
  it is believed that IL4 similarly triggers binding of JAK1 to IL4 receptor complexes.
  The molecular trigger for JAK1 binding is not clear.

The molecular trigger for JAK1 binding is not clear.
