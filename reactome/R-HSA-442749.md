stable_id: R-HSA-442749
display_name: CaMKK autophosphorylates in the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Both isoforms of CaMKK, CAMKK1 (CaMKK-alpha) and CAMKK2 (CaMKK-beta) are
  fully activated upon autophosphorylation, which, under physiological conditions,
  takes places after binding to the Ca2+/calmodulin complex (CALM1:4xCa2+) (Okuno
  et al. 1997, Yamamori et al. 2004). While several autophosphorylation sites in both
  CAMKK1 and CAMKK2 have been reported, it is not clear whether these sites are calmodulin-dependent
  and physiologically relevant (Tokumitsu et al. 2011, Scott et al. 2015). CAMKK1
  is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of S74 and T108 by PKA. Constitutive
  phosphorylation of CAMKK2 by GSK3B and CDK5 may be required to prevent calmodulin-independent
  phosphorylation (Green et al. 2011). Once activated, CaMKK phosphorylates CaMKIV
  in a Ca2+/Calmodulin dependent manner (Yamamori et al. 2004). Because of uncertain
  localization of CaMKKs (Nakamura et al. 1996, Sakagami et al. 2000, Nakamura et
  al. 2001, Kitani et al. 2003), CaMKK autophosphorylation may occur in the nucleus,
  or in the cytosol, or in both cellular compartments.
