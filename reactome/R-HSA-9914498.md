display_name: POLG in the replisome polymerizes the L strand
species: Homo sapiens
summary: POLG:POLG2 (POLgamma) initiates polymerization of L strand DNA at the 3'
  hydroxyl group of an RNA primer produced by POLRMT (Wanrooij et al. 2008). Cleavage
  of the RNA primer by RNASEH1 is evidently not required (Wanrooij et al. 2008), unlike
  the case of the RNA primer for synthesis of the H strand. The template strand, the
  parental H strand, is already single-stranded and bound to tetramers of SSBP1, therefore
  the DNA helicase TWNK (PEO1) is not believed to be required for synthesis of the
  L strand.
