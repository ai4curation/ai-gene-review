display_name: Interaction of SHP1 and KIT
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 negatively regulates KIT signaling
  through binding to phosphorylated Y570. It is unclear whether SHP1 directly dephosphorylates
  KIT or elicits dephosphorylation of the receptor indirectly by dephosphorylating
  and inhibiting cytosolic PTKs that act on KIT. SHP-1 may also compete with and displace
  SFKs or other proteins that dock to phosphorylated Y570 (Kozlowski et al, 1998).
