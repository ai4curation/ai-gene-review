summary: Upon peptide binding the class I MHC molecule releases from the peptide loading
  complex (PLC) and clusters at  ER exit sites and is finally exported to the cell
  surface.<br>MHC I molecules bound to low-affinity peptides are not transferred to
  the cell surface and are instead cycled back to ER. They can proceed to the cell
  surface only when they become bound to high-affinity peptide (Howe et al. 2009,
  Garstka et al. 2007). Calreticulin binds to these low-affinity peptide bound class
  I molecules and mediate the retrieval from golgi apparatus to ER and for effcient
  presentation of a model antigen (Howe et al. 2009).
