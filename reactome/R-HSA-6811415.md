display_name: RAB:GTP recruits GBF1 to the Golgi membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In its GTP-bound active state, RAB1 recruits the ARF GEF GBF1 to the Golgi
  (Monetta et al, 2007). GBF is the only ARF activator required for the formation
  of COPI coats, and therefore it has roles in the anterograde ERGIC-to-cis-Golgi
  as well as in COPI-mediated retrograd transport within the Golgi and back to the
  ERGIC and ER (Kawamoto et al, 2002; Szul et al, 2005; Zhao et al, 2006; Szul et
  al, 2007; reviewed in Szul and Sztul, 2011).  GBR1 activates ARF1, 2, 3 and 5 which
  play overlapping roles in the secretory pathway (Volpicelli-Daley et al, 2005; Chun
  et al, 2008; reviewed in D'Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006).
