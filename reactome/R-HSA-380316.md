display_name: Association of NuMA with microtubules
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NuMA can interact with microtubules by direct binding to tubulin. Binding
  occurs through amino acids 1868-1967 of human NuMA (tail IIA) and appears to play
  a role in the organization of the spindle poles by stably crosslinking microtubule
  fibers (Haren and Merdes 2002). While the exact mechanism of microtubule bundling
  is not known, NuMA has been shown to form large fibrous networks (Saredi et al.
  1996, Gueth-Hallonet et al.1998, Harborth et al.1999) apparently as a result of
  dimerization of the NuMA rod domains followed by association of multiple NuMA dimers
  through their tail domains.
