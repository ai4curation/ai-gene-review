display_name: SRGAP2 stimulates RAC1 GTP-ase activity and ends FMNL1-mediated elongation
  of actin filaments
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SRGAP2 is a GTPase activating protein that stimulates the GTPase activity
  of RAC1 bound to FMNL1. GTP hydrolysis produces inactive GDP-bound RAC1 which is
  unable to bind and activate FMNL1. SRGAP2 thereby limits the duration of FMNL1-mediated
  elongation of actin filaments downstream of RAC1:GTP (Mason et al. 2011).

## Summary

SRGAP2 is a GTPase activating protein that stimulates the GTPase activity of RAC1 bound to FMNL1. GTP hydrolysis produces inactive GDP-bound RAC1 which is unable to bind and activate FMNL1. SRGAP2 thereby limits the duration of FMNL1-mediated elongation of actin filaments downstream of RAC1:GTP (Mason et al. 2011).
