display_name: gamma-secretase cleaves EPHB2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: EPHB2-C-terminal fragment1 (CTF1) is subsequently cleaved within the transmembrane
  domain between residues 569 and 570 (mouse EPHB2) by gamma-secretase to release
  a shorter cytosolic fragment containing 425 C-terminal amino acids. The EPHB2 cleavage
  products EPHB2-CTF1 and EPHB2-CTF2 may enhance the duration of full length EPHB2
  phosphorylation. These fragments lack the ephrin (EFN)-binding domain, but retain
  the entire cytoplasmic portion of the receptor, and may sequester phosphatases from
  full-length EPHB2 receptor, thus preventing its dephosphorylation (Litterst et al.
  2007).
