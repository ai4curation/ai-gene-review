species: Homo sapiens
summary: The bioactive prostaglandin (PG) signalling molecules, including PGA2, PGE2,
  PGF2a, and PGI2 (prostacyclin) are synthesised from arachidonate and its products
  by various prostaglandin synthase type enzymes. Prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) is the starting
  point for the synthesis of Thromboxanes (TXs) (Buczynski et al. 2009, Vance & Vance
  2008). PGs and TXs are collectively known as the prostanoids.<br>Two enzymes, PTGS1
  and 2 (COX1 and 2) both catalyze the two-step conversion of arachidonate to PGH2.
  PTGS1 is constitutively expressed in many cell types while PTGS2 is induced in response
  to stress and mediates the syntheses of prostaglandins associated with pain, fever,
  and inflammation. Aspirin irreversibly inactivates both enzymes (though it acts
  more efficiently on PTGS1), explaining both its antiinflammatory effects and side
  effects like perturbed gastic acid secretion. Drugs like celecoxib, by specifically
  inhibiting PTGS2, have a strong anti-inflammatory effect with fewer side effects.
  These PTGS2-specific drugs, however, probably because of their effects on the balance
  of prostaglandin synthesis in platelets and endothelial cells, can also promote
  blood clot formation (Buczynski et al. 2009; Stables & Gilroy 2011).
