summary: Activated MAP2Ks in complex with IL17RD phosphorylate MAPKs at the Golgi
  membrane.  IL17RD prevents the dissociation of phosphorylated MAPK from the complex
  at the Golgi as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation, preventing MAPK nuclear translocation
  and activation of nuclear targets (Torii et al, 2004; reviewed in Philips, 2004;

## Summary

Activated MAP2Ks in complex with IL17RD phosphorylate MAPKs at the Golgi membrane.  IL17RD prevents the dissociation of phosphorylated MAPK from the complex at the Golgi as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation, preventing MAPK nuclear translocation and activation of nuclear targets (Torii et al, 2004; reviewed in Philips, 2004; Brown and Sacks, 2009).
