display_name: Translocation of Influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1A) into
  the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1A) is a multifunctional protein
  that exists as a dimer and is involved in the inhibition of host cell antiviral
  pre-mRNA processing and counteracts host cell antiviral responses. Unlike most other
  RNA viruses, influenza viruses replicate in the nucleus of the host cells. NS1A
  protein carries two nuclear localization signal (NLS) elements and these sequence
  elements are recognized by importin-alpha/beta. In the cytoplasm NS1A binds to importin-alpha/beta
  and these protein complexes are then translocated into the nucleus through the nuclear
  pore complex (NPC).

  Note:Reactions directly involving interactions of human host proteins with foreign
  ones are highlighted in red.'
