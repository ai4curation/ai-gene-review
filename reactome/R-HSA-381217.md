display_name: IRE1:BiP dissociates in response to unfolded protein
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IRE1-alpha is a single-pass transmembrane protein with a luminal N-terminus
  and a cytoplasmic C-terminus. IRE1-alpha is maintained in an inactive state in the
  Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) membrane by interaction between the luminal domain of
  IRE1-alpha and the ATPase domain of BiP within the ER. <br>BiP is a general chaperone
  that also binds unfolded proteins within the ER. Thus BiP dissociates from IRE1-alpha
  when chaperone activity is overwhelmed by unfolded proteins in the ER.
