stable_id: R-HSA-9625482
display_name: PTK2 binds activated EGFR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PTK2 (also known as FAK, focal adhesion kinase) binds to the activated EGFR
  receptor as assessed by affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation (Sieg
  et al, 2000; Thelemann et al, 2005; Liu et al, 2010). Stimulation of the EGFR pathway
  increases PTK2 phosphorylation at Y397, and FAK phosphorylation contributes to cell
  migration and tumorigenicity (Tamura et al, 1998; Gu et al, 1999; Sieg et al, 2000;
  Liu et al, 2010; reviewed in Zhu et al, 2018). PTK2-stimulated cell motility depends
  on integrins and is transduced through phosphorylated MAPK3 and MAPK1 (also known
  as ERK1 and ERK2) (Sieg et al, 2000; Thelemann et al, 2000; Liu et al, 2005).
