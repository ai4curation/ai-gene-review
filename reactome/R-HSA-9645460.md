summary: 'Immune recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by
  pattern recognition receptors (PRR) often activates proinflammatory nuclear factor
  kappa B (NF-κB) signalling. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a well-known PAMP produced
  by gram-negative bacteria. LPS is recognized by toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) and
  is a strong activator of NF-κB inflammatory responses (Akashi S et al. 2003). LPS
  is also recognized in the cytosol by mouse caspase-11 and related human caspase-4
  and caspase-5, which stimulate pyroptosis, a proinflammatory form of cell death
  (Kayagaki N et al. 2011; Shi J et al. 2015). Key metabolic intermediates in LPS
  biosynthesis, d-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate (HBP) and ADP L-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose
  (ADP-heptose) were reported to activate the NF-κB pathway and trigger the innate
  immune responses (Milivojevic M et al. 2017; Zimmermann S et al. 2017; Zhou P et
  al. 2018; García-Weber D; 2018). ADP-heptose but not HBP can enter host cells autonomously
  (Zhou P et al. 2018). During infection, ADP-heptose or HBP translocate into the
  host cytosol where their presence is sensed by alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1) (Zimmermann
  S et al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018). ADP-heptose directly binds and activates ALPK1
  (Garcia-Weber D et al. 2018; Zhou P et al. 2018); instead, HBP is converted by host-derived
  adenylyltransferases, such as nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferases, to ADP-heptose
  7-P, a substrate which can then activate ALPK1 (Zhou P et al. 2018). The ADP-heptose
  binding to ALPK1 is thought to trigger conformational changes and stimulate the
  kinase domain of ALPK1 (Zhou P et al. 2018). ALPK1 kinase activity in turn leads
  to the phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α)
  receptor–associated factor (TRAF)–interacting protein with the forkhead-associated
  domain (TIFA) (Zimmermann S et al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018). This process activates
  TRAF6 oligomerization and ubiquitination, and the recruitment of transforming growth
  factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein 2 (TAB2), a component of the
  TAK1 (MAP3K7) complex (Ea CK et al. 2004; Gaudet RG et al. 2017). This TIFA oligomer
  signaling platform was given the term: TIFAsome. TIFAsome-activated TAK1 induces
  NF-κB nuclear translocation and proinflammatory gene expression. The ALPK1-TIFA
  signaling pathway has been identified in human embryonic kidney cells, intestinal
  epithelial cells, gastric cells and cervical cancer cells (Gaudet RG et al. 2015,
  2017; Stein SC et al. 2017; Gall A et al. 2017; Zimmermann S et al. 2017; Milivojevic
  M et al. 2017; Zhou P et al. 2018). In vivo studies demonstrate that ADP-heptose
  and Burkholderia cenocepacia trigger massive inflammatory responses with increased
  production of several NF-κB-dependent cytokines and chemokines in wild type (WT),

## Summary

Immune recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) often activates proinflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signalling.
