display_name: POLD,POLE complete replication of damaged DNA after TLS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After DNA damage is bypassed by error-prone DNA polymerases capable of translesion
  DNA synthesis (TLS), the replicative complex composed of PCNA, DNA polymerases delta
  (POLD) or epsilon (POLE), RPA and RFC, completes the replication of damaged DNA
  (Park et al. 2014). Replicated damaged DNA may then be repaired through base excision
  or another DNA repair mechanism before the next round of DNA replication.

## Summary
