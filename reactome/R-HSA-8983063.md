## Summary

Interleukin-7 (IL7) signaling is believed to resemble that of other gammaC family receptors, based on detailed studies of the Interleukin-2 receptor.

Cytoplasmic domains of the receptor chains re-orient so that their associated kinases (JAKs and possibly phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases) can phosphorylate sequence elements on the cytoplasmic domains (Jiang et al. 2005).
