species: Homo sapiens
summary: In an ATP-dependent process, G-beta reaches a near-native state in the folding
  cavity of TRiC, except that TRiC cannot mediate the folding of the seven-bladed
  beta propeller of the G-protein beta to a stable conformation (Plimpton et al. 2015).

## Summary

In an ATP-dependent process, G-beta reaches a near-native state in the folding cavity of TRiC, except that TRiC cannot mediate the folding of the seven-bladed beta propeller of the G-protein beta to a stable conformation (Plimpton et al. 2015).
