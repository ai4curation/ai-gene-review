stable_id: R-HSA-373700
display_name: Caspase-9 binds DCC:DIP13alpha complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ADD domain of DCC complexed with DIP13alpha interacts with the initiator
  caspase-9, leading to caspase activation and caspase-dependent cell death. DIP13alpha
  appears to function as a required adaptor to mediate DCC-caspase-9 interaction.
