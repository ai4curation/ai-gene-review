stable_id: R-HSA-443779
display_name: Linkage of L1 with treadmilling F-actin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The COOH termini of all ERM proteins have sequence motifs that bind directly
  to F-actin. The L1 molecules on the cell surface are translocated to the C-domain
  by coupling with the retrograde F-actin. The force generated by linking L1 clusters
  with retrograde F-actin flow leads to the migration of the growth cone.
