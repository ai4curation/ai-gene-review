display_name: Removal of RNA primer and dissociation of RPA and Dna2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Dna2 endonuclease removes the initiator RNA along with several downstream
  deoxyribonucleotides. The cleavage of the single-stranded RNA substrate results
  in the disassembly of RPA and Dna2. The current data for the role of the Dna2 endonuclease
  has been derived from studies with yeast and Xenopus Dna2.
