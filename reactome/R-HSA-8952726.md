display_name: SLC38A9 transports L-Arg from lysosomal lumen to cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 9 (SLC38A9 aka URLC11)
  is a lysosomal membrane protein mediating the transport of amino acids, especially
  L-arginine (Wang et al. 2015). It is proposed SLC38A9 acts as an amino acid sensor
  of the Ragulator and Rag GTPases complexes which are involved in the activation
  of mTORC1. The serine/threonine kinase mTORC1 regulates cellular homeostasis in
  response to many stimuli, such as nutrient status (for example via the transport
  of amino acids by SLC38A9) and energy level. SLC38A9 has been established to be
  an integral part of the Ragulator:Rag GTPase complex (Rebsamen et al. 2015, Wang
  et al. 2015, Jung et al. 2015).
