stable_id: R-HSA-111966
display_name: GRK2 binds CALM1:4Ca2+
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ADRBK1 (also known as GRK2) is a Serine/Threonine kinase. G-protein-coupled
  receptor kinases (GRKs) are important regulators of G-protein-coupled receptor function.
  Binding of calmodulin to ADRBK1 results in inhibition of the kinase activity. This
  inhibition is almost completely abolished when ADRBK1 is phosphorylated by PKC.
