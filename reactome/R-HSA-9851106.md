stable_id: R-HSA-9851106
display_name: p-Y705, S727 STAT3 dimer binds ICOS promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT3 binds to a region of the ICOS promoter downstream of NPM-ALK as assessed
  by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Although
  the phosphorylation status of STAT3 was not directly examined in the context of
  the ICOS promoter, STAT3 is a known NPM-ALK target and the stimulation of ICOS expression
  is dependent on NPM-ALK kinase activity (Zhang et al, 2011; reviewed in Chiarle
  et al, 2008; Ducray et al, 2019). STAT3 also contributes to ICOS expression through
  the downregulation of miR-219, a negative regulator of ICOS (Zhang et al, 2011).
