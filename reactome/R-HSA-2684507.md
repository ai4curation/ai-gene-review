display_name: Syndecans 1, 2, 4, (3) bind FGF2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Syndecans have attached heparan sulfate (HS) and to a lesser extent chondroitin
  sulfate (CS) chains. These allow interactions with a large number of proteins, including
  heparin-binding growth factors such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), mediating
  interaction with FGF receptors (Kiefer et al. 1990, Bernfield & Hooper 1991, Steinfeld
  et al. 1996, Chua et al. 2004). Various enzymes involved in post-translational HS
  chain modifications produce unique binding motifs that selectively recognize different
  proteins (Tkachenko et al. 2005). '
