display_name: UBQLNs bind UIM-containing adaptor proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: UBQLN proteins, also known as PLIC (protein linking IAP to cytoskeleton),
  are a family of four proteins with known roles in targeting ubiquitinated proteins
  to the proteasome (Mah et al, 2000; Kleijnen et al, 2000; Funakoshi et al, 2002).  More
  recently, UBQLN proteins have been shown to play roles in the regulation of GPCR
  signaling (N'Diaye and Brown, 2003; Regan-Klapisz et al, 2005; N'Diaye et al, 2008).
  The ubiquitously expressed UBQLN1 and 2 both interact with UIM-domain containing
  proteins such as EPS15; the interaction is mediated by the UBQLN C-terminal UbL
  domain (Regan-Klapisz et al, 2005; N'Diaye et al, 2008).  In the case of UBQLN2,
  interaction with UIM-containing proteins is required for UBQLN2 to negatively regulate
  clathrin-mediated endocytosis of GPCRs (N'Diaye et al, 2008).
