stable_id: R-HSA-1474158
display_name: GCHFR binds to GCH1 and negatively regulates its activity
species: Homo sapiens
summary: High levels of the end product, BH4, negatively regulate GCH1 via GTP cyclohydrolase
  1 feedback regulatory protein (GCHFR). BH4-dependant GCHFR in the form of a homopentamer
  complexes with the decameric GCH1 enzyme in the ratio 2:1 to inactivate it. L-phenylalanine
  reverses this inhibition. These regulatory steps control the biosynthesis of BH4.

BH4-dependant GCHFR in the form of a homopentamer complexes with the decameric GCH1 enzyme in the ratio 2:1 to inactivate it. L-phenylalanine reverses this inhibition. These regulatory steps control the biosynthesis of BH4. (Swick & Kapatos 2006, Chavan et al. 2006, Harada et al. 1993).
