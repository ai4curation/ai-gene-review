stable_id: R-HSA-5685603
display_name: SAP and EAT2 binds SLAMF6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The cytoplasmic tails of the SLAM-family receptors contain immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs). These ITSMs act as docking sites for the SH2
  domain of SLAM-associated protein (SAP) and the related Ewing's sarcoma-associated
  transcript (EAT) 2 (Latour & Veillette 2004, Kageyama et al. 2012). Both SAP  and
  EAT2 are expressed in natural killer (NK) cells, and their combined expression is
  essential for NK cells to kill abnormal hematopoietic cells. SAP mediates this effect
  by combining SLAM family receptors to the protein kinase FYN and exchange factor
  VAV, thereby promoting conjugate formation between NK cells and target cells. While
  EAT2 mediates its effects in NK cells by linking SLAM family receptors to phospholipase
  C-gamma, calcium fluxes amd ERK kinase (Perez-Quintero et al. 2014).
