display_name: Pre-pro-defensins are cleaved to remove the signal peptide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Pre-pro-defensins are cleaved in the golgi by undefined proteases which
  remove the signal peptide (Yang et al. 2004, Pazgier et al. 2006). Subsequently,
  alpha-defensins are cleaved again to produce the biologically active mature peptide.
  Beta defensins have much shorter propieces and may be active once the signal peptide
  is removed. Further N-terminal processing of the mature defensin may yield multiple
  forms of the same peptide (Pazgier et al. 2006). '

## Summary

Pre-pro-defensins are cleaved in the golgi by undefined proteases which remove the signal peptide (Yang et al. 2004, Pazgier et al. 2006). Subsequently, alpha-defensins are cleaved again to produce the biologically active mature peptide. Beta defensins have much shorter propieces and may be active once the signal peptide is removed. Further N-terminal processing of the mature defensin may yield multiple forms of the same peptide (Pazgier et al. 2006).
