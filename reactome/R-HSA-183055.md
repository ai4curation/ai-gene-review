stable_id: R-HSA-183055
display_name: Binding of CBL to EGFR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation at tyrosine Y1069 (i.e. Y1045 in the mature protein) of EGFR
  creates a major docking site for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, CBL (Casitas B-lineage
  lymphoma proto- oncogene) and  is required to sort the EGFR to lysosomes for degradation.
  The E3 ligase CBL plays a crucial role in these events as it dually participates
  in early events of internalization via a CIN85-endophilin dependent mechanism and
  endocytic sorting by mediating multiple monoubiquitylation of the receptor.
