display_name: IL21:IL21R:JAK1 binds IL2RG:JAK3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-21 receptor (IL21R, NILR) can bind Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) (Ozaki
  et al. 2000) but little or no signaling occurs (Asao et al. 2001) unless IL21R is
  combined with IL2RG, which is required for a fully signaling capable IL21 receptor
  complex (Ozaki et al. 2000, Asao et al. 2001, Habib et al. 2002). The heteromeric
  IL21 receptor complex can activate JAK1 and JAK3. <br><br>This is a black box event
  because the pre-association of IL21R with JAK1 and of IL2RG with JAK3 is inferred
  from the mechanism of IL2 signaling.
