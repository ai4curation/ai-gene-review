stable_id: R-HSA-1474146
display_name: GCH1 reduces GTP to dihydroneopterin triphosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The first and rate-limiting enzyme in tetrahydrobiopterin de novo biosynthesis
  is GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1, GTPCHI). Three different isoforms are produced but
  only isoform 1 is functionally active (Gütlich et al. 1994). GCH1 is functional
  as a homodecamer. First, a monomer of GCH1 forms a dimer. Then five dimers arrange
  into a ring-like structure to form the homodecamer (Nar et al. 1995).
