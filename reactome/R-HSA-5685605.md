stable_id: R-HSA-5685605
display_name: SLAMF7 binds SLAMF7
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule family member F7 (SLAMF7 also called
  as CS1 or CRACC) is a member of the CD2 family. It is expressed on CD8+ cytotoxic
  T lymphocytes, activated B cells, NK cells and mature dendritic cells (Boles & Mathew
  2001, Bouchon et al. 2001). It has been suggested that CS1 has both activating and
  inhibitory functions in NK cells. It may activate NK mediated cytotoxicity through
  an ERK-mediated pathway in a SAP-independent manner (Bouchon et al. 2001). Most
  of the CD2 members interact homophilically and CS1 is shown to be a self-ligand
  and that homophilic interaction regulate NK cell cytolytic activity (Kumaresan et
  al. 2002).
