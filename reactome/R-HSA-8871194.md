display_name: RAB5 and GAPVD1 bind AP-2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAB5 is a small GTPase that is implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis
  (Chavrier et al, 1990; McLauchlan et al, 1998; Shin et al, 2002; Taylor et al, 2011;
  reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandiger-Ness and Zerial, 2014).  Recent studies have
  shown that RAB5 and its associated GEF GAPVD1 may contribute to AP-2 uncoating by
  displacing AAK1 and promoting the net dephosphorylation of the AP-2 mu2 subunit.  This
  is predicted to destabilize interactions with the plasma membrane and promote uncoating
  (Sato et al, 2005; Hunker et al, 2006; Smerdjieva et al, 2008).  RAB5 and GAPVD1
  also increase PI(4,5)P2 turnover, likely through recruitment of a class I PI3K or
  a PI phosphatase (Christoforidis et al, 1999; Shin et al, 2005).
