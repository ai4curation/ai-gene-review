stable_id: R-HSA-8935930
display_name: miR-18a binds RUNX1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mature single stranded microRNA miR-18a-5p, one of the two products of miR-18a,
  encoded by the MIR18A gene, binds to the 3'UTR of RUNX1 mRNA, resulting in decreased
  RUNX1 mRNA and protein levels. As it affects RUNX1 mRNA levels, miR-18a is assumed
  to function as a component of the endonucleolytic RISC, but it is possible that
  it additionally functions as a component of the nonendonucleolytic RISC (Miao et
  al. 2015).
