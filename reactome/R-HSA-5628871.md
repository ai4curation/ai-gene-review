display_name: BRD7 promotes EP300-mediated acetylation of TP53
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BRD7 promotes EP300 (p300)-mediated acetylation of TP53 on lysine residue
  K382, which enhances binding of TP53 to its target promoters. Also, BRD7 induces
  EP300-mediated acetylation of histone 3 on lysine residue K10 (also labeled in literature
  as K9), creating the H3K9 active chromatin mark at CDKN1A and MDM2 promoters (Drost
  et al. 2010), and possibly other TP53 promoters co-regulated by BRD7, such as SERPINE1,
  TIGAR, TNFRSF10C and NDRG1.
