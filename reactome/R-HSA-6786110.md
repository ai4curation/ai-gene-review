display_name: JAK1 binds IL4R in IL13-bound IL13R type II
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In response to Interleukin-13 ( IL13) binding, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) binds
  to Interleukin-4 receptor alpha subunit (IL4R) (Roy et al. 2002). IL4R has 2 JAK
  binding motifs so it is believed that IL4R can bind JAK2 constitutively and additionally
  bind JAK1 upon ligand binding. The molecular trigger for JAK1 binding is not clear.
