stable_id: R-HSA-8865605
display_name: BRWD1 binds SMARCA4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BRWD1 (WDR9) is a nuclear protein with eight WD repeats at the N-terminus
  and 2 centrally located bromodomains. BRWD1 is thought to be involved in chromatin
  remodelling and transcriptional regulation. BRWD1 binds to Transcription activator
  BRG1 (SMARCA4 or BRG1), a component of the SWI/SNF complex(Huang et al. 2003). Similar
  to BRWD1 (Mandal et al. 2015), SMARCA4 is also implicated in B-cell development
  (Choi et al. 2012, Bossen et al. 2015).
