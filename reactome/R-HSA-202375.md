display_name: Recruitment of ITK to SLP-76
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'ITK is a member of the Tec protein tyrosine kinase family which forms a
  complex with SLP-76 after TCR activation. ITK has N-terminal pleckstrin homology
  (PH) domain, a Tec homology (TH) domain, a proline rich domain, a SH3 domain, an
  SH2 domain and a C-term kinase domain. The SH2 domain of ITK may interact with Y145
  within the N-ter acidic domain of SLP-76 and the SH3 domain of the ITK binds the
  proline rich region of SLP-76. ITK plays an important role in phosphorylating and
  activating  PLC-gamma-1, leading to the development of second-messenger molecules. '
