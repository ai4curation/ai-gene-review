display_name: Binding of PI3K to GRB2:GAB1 in complex with phosphorylated heterodimer
  of ERBB2 and EGFR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Regulatory subunit p85 of PI3K (PIK3R1) binds GAB1 in complex with GRB2 and
  phosphorylated ERBB2:EGFR heterodimer. Catalytic subunit p110 of PI3K (PIK3CA) is
  constitutively associated with the PIK3R1. Binding of PIK3R1 to GRB2:GAB1 in complex
  with phosphorylated heterodimer of ERBB2 and EGFR triggers a conformational change
  in the PI3K complex, resulting in PI3K activation (Jackson et al. 2004).
