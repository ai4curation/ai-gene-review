display_name: Dimerization of overexpressed FGFR2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Overexpressed FGFR2 in gastric and breast cancer cells has been shown to
  undergo ligand-independent dimerization (Takeda, 2007; Kunii, 2008; Moffa, 2004;
  Turner, 2010).  Full-length FGFR2 is weakly transforming in NIH 3T3 cells, and is
  thought to possess a transformation-inhibiting domain in the C-terminus (Itoh, 1994).  Interestingly,
  many cancers with amplifications of FGFR2 show preferrential expression of C-terminally
  truncated FGFR2 variants,  designated C2 and C3, with 788 or 769 residues instead
  of the wild-type 822 (Hattori, 1990; Itoh, 1994; Ueda, 1999).  These variants, which
  lack a number of carboxy-terminal tyrosine residues, show increased transforming
  potency compared to the full-length receptor (Cha, 2008; Cha, 2009), and have been
  shown to be constitutively active and to dimerize spontaneously (Takeda, 2007).

## Summary

Overexpressed FGFR2 in gastric and breast cancer cells has been shown to undergo ligand-independent dimerization (Takeda, 2007; Kunii, 2008; Moffa, 2004; Turner, 2010).  Full-length FGFR2 is weakly transforming in NIH 3T3 cells, and is thought to possess a transformation-inhibiting domain in the C-terminus (Itoh, 1994).  Interestingly, many cancers with amplifications of FGFR2 show preferrential expression of C-terminally truncated FGFR2 variants,  designated C2 and C3, with 788 or 769 residues instead of the wild-type 822 (Hattori, 1990; Itoh, 1994; Ueda, 1999).  These variants, which lack a number of carboxy-terminal tyrosine residues, show increased transforming potency compared to the full-length receptor (Cha, 2008; Cha, 2009), and have been shown to be constitutively active and to dimerize spontaneously (Takeda, 2007).
