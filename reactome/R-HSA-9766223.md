display_name: Proteasome-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated CDH1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MDM2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for CDH1 (E-cadherin), promoting its
  ubiquitin-dependent, proteasome-mediated degradation (Yang et al. 2006, Adhikary
  et al. 2014). Protein levels of CDH1 (E-cadherin) are decreased in a dose-dependent
  manner with increasing MDM2 level, which is dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase
  activity of MDM2 and proteasome activity (Yang et al. 2006). In primary tumors of
  breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis, protein levels of MDM2 and CDH1
  are inversely correlated (Yang et al. 2006). Overexpression of ectopic MDM2 in human
  breast cancer cell lines enhances cell dissociation, motility, and invasiveness,
  which is dependent on downregulation of CDH1 and independent of TP53, a well-established
  MDM2 substrate (Yang et al. 2006). MDM2 was shown to shorten the half-life of CDH1
  by pulse chase experiments, and was also shown to reduce the amount of CDH1 at the
  plasma membrane (Yang et al. 2006).

## Summary

MDM2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for CDH1 (E-cadherin), promoting its ubiquitin-dependent, proteasome-mediated degradation (Yang et al. 2006, Adhikary et al. 2014). Protein levels of CDH1 (E-cadherin) are decreased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing MDM2 level, which is dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2 and proteasome activity (Yang et al. 2006). In primary tumors of breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis, protein levels of MDM2 and CDH1 are inversely correlated (Yang et al. 2006).
