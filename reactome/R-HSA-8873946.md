stable_id: R-HSA-8873946
display_name: OTUD3 deubiquitinates PTEN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: OTUD3 de-polyubiquitylates and stabilizes PTEN, effectively removing Lys
  48-linked polyubiquitylation, but not monoubiquitylation nor the non-degradative
  Lys 63-linked polyubiquitylation of PTEN. In vitro OTUD3 efficiently removed the
  Lys 6, Lys 11, Lys 27 and Lys 48 types of ubiquitin chain on PTEN (Yuan et al. 2015).
