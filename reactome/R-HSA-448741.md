stable_id: R-HSA-448741
display_name: IL22RA2 binds IL22
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-2 (IL22RA2), also known as Interleukin-22
  binding protein (IL22BP), is a soluble receptor that binds Interleukin-22 (IL22)
  within the extracellular region, preventing IL22 from binding to the functional
  membrane-associated IL22 receptor (Xu et al. 2001, De Moura et al. 2009, Dumoutier
  et al. 2001, Kotenko et al. 2001). This may play a regulatory role in inflammation.
