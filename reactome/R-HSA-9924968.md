stable_id: R-HSA-9924968
display_name: CD274 mRNA binds miR-429 RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Being a member of miR-200 family, MicroRNA-429 (miR-429) role is extensively
  studied in tumorigenesis regulating cell growth and invasion. It acts as a tumor
  suppressor by suppressing cell proliferation and migration (Wang et al., 2019, Sun
  et al., 2014). It also get expressed during hypoxia by HIF1 and regulates multiple
  downstream targets (Bartoszewska et al., 2023). miR-429 acts as a negative regulator
  of CD274 (PD-L1) expression by binding to its 3' UTR, suppressing its translation,
  and thus reducing its expression (Lv et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2023).
