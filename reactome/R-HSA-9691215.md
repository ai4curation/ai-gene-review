display_name: VEGFA-165 dimer binds VEGFR2 dimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Binding of vascular endothelial growth factor A dimer (VEGFA dimer) to vascular
  endothelial growth factor receptor 2 dimer (VEGFR2, aka KDR, FLK1) (Ruch et al.
  2007) induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, leading to the recruitment
  of downstream signalling molecules. VEGFA isoform 4 (VEGFA-165) is widely expressed.
  Signaling through VEGFR2 is the major pathway that activates angiogenesis by inducing
  the proliferation, survival, sprouting and migration of endothelial cells (ECs),
  and also by increasing endothelial permeability (Lohela et al. 2009, Shibuya & Claesson-Welsh
  2006, Claesson-Welsh & Welsh, 2013).
