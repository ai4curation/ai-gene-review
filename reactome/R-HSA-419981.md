display_name: Recruitment of PAR-3:PAR-6:aPKC complex to tight junctions
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PAR-3 exists in a ternary complex with aPKC and PAR-6 to form the PAR-aPKC
  complex (Macara, 2004; Suzuki and Ohno, 2006). This complex is critically involved
  in the development of Tight Junctions (TJs) from primordial spot-like Adherens Junctions
  (AJs) (Suzuki et al., 2002). PAR-3 directly interacts with Junctional Adhesion Molecules
  (JAM)-A, -B, and -C (Ebnet et al., 2001; Ebnet et al., 2004).The interaction with
  JAM-A might anchor the PAR-aPKC complex to TJs but might also be necessary to recruit
  the PAR-aPKC complex to primordial spot-like AJs where it becomes activated in response
  to cell-cell adhesion (reviewed in (Ebnet et al., 2008). The PAR-aPKC complex might
  also be physically linked to the second polarity protein complex at TJs, the CRB3-Pals1-PATJ
  complex through a direct interaction between PAR-6 and Pals1 (Hurd et al., 2003).
