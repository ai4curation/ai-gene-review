display_name: CARMA1 recruits MALT1 and BCL10 forming CBM Complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CARMA1 is phosphorylated and recruits BCL10 and MALT1 to the plasma membrane
  to form the CBM complex (Sommer et al. 2005, Tanner et al. 2007). Evidence from
  T cells (Jurkat cells) indicates that MALT1 and BCL10 oligomerize to activate the
  IKK complex (Zhou 2004).
