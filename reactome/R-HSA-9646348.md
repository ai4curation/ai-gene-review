species: Homo sapiens
summary: Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) plays a key role in the removal of misfolded
  proteins when the proteosome system is dysregulated. HDAC6 associates with poly-ubiquitinated
  misfolded proteins and also to the dynein motor system. Subsequently, this complex
  of HDAC6,misfolded proteins and dynein motor form aggresomes (Kawaguchi Y et al.
  2003).
