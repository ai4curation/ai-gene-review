display_name: POU5F1 (OCT4), STAT3 bind the SALL4 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: POU5F1 (OCT4) and STAT3 bind the promoter of the SALL4 gene and activate
  its transcription (Babaie et al. 2007, Tantin et al. 2008, Bard et al. 2009, Yang
  et al. 2010). SALL4, in turn, positively regulates POU5F1 expression (Yang et al.
  2010). In mouse STAT3 is activated by Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), however
  LIF in humans does not have the same activity in promoting stem cell maintenance
  (Humphrey et al. 2004).
