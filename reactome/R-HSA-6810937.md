display_name: Lamellar bodies bind the early cornified envelope
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Lamellar bodies (LBs) ) are lipid-rich organelles produced by keratinocytes
  and secreted to form an impermeable water barrier (Feingold & Elias 2014). The lipids
  in LBs contain phospholipids, glucosylceramides, sphingomyelin and cholesterol (Feingold
  2007). These lipids, some of which are keratinization specific, are synthesized
  and accumulate in the trans Golgi apparatus, budding off as LBs that accumulate
  in the granular layer (Wertz & van den Bergh 1998). ). LB lipids also organize into
  characteristic intercellular lamellae (Kalinin et al. 2002). LBs fuse with the plasma
  membrane (Schmitz & Muller 1991, Chattopadhyay et al. 2003) delivering lipids which
  become ester-linked to involucrin and probably other cornified envelope proteins
  by TG1 (Nemes et al. 1991) and possibly TG5 (Candi et al. 2005), forming a monomolecular
  layer termed the lipid envelope. Eventually these lipids replace the plasma membrane
  lipid bilayer, which is reabsorbed. Extracellularly, the LB lipids are further metabolized
  to have a unique composition and are 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free
  fatty acids (Feingold 2007).
