display_name: CDK1 phosphorylates CDCA5 (Sororin) at chromosomal arms
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation of CDCA5 (Sororin) coincides with dissociation of CDCA5 from
  chromosomal arms in prometaphase. Several serine and threonine residues in CDCA5
  are phosphorylated by CDK1 in prometaphase, but only the three sites that perfectly
  match the CDK1 consensus phosphorylation sequence are shown here - serines S21 and
  S75 and threonine T159 (Drier et al. 2011, Zhang et al. 2011).
