stable_id: R-HSA-5637794
display_name: EGFRvIII does not bind CBL
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In EGFRvIII mutant, Y1069 (i.e. Y1045 in the mature protein) is not phosphorylated
  (Han et al. 2006, Grandal et al. 2007). Han et al. detected no CBL binding to EGFRvIII
  mutant (Han et al. 2006), while Grandal et al. detected very little binding, which
  they explained by indirect recruitment of CBL to EGFRvIII through GRB2 (Grandal
  et al. 2007).
