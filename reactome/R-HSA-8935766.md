stable_id: R-HSA-8935766
display_name: miR-378 binds RUNX1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The mature microRNA miR-378a-3p, one of the two single strand products derived
  from microRNA miR-378 encoded by the MIR378 gene locus, binds the 3'UTR of the RUNX1
  mRNA. Since miR-378 does not induce RUNX1 mRNA degradation, it is assumed that miR-378
  functions as a component of the nonendonucleolytic RISC. Levels of miR-378 are decreased
  in triple negative breast cancer (Browne et al. 2016).
