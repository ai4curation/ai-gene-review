## Summary

In the mitochondrial intermembrane space, TP53-regulated inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (TRIAP1) forms a complex with mitochondrial PRELI domain-containing protein 1 (PRELID1, PRELI) (Potting et al. 2013). TRIAP1 is also proposed to form a complex with PRELI domain containing protein 3A (PRELID3A) (Miliara et al. 2015).
