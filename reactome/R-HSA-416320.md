summary: 'GluR1-containing AMPA receptors are delivered to the synapses in an activity
  dependent manner. GluR1 trafficking is controlled by protein- protein interactions
  with 4.1N/G protein, SAP97 and by intricate regulation of phosphorylation of GluR1
  at several phosphorylation sites in the C tail. GluR1 has four phosphorylation sites;
  serine 818 (S818) is phosphorylated by PKC,  necessary for LTP, serine 831 (S831)
  is phosphorylated by CaMKII and increases the delivery of receptors to the synapse
  and also increases their single channel conductance, Threonine (T840) is implicated
  in LTP and serine 845 (S845) phosphorylated by PKA regulates open channel probability
  and also by cGKII, a cyclic GMP activated kinase, that increases the surface expression
  of GluR1. GluR1 insertion into synapse by CaMKII  may induce LTP. CaMKII  is a Ca/calmodulin
  dependent kinase that is activated upon increases in the Ca ion concentration during  postsynaptic
  activity through NMDA receptors. The increase in GluR1-containing AMPA receptor
  population at the synapse results in enhancement of excitatory post synaptic potential
  (EPSC) which forms the basis of Long term potentiation (LTP). LTP is one form of
  synaptic plasticity that is involved in memory and learning. The increase in the
  GluR1 containing AMPA receptors and their activity leads to rise in intracellular
  Ca which induces signaling pathways that in turn promote switch in the type of AMPA
  receptors (Ca impermeable) thereby limiting the Ca increase and preventing cell
  death. '
