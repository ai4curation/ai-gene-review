display_name: CTLH E3 ligase ubiquitinates PKM-1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CTLH E3 ligase complex transfers multiple ubiquitin (Ub) units onto PKM-1
  (PKM2), inhibiting pyruvate kinase activity. Which E2 enzyme and which ubiquitin
  linkage type are involved in these ubiquitination events remain an open question
  (Maitland et al., 2021). The CTLH complex consists of the proteins ARMC8, GID4,
  Muskelin, GID8, RANBP9, WDR26, and the catalytic subunits RMND5A or RMND5B and MAEA
  (Lampert et al., 2018; Maitland et al., 2019).
