display_name: Core MLL complex methylates H3K4Me2-Nucleosome at the THBS1 gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The WDR5-containing histone methyltransferase MLL complex, recruited to the
  THBS1 (TSP-1) promoter via RUNX1 (and possibly GATA1), is assumed to methylate histone
  H3 on dimethylated lysine residue K4 (K5 when taking into account the initiator
  methionine), producing the H3K4me3 mark. The H3K4me3 mark is characteristic of nucleosome
  associated with transcriptionally active promoters of megakaryocyte-specific genes
  (Herglotz et al. 2013) and the appearance of the H3K4me3 mark at the THBS1 promoter
  coincides with THBS1 transactivation (Michaud-Levesque and Richard 2009).
