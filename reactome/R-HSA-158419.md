summary: This Reactome event describes thrombin-catalyzed cleavage of factor XI (FXI)
  bound to the glycoprotein Ib (GPIb, GPIb:V:IX) complex on the platelet surface based
  on studies detailing the mechanism of thrombin-FXI interaction (Wu W et al., 2008;
  Shearin S & Venkateswarlu D 2022; Lakshmanan HHS et al., 2022; Barroeta AW et al.,
  2024). The reaction is further supported by studies using angiotensin II–infused
  mice, demonstrating that GPIbα-dependent, platelet-localized FXI is essential for
  thrombin-FXIa feedback activation in vivo (Kossmann S et al., 2017). These findings
  link FXI-dependent thrombin propagation on platelets with vascular inflammation
  and arterial hypertension (Kossmann S et al., 2017).<p>FXI, when bound to the cell
  surface, is converted to activated factor XI (FXIa) through a proteolytic cleavage
  at Arg387-Ile388 within its protease domain. In the body, this reaction occurs on
  the surfaces of activated platelets via interactions of FXI with platelet receptors
  such as GPIb (GPIb:V:IX), glycoprotein IV (CD36), and apolipoprotein E receptor
  2 (ApoER2) (Baglia FA et al., 2004a, b; White-Adams TC et al., 2009; Emsley J et
  al., 2010; Kossmann S et al., 2017; Mohammed BM et al., 2018; Reitsma SE et al.,
  2021). Binding to the platelet surface appears to protect FXIa from platelet-derived
  inhibitors (Reitsma SE et al., 2021). Alternatively, FXI can be activated upon binding
  to negatively charged surfaces, such as polyphosphate secreted from the dense granules
  of activated platelets (Choi SH et al., 2011; Geng Y et al., 2013). Activation of
  FXI can be catalyzed by factor XIIa, initiating fibrin clot formation. However,
  the efficient activation of larger quantities of FXI, needed to propagate the blood
  clotting process, appears to be mediated by thrombin (FIIa) (Gailani D and Broze
  GJ 1993; Naito K and Fujikawa K 1991; von dem Borne PA et al., 1995; Oliver JA et
  al. 1999; Monroe DM et al. 2002; Kravtsov DV et al., 2009; Matafonov A et al., 2011).
  Additionally, FXIa can be generated via autoactivation (Wu W et al., 2008).<p>Cleavage
  of FXI induces a conformational change that exposes the factor IX interaction site
  in the A3 domain of FXIa, enabling it to activate FIX (Gailani D et al., 2014; reviewed
  by Lira AL et al., 2024). Once activated, FXIa converts factor IX to FIXa, which
  subsequently activates FX, amplifying thrombin generation in a positive feedback
  loop.
