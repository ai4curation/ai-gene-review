summary: 'Fibronectin (FN1) binds many types of collagen, particularly when denatured  (Ingham
  et al. 1985). A region of fibronectin known as the gelatin binding domain (GBD)
  is responsible for the interaction (Ingham et al. 1988); structures of this region
  bound to collagen alpha-1(I) are available (Erat et al. 2009, 2010). FN1 has been
  reported to bind isolated collagen alpha-1(I), alpha-2(I) and alpha-1(II) chains
  as well as several CNBr fragments (Ingham et al. 1988, 2002) indicating that there
  are multiple FN1 binding sites within each collagen chain (Dessau et al. 1978).
  FN1 conjugates can bind collagen types I through V (Bell & Engvall 1982), VII (Lapiere
  et al. 1994) and likely others. FN1 binds to aggregating collagen fibres, probably
  at the sites shown to bind denatured collagen, inhibiting the rate of collagen fibrillogenesis
  which may regulate the size of collagen fibres (Kleinman et al. 1981). Blocking
  the interaction of FN1 with collagen prevents collagen I fibril formation (McDonald
  et al. 1982). Newly assembled collagen fibrils colocalize with newly assembled FN1
  fibrils (Li et al. 2003); FN1 fibril assembly and collagen fibril assembly may have
  common mechanistic elements (Kadler et al. 2008). '
