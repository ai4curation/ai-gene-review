species: Homo sapiens
summary: Syndecans (SDCs) are a major class of cell surface heparan sulphate proteoglycans
  (HSPGs) and the member syndecan-2 (SDC2) plays a critical role in EPHB-mediated
  spine formation in hippocampal neurons. Ethell et al. suggest that one of the mechanisms
  by which EPHB receptors regulate spine morphology is through phosphorylation of
  SDC2 (Ethell et al. 2001, Ethell & Yamaguchi 1999). Activated EPHB2 phosphorylates
  SDC2 at tyrosine residues Y189 and Y201 (Y179 and Y191 according to uniprot reference
  sequence) in the C1 and V regions respectively (Ethell et al. 2001).
