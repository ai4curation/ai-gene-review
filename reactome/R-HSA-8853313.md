display_name: FGFR2 fusions autophosphorylate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FGFR2 fusions in cholangiocarcinoma and cancers of the breast, lung and thyroid
  have been shown to promote anchorage independent growth, cellular proliferation
  and tumorigenesis. In some cases, such as for FGFR2-AHCYL1 and FGFR2-BICC1 fusions
  in cholangiocarcinoma, these activities have been shown to depend on the FGFR2 kinase
  domain, suggesting that the fusions undergo autophosphorylation after oligomerization,
  as is the case for WT FGFR2. FGFR2 fusions, where tested, also show sensitivity
  to kinase inhibitors such as PD173074 and pazopanib (Arai et al, 2013; Wu et al,
  2013; Seo et al, 2012; reviewed in Parker et al, 2014).
