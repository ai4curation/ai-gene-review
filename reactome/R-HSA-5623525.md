display_name: Cargo-carrying vesicles bud from the TGN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Membrane budding at the trans-Golgi network is promoted at least in part
  by the BAR domain of ASAP1, which is involved in sensing and inducing membrane curvature
  as well as providing the recognition site for small GTPases (Nie et al, 2006; Jian
  et al, 2009; Inoue et al, 2008; reviewed in Masuda et al, 2010). Oligomerization
  between ASAP1 and RAB11FIP3 may contribute to coat formation on vesicles budding
  from the TGN and destined for the plasma or ciliary membrane (Inoue et al, 2008;
  Mazelova et al, 2009; reviewed in Deretic, 2013).
