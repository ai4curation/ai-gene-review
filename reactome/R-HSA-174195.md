display_name: Ubiquitination of cell cycle proteins targeted by the APC/C:Cdh1complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: At the beginning of this reaction, 3 molecules of 'ubiquitin', and 1 molecule
  of 'cell cycle proteins:phospho-APC/C:Cdh1 complex' are present. At the end of this
  reaction, 1 molecule of 'multiubiquitinated cell cycle protein:APC/C:Cdh1 complex'
  is present.<br><br> This reaction takes place in the 'cytosol' and  is mediated
  by the 'ubiquitin-protein ligase activity' of 'cell cycle proteins:phospho-APC/C:Cdh1
  complex' (Rape et al.1996).<br>
