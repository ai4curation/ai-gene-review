stable_id: R-HSA-9623999
display_name: BCL gene expression downstream of ESR1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BCL2 mRNA and protein levels increase in response to E2 stimulation in a
  PKA-dependent manner (Grimaldi et al, 2002; Yune et al, 2008). Levels of phosphorylated
  CREB1 also increase with estrogen stimulation, however direct binding of phosphorylated
  CREB to the BCL2 promoter has not been demonstrated. Estrogen-dependent BCL2 expression
  is also dependent on Sp1 (Dong et al, 1999; Yune et al, 2008; reviewed in Ladikou
  and Kassi, 2017).
