  phosphorylates Gab2
species: Mus musculus
summary: Grb2 associated binding protein 2 (Gab2) is phosphorylated in response to
  Interleukin-2 (Il2) and Interleukin-15 (Il15) stimulation. Its phosphorylation is
  greatly diminished by mutation of the site in the Interleukin-2 Receptor beta chain
  (Y338F) (Il2rb, Il2rβ) that recruits SHC transforming protein 1 (Shc1) (Gadina et
  al. 2000, Wöhrle et al. 2009, Gesbert et al. 1998, Brockdorff et al. 2001). The
  Il15 receptor complex consists mainly of Il15, Interleukin-15 receptor alpha subunit
  (Il15ra, Il15rα), IL2rb, which is associated with Jak1 and Interleukin receptor
  2 gamma subunit, which is associated with Jak3 (Johnston et al. 1995). In this stage,
  it also includes a phosphorylated molecule of Shc1, a Grb2 and Gab2. This is a black
  box event because the kinase responsible for Gab2 phosphorylation has not been demonstrated.
  <br>More in detail, human and mouse IL15 have 70.2% amino acid sequence similarity
  and exhibit similar trans-presentation mechanism, signal transduction machinery
  and biological activities. Similarly, human IL15 shows cross-reactivity with mouse

  in mouse models (Stoklasek et al. 2006) (Patidar et al. data not published).
