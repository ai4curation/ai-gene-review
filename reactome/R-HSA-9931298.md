display_name: Ubiquitination of CD274 by ERAD complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ERAD complex consists of various components for substrate recognition,
  ubiquitination, and retrotranslocation. N-linked glycoproteins with abnormal Man7-5GlcNAc2
  are recognized by the ERAD substrate recognition factors, OS-9 and ERLEC1. An ERAD
  E3 ubiquitin ligase, such as HRD1, is recruited to the substrate via the adaptor
  protein SEL1L. PD-L1 is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase component of the
  ERAD complex, most likely HRD1 (Cha et al., 2018).
