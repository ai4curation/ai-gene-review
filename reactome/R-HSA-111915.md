display_name: CAMK4 autophosphorylates
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Autophosphorylation of the N-terminal serine residues, S12 and S13, of CAMK4
  is required for full activation after Ca2+/calmodulin binding and phosphorylation
  of the Ca2+/calmodulin-bound enzyme on threonine residue T200 by a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase kinase (CAMKK1 or CAMKK2) (Chatila et al. 1996).
