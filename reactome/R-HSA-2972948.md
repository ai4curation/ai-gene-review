stable_id: R-HSA-2972948
display_name: POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG bind the GSC promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, and NANOG bind the promoter of the GSC gene (Boyer et
  al. 2005, Lister et al. 2009) and POU5F1 represses expression (Babaie et al. 2007,
  Kunarso et al. 2010). GSC represses EVX1 and is required for formation of anterior
  streak-like progeny in response to Activin (Kalisz et al. 2012). As inferred from
  mouse, GSC is required for craniofacial development and rib development (Rivera-Perez
  et al. 1995).
