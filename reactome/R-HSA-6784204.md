species: Homo sapiens
summary: Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) beta and Oncostatin M receptor
  (OSMR) constitutively associates with the JAK-TYK family of cytoplasmic protein
  tyrosine kinases in the absence of ligand. Activation of these kinases occur as
  a result of ligand-induced heterodimerzation of LIFR beta or OSMR with gp130 (Stahl
  et al. 1994, Hermanns et al. 2000).

Activation of these kinases occur as a result of ligand-induced heterodimerzation of LIFR beta or OSMR with gp130 (Stahl et al. 1994, Hermanns et al. 2000).
