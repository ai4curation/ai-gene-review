species: Homo sapiens
summary: DNA polymerase iota (POLI) has an active site that favours Hoogsteen base
  pairing instead of Watson-Crick base pairing. POLI has the highest efficiency and
  fidelity in incorporating dTTP opposite to a template adenine (A). The active site
  of POLI causes the template A to rotate about its glycosidic bond and acquire a
  syn conformation. The hydrogen bonds are then established between the Hoogsteen
  edge of the template A in syn conformation (N7 and N6) and the Watson-Crick edge
  of dTMP (N3 and O4), which remains in anti conformation. POLI shows lower efficiency
  in incorporating dCTP opposite the template guanine (G) (Nair et al. 2004).<p><br>Hoogsteen
  base pairing and rotation of template purines from anti to syn conformation serves
  as a mechanism to displace adducts on template G or template A that interfere with
  DNA replication, as is the case with gamma-hydroxy-1,N2-propano-2'deoxyguanosine
  (gamma-HOPdG), or to allow base pairing of damaged purines with a disrupted Watson-Crick
  edge but an intact Hoogsteen edge, as is the case with 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine

  dCMP opposite gamma-HOPdG as efficiently as opposite an undamaged G (Washington
  et al. 2004). EtAD is generated when DNA is exposed to chemical carcinogens, such
  as vinyl chloride, or epoxyaldehydes that are produced by lipid peroxidation. POLI
  shows preferential dTMP incorporation opposite to a template EtAD, but can also
