summary: 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGNs) consist of 6-thio(dexoy)guanosine 5'-monophosphate

  diphosphate kinase (NME) plays a major role in the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates
  other than ATP. NME1 forms a hexameric complex with NME2 and this complex is thought
  to phosphorylate 6-thiodeoxyguanosine diphosphate (6TdGDP) to 6-thiodeoxyguanosine
  triphosphate (6TdGTP) (Karner et al. 2010).
