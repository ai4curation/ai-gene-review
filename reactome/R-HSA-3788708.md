display_name: CDKN1A (p21) prevents association of Cyclin A:Cdk2 with Cdh1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cyclin A-Cdk2 (CCNA:CDK2) prevents unscheduled APC reactivation during S
  phase by binding and subsequently phosphorylating FZR1 (Cdh1). Phosphorylation-dependent
  dissociation of the Cdh1-activating subunit inhibits the APC/C (Sorensen et al.
  2001). DNA damage activates ATM kinase, resulting in TP53-mediated induction of
  CDKN1A (p21) expression. CDKN1A binds CCNA:CDK2 complex and prevents its association
  with Cdh1 (Takahashi et al. 2012).
