summary: CD84 is a homophilic receptor expressed on T cells, B cells, dendritic cells,
  monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells, granulocytes, and platelets. CD84
  expression increases following activation of T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells.
  CD84 homophilic engagement is known to induce platelet stimulation.
