species: Homo sapiens
summary: K63-polyubiquitinated RIPK1 binds to IKBKG (NEMO), resulting in the recruitment
  of the IKK complex to the TNF-alpha receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling complex (Ea CK
  et al. 2006).<p>In addition, the linear polyubiquitination has been implicated in
  the NF-kappa-B activation. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) ligase
  consisting of HOIL-1L, HOIP, and SHARPIN, specifically generates linear polyubiquitin
  chains (Kirisako T et al. 2006; Walczak H et al. 2012). IKBKG (NEMO), a regulatory
  component of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, is a substrate of LUBAC. LUBAC-mediated
  IKBKG ubiquitination enhances IKBKG interaction with the TNFR1 complex and stabilizes
  this protein complex to promote activation of NF-kappa-B (Haas TL et al. 2009).<p>Structural
  analysis revealed that NPL4 zinc finger 1 (NZF1) of HOIP can simultaneously bind
  both leucine zipper domains of NEMO (IKBKG) and ubiquitin and that both interactions
  are involved in the TNF alpha-mediated NF-kappa-B activation (Fujita H et al. 2014).
