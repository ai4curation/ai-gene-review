display_name: TRAF6 binds MALT1 oligomers
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6) is a RING (really
  interesting new gene) domain ubiquitin (Ub) ligase that mediates NF-kB activation
  by regulating the ubiquitination of transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase
  (TAK1) and IkB kinase (IKK). TRAF6 has been implicated as downstream effector of
  MALT1. MALT1 binds to TRAF6 through two putative C-terminal TRAF6-binding motifs
  (Sun et al. 2004). Gorjestani et al. demonstrate that TRAF6 and TAK1 are required
  for C-type lectin receptor-induced NF-kB activation and play critical roles in anti-fungal
  innate immune responses (Gorjestani et al. 2012).
