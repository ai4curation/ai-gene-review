display_name: SDHAF4 binds to FAD-SDHA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 4 (SDHAF4) binds to flavinylated
  SDH complex subunit A (SDHA), stabilizing it before assembly into the SDH complex.
  The process has been shown in yeast and mice (Van Vranken et al., 2014; Wang et
  al., 2022).
