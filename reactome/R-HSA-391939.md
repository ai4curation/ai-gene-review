display_name: TP receptor can bind thromboxane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Thromboxane (TBXA2) is a potent stimulator for platelet aggregation and clot
  formation and also plays a role in vascular tone. The thromboxane receptor TP (Hirata
  et al. 1991) is found on the surface of vascular endothelium, platelets and in the
  placenta. Once bound to its ligand, TP's effects are mediated via coupling to G
  q/11 activation of a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system (Kinsella
  BT et al, 1997). TP signaling also involves G12/13 signaling; selective activation
  of G12/13 results in dense granule release in a mechanism that is independent of
  Gq/phospholipase C. The downstream mechanism for this is thought to be RhoA mediated
  activation of PKCdelta, as PAR-mediated dense granule release is inhibited if RhoA
  is blocked, and RhoA regulates PKCdelta T505 phosphorylation (Jin et al. 2009).
