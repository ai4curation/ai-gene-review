summary: Enzymes that belong to the NUDT (Nudix) superfamily catalyze the hydrolysis
  of phosphodiester bonds in molecules including nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates
  and nucleotide sugars. Family members are defined by the presence of an amino acid
  sequence motif shared with the E. coli MutT gene product, and are involved in diverse
  physiological processes (Mildvan et al. 2005; McLennan 2006).<p>The hydrolysis of
  nucleoside di  and triphosphates whose purine bases have been oxidized, deaminated,
  or methylated may protect the cell from the mutational damage that would occur if
  modified deoxyribonucleotides were incorporated into DNA and from the aberrant protein
  synthesis that would occur if modified ribonucleotides were incorporated into mRNA
  (Iyama et al. 2010; Takagi et al. 2012). The hydrolysis of ADP ribose may prevent
  the aberrant spontaneous ADP ribosylation of cellular proteins that could occur
  were this molecule to accumulate to high levels in the cell (Perraud et al. 2003;
