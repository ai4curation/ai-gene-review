display_name: Metallochaperone inserts 2Cu2+ into MT-CO2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A metallochaperone complex consisting of nine subunits (COA3, COA5, COX10,
  dimeric COX11, COX15, COX16, COX19, SCO1, SCO2) carries two copper cations from
  the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where they were delivered by
  the copper chaperone COX17, to the pre-assembled MT-CO2 subunit. These copper ions
  are frequently called CuA (Nývltová et al., 2022; reviewed in Ruiz et al., 2021).
