stable_id: R-HSA-5638006
display_name: ARL3 hydrolyzes GTP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RP2 is an ARL3 GAP that is localized to the cilium and plays a role in trafficking
  proteins from the Golgi to the ciliary membrane (Veltel et al, 2008a; Hurd et al,
  2011; Evans et al, 2010; Wright et al, 2011). RP2 forms a ternary complex with UNC119B
  and ARL3, activating the ARL3 GTPase activity and promoting the release of UNC119B
  (Veltel et al, 2008b; Wright et al, 2011; Kuhnel et al, 2006; reviewed in Schwarz
  et al, 2012; Li et al, 2012)
