species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation of CEBPB (C/EBP-beta) transcription factor on threonine residue
  T235 happens downstream of activated RAS, is mediated by MAPKs - likely MAPK3 (ERK1)
  and MAPK1 (ERK2), and positively affects CEBPB-mediated transcription of IL6 (Nakajima
  et al. 1993).

## Summary

Phosphorylation of CEBPB (C/EBP-beta) transcription factor on threonine residue T235 happens downstream of activated RAS, is mediated by MAPKs - likely MAPK3 (ERK1) and MAPK1 (ERK2), and positively affects CEBPB-mediated transcription of IL6 (Nakajima et al. 1993).
