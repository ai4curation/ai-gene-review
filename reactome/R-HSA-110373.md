summary: While the single nucleotide replacement pathway appears to facilitate the
  repair of most damaged bases, an alternative BER pathway is evoked when the structure
  of the 5'-terminal sugar phosphate is such that it cannot be cleaved through the
  AP lyase activity of DNA polymerase beta (POLB). Under these circumstances, a short
  stretch of residues containing the abasic site is excised and replaced (Dianov et
  al., 1999). Following DNA glycosylase-mediated cleavage of the damaged base, the
  endonuclease APEX1 is recruited to the site of damage where it cleaves the 5' side
  of the abasic deoxyribose residue, as in the single nucleotide replacement pathway.
  However, POLB then synthesizes the first replacement residue without prior cleavage
  of the 5'-terminal sugar phosphate, hence displacing this entity. Long-patch BER
  can be completed by continued POLB-mediated DNA strand displacement synthesis in
  the presence of PARP1 or PARP2, FEN1 and DNA ligase I (LIG1) (Prasad et al. 2001).
  When the PCNA-containing replication complex is available, as is the case with cells
  in the S-phase of the cell cycle, DNA strand displacement synthesis is catalyzed
  by DNA polymerase delta (POLD) or DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) complexes, in the
  presence of PCNA, RPA, RFC, APEX1, FEN1 and LIG1 (Klungland and Lindahl 1997, Dianova
  et al. 2001). In both POLB-dependent and PCNA-dependent DNA displacement synthesis,
  the displaced DNA strand containing the abasic sugar phosphate creates a flap structure
  that is recognized and cleaved by the flap endonuclease FEN1. The replacement residues
  added by POLB or POLD/POLE are then ligated by the DNA ligase I (LIG1) (Klungland
  and Lindahl, 1997; Matsumoto et al., 1999).<br><br>

## Summary

While the single nucleotide replacement pathway appears to facilitate the repair of most damaged bases, an alternative BER pathway is evoked when the structure of the 5'-terminal sugar phosphate is such that it cannot be cleaved through the AP lyase activity of DNA polymerase beta (POLB). Under these circumstances, a short stretch of residues containing the abasic site is excised and replaced (Dianov et al., 1999). Following DNA glycosylase-mediated cleavage of the damaged base, the endonuclease APEX1 is recruited to the site of damage where it cleaves the 5' side of the abasic deoxyribose residue, as in the single nucleotide replacement pathway. However, POLB then synthesizes the first replacement residue without prior cleavage of the 5'-terminal sugar phosphate, hence displacing this entity. Long-patch BER can be completed by continued POLB-mediated DNA strand displacement synthesis in the presence of PARP1 or PARP2, FEN1 and DNA ligase I (LIG1) (Prasad et al. 2001).
