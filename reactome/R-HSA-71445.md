stable_id: R-HSA-71445
display_name: PGAM dimers isomerise 2PG to 3PG
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cytosolic phosphoglycerate mutase dimers (PGAM1,2) catalyze the reversible
  isomerisation of 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate (2PG; 3PG). There are two isoforms of
  this enzyme, PGAM1 (isoform B) and PGAM2 (isoform M). In the body, erythrocytes
  express only PGAM1, while skeletal muscle expresses only PGAM2. Other tissues express
  both isoforms (Omenn & Cheung 1974; Repiso et al. 2005; Tsujino et al. 1993).
