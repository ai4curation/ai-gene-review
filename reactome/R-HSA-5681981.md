display_name: ATG3 transfers LC3 from ATG7 to ATG3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The activated LC3 protein is transferred to Cys-263 of ATG3 through a thioester
  bond (Ichimura et al. 2000, Tanida et al. 2002). Deletion mutagenesis, biochemical
  data and modeling suggest that recruitment of ATG3 to the ATG7 N-terminal FAP domain
  results in presentation of the ATG3 active site to the LC3-ATG7 thioester linkage
  from the opposing monomer in the ATG7 dimer (Tanida et al. 2012, Klionsky & Schulman
  2014). '
