species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cilium biogenesis is initiated by the docking of basal bodies, a centriole-derived
  organelle, to the plasma membrane (reviewed in Reiter et al, 2012). The centriole
  consists of a multiprotein core surrounded by a ring of nine microtubule triplets;
  the mother centriole additionally has 'distal' and 'subdistal appendages' that are
  critical for ciliogenesis (reviewed in Kim and Dynlacht, 2013; Firat-Karalar and
  Stearns, 2014; Bettencourt-Dias et al, 2011). Basal bodies initiate and anchor the
  extension of the axonemal microtubules and also associate with secretory vesicles
  which are thought to provide membrane components for the extension of the ciliary
  membrane (Sorokin, 1962; Sorokin, 1968; Bachmann-Gagescu et al, 2011; Tanos et al,
  2013; reviewed in Ishikawa et al, 2011; Reiter et al, 2012). Basal bodies are attached
  to the plasma membrane through a proteinaceous network of transition fibers that
  form part of the 'transition zone' at the ciliary base. The transition zone acts
  as a selective barrier or ciliary pore, excluding vesicles and limiting the diffusion
  of proteins and lipids from the cytosol or plasma membrane (Deane et al, 2001; Craige
  et al, 2010; Garcia-Gonzalo et al, 2011; Ye et al, 2014; Joo et al, 2013; reviewed
  in Nachury et al, 2010; Hsiao et al, 2012; Reiter et al, 2012). In addition to the
  transition fibres, the transition zone also consists of the ciliary necklace (a
  row of protein particles at the ciliary membrane at the base of the cilium) and
  the Y-links (that connect the axonemal microtubules to the membrane at the ciliary
  necklace) (Williams et al, 2011; reviewed in Hsiao et al, 2012; Reiter et al, 2012).

## Summary

Cilium biogenesis is initiated by the docking of basal bodies, a centriole-derived organelle, to the plasma membrane (reviewed in Reiter et al, 2012). The centriole consists of a multiprotein core surrounded by a ring of nine microtubule triplets; the mother centriole additionally has 'distal' and 'subdistal appendages' that are critical for ciliogenesis (reviewed in Kim and Dynlacht, 2013; Firat-Karalar and Stearns, 2014; Bettencourt-Dias et al, 2011).
