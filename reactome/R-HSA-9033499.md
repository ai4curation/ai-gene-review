display_name: PEX1:PEX6:PEX26:ZFAND6 dissociates Ub:PEX5L and PEX7 from PEX14:PEX13:PEX2:PEX10:PEX12
  and translocates PEX5L and PEX7 from the peroxisomal membrane to the cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Ubiquitinated PEX5 isoform L (Ub:PEX5L) is released from the peroxisomal
  membrane Docking and Translocation Module by PEX1:PEX6:PEX26 (the peroxisomal AAA
  ATPase complex, receptor export module) (Tamura et al. 2014, Law et al. 2017, also
  inferred from yeast homologs). PEX1 and PEX6 form a cytosolic hexameric ring that
  is anchored to the peroxisomal membrane by PEX26. Hydrolysis of ATP by PEX1 and
  PEX6 appears to cause a conformational change in PEX1:PEX6:PEX26 that removes Ub:PEX5L
  from the peroxisomal membrane and into the cytosol (reviewed in Saffert et al. 2017).
  ZFAND6 probably binds ubiquitinated PEX5 and PEX6 and acts as an export factor (Miyata
  et al. 2012). Export of PEX7 back to the cytosol requires export of PEX5L but PEX7
  and PEX5L appear to be exported separately (Rodrigues et al. 2014).
