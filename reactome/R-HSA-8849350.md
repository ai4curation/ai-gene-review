display_name: RAB6:GTP displaces PAFAH1B1 from dynein:dynactin complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Retrograde tubule formation may depend on the minus-end directed dynein-dynactin
  motor complex, which is recruited to the Golgi through interaction with both RAB6
  and BICD (Short et al, 2002; Hoogenraad et al, 2001; Matanis et al, 2002; Young
  et al, 2005; Januschke et al, 2007). Interaction of dynein:dynactin with RAB6:GTP
  activates the motor protein by displacing the PAFAH1B1 protein, which otherwise
  keeps the motor "idling" (Yamada et al, 2013; reviewed in Heffernan and Simpson,
  2014).
