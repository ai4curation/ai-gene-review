stable_id: R-HSA-8877612
display_name: DENND1s exchange GTP for GDP on RAB35
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAB35 localizes to the plasma membrane, to clathrin-coated vesicles and to
  the endosome where it plays roles in recycling of endocytic cargo to the plasma
  membrane, in synaptic vesicle recycling and fusion of exosomes. RAB35 is also required
  for cytokinesis and contributes to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and
  for GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin (Fuchs et
  al, 2007; Allaire et al, 2010; Kouranti et al, 2006; Dambournet et al, 2011; Rahajeng
  et al, 2012; Hsu et al. 2010; Uytterhoeven  et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2009; Davey
  et al, 2012; Humphrey et al, 2013; reviewed in Klinkert and Echard, 2016). RAB35
  is activated by DENND1A, B and C (Sato et al, 2008; Allaire et al, 2010; Yoshimura
  et al, 2010; Marat and McPherson, 2010; Marat et al, 2012; reviewed in Marat et
  al, 2011; Ishida et al, 2016). Interaction of RAB35:GDP with its GEFs promotes release
  of GDP, allowing GTP to bind, and precludes the interaction of RAB35 with GDI and
  CHM proteins (Wu et al, 2011).
