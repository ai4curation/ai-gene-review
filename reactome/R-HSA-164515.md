display_name: Fusogenic activation of gp41
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Fusion of HIV with target cell plasma membranes is mediated largely by the
  gp41 glycoprotein. This glycoprotein contains a stretch of strongly hydrophobic
  amino acids flanked by a series of polar amino acids at its N terminus. Subsequent
  to the second conformation change in gp120, the N-terminal fusion peptide of gp41
  adopts a position which brings it into close proximity with the target cell plasma
  membrane.  As gp41 is found in trimers within the viral membrane, the resulting
  structure of this conformational change is often referred to as a “prong”, in which
  three N-terminal peptides extend towards the target cell plasma membrane. The process
  of fusion begins at this time, with the N-terminus of gp41 inserting itself into
  the membrane of the target cell.
