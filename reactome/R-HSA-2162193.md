display_name: COQ3 methylates DHDB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mitochondrial O-methyltransferase COQ3 converts 3,4-dihydroxy-5-decaprenylbenzoic
  acid (DHDB) to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-5-decaprenylbenzoic acid (MHDB) (Jonassen & Clarke
  2000). COQ3 is a membrane-associated protein (Zhu et al., 2015). COQ3 is phosphorylated
  by COQ8B at multiple sites (Nicoll et al., 2024).
