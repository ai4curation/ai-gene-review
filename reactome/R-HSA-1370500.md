stable_id: R-HSA-1370500
display_name: PRLR binds SCF beta-TrCP complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation of PRLR on Ser-349 by an unidentified kinase enables recruitment
  of the SCF beta-TrCP ubiquitin ligase complex, which catalyzes ubiquitination of
  the receptor (Li et al. 2004). This downregulation mechanism is impaired in some
  forms of breast cancer (Li et al. 2006).
