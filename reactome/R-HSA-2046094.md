display_name: Elongation of gamma-lenolenoyl-CoA to dihomo-gamma-lenolenoyl-CoA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Gamma-linolenoyl-CoA (6,9,12-20:3(n-6)) is rapidly elongated to dihomo-gamma-linolenoyl-CoA
  (DGL-CoA; 8,11,14-20:3(n-6)) by the action of C18-PUFA-specific elongase 5 (ELOVL5).
  Two carbon atoms are added during this reaction. DGL-CoA later undergoes desaturation
  to form arachidonic acid (AA, 5,8,11,14-20:4(n-6)). <br>Depending on the cell type,
  DGL-CoA can also be metabolized  by cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases to produce
  anti-inflammatory eicosanoids (prostaglandins of series 1 (PGE1) and 15-hydroxyeico-
  satrienoic acid (15-HETrE)). GLA and these two oxidative metabolites exert clinical
  effects in a variety of diseases, including suppression of chronic inflammation,
  vasodilation and lowering of blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation
  and thrombosis. (Fan et al. 2001, Fan & Chapkin 1998, Kapoor & Huang. 2006)
