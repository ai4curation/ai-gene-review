species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Transcriptional coactivators recruited to the ligand binding domain (LBD)
  of the ligand-bound heterodimer of PPARG and RXRA include histone acetyltransferases,
  such as NCOA1, NCOA3, CREBBP, and EP300, components of the MED1 complex (also known
  as DRIP or TRAP complex), and PPAR-specific (PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B) and non-specific
  (NCOA2, NCOA4, NCOA6) coactivators.<br><br>NCOA1 (SRC1) binding to PPARG is supported
  by multiple studies (Zhu et al. 1996: mouse Ncoa1 shown to bind to mouse Pparg1
  and act as its coactivator; DiRenzo et al. 1997: NCOA1 from African green monkey
  cell line CV-1 shown to bind both mouse Pparg and human RXRA; Oberfield et al. 1999:
  binding to human PPARG2 shown; Yang et al. 2000: ligand-dependent binding of PPARG
  to NCOA1, and ligand-dependent binding of NCOA1 to the DNA-bound PPARG:RXRA heterodimer,
  species unspecified - presumably human; Mueller et al. 2002: comparable binding
  of mouse Ncoa1 to both Pparg1 and Pparg2 mouse isoforms; Fujimura et al. 2005: human
  recombinant NCOA1 associates with recombinant human PPARG2 in the presence of PPARG
  agonists; Allen et al. 2006: a mammalian two-hybrid assay using recombinant mouse
  proteins showed that PPARG agonists induce association of Ncoa1, to Pparg). NCOA1
  possesses a single LXXLL motif that binds to LBDs of nuclear receptors so that one
  molecule of NCOA1 is bound to PPARG and one is bound to RXRA (Gampe et al. 2000).
  The structural study showed that the LXXLL motif of human NCOA1 interacts with the
  LBD of human PPARG bound to synthetic agonist rosiglitazone, similarly to previously
  established interactions between NCOA1 and other nuclear receptors (Nolte et al.
  1998). NCOA1 also binds to RXRA in a ligand-dependent manner (Yang et al. 2000:
  species unspecified).<br><br>NCOA3 (ACTR) binding to PPARG is supported by multiple
  studies (Yang et al. 2000: ligand-dependent binding of PPARG to NCOA3, and ligand-dependent
  binding of NCOA3 to the DNA-bound PPARG:RXRA heterodimer, species unspecified -
  presumably human; Hartig et al. 2011: fluorescence resonance energy transfer – FRET
  – using human NCOA3 and PPARG). NCOA3 also binds to RXRA in a ligand-dependent manner
  (Yang et al. 2000: species unspecified).<br><br>CREBBP (CBP) binding to PPARG is
  supported by multiple studies (Mizukami and Taniguchi 1997: binding of mouse Crebbp
  to human PPARG2 in the presence of synthetic PPARG agonist; Oberfield et al. 1999:
  binding to human PPARG2 shown; Gelman et al. 1999: binding of the N-terminal region
  of CREBBP to human PPARG2 in the presence of synthetic PPARG agonists; Fujimura
  et al. 2005: human recombinant CREBBP associates with recombinant human PPARG2 in
  the presence of PPARG agonists; Allen et al. 2006: a mammalian two-hybrid assay
  using recombinant mouse proteins showed that PPARG agonists induce association of
  Crebbp to Pparg; Xie et al. 2015: binding of human CREBBP to PPARG2 in response
  to synthetic PPARG agonist; Park et al. 2022: a flavonoid, kaempferol, is a PPARG
  antagonist that prevents rosiglitazone-induced association of Crebbp with Pparg
  at Pparg target loci in mouse adipocytes).<br><br>EP300 (p300) binding to PPARG
  is supported by multiple studies (Gelman et al. 1999: EP300 stimulates transcription
  from PPAR response elements - PPREs - in the presence of synthetic PPARG ligands,
  and the N-terminus of EP300 binds to human PPARG2; Jang and Jung 2015: binding of
  Pparg to Ep300 in mouse white preadipocyte line 3T3-L1 is negatively regulated by
  Atf3). EP300 was reported to acetylate PPARG, which increases PPARG transcriptional
  activity (Han et al. 2010). Levels of acetylated PPARG are significantly lower in
  young than in senescent human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast cell lines (Han
  et al. 2010). EP300 was reported to directly bind to RXRA in a ligand-dependent
  manner and acetylate it on lysine residue K145, which increases RXRA transcriptional
  activity (Zhao et al. 2007: recombinant and endogenous human RXRA and EP300 were
  used). The interaction between EP300 and RXRA is negatively regulated by NR4A1 (also
  known as TR3), an orphan nuclear receptor, which can sequester RXRA to mitochondria,
  triggering apoptosis (Zhao et al. 2007).<br><br>The A/B domain of PPARG (residues
  1-136 in mouse Pparg2) is needed for recruitment of CREBBP and EP300 to PPARG target
  genes (Bugge et al. 2009).<br><br>PCAF is another histone acetyltransferase that
  may associate with PPARG (Puigserver et al. 1999).<br><br>The entire MED1 complex
  (also known as DRIP or TRAP complex) co-immunoprecipitates (coIPs) with the ligand-bound
  PPARG (Yang et al. 2000: ligand-dependent coIP of the MED1 complex associated with
  PPARG, ligand-dependent association of MED1 with the DNA-bound PPARG:RXRA heterodimer,
  species unspecified; Ge et al. 2002: recombinant mouse Pparg2 was used to coIP proteins
  from mouse embryonic fibroblasts; Allen et al. 2006: a mammalian two-hybrid assay
  using recombinant mouse proteins showed that PPARG agonists induce association of
  Med1, also known as TRAP220, to Pparg (Allen et al. 2006). Ge et al. 2008: recombinant
  mouse Pparg was used to coIP proteins from HeLa cell nuclear extracts). The interaction
  between MED1 and PPARG involves the LXXLL motifs in MED1 that are known to associate
  with nuclear receptors (Ge et al. 2008: mouse Pparg2 and human MED1 were used).
  Mouse Med1 binds with similar affinity to mouse Pparg1 and Pparg2 isoforms (Mueller
  et al. 2002). Epigenetic readers, such as BRD4, which can bind to epigenetic marks
  deposited at the PPARG target genes, may enable recruitment of the MED1 complex
  during adipogenesis (Lee et al. 2017). Mouse Med1 knockout fibroblasts were reported
  to be refractory to Pparg2-stimulated adipogenesis but not to Myod-stimulated myogenesis
  (Ge et al. 2002), but this does not depend on direct interaction between MED1 and
  PPARG (Ge et al. 2008). Knockout of another Mediator complex subunit, Med24, also
  impairs the adipogenic program in mouse fibroblasts (Ge et al. 2008). In mouse 3T3-L1
  preadipocyte line, it was shown that the Mediator complex component Med14 directly
  interacts with the N-terminus of Pparg2 and facilitates the recruitment of the Mediator
  complex to PPARG targets (Grontved et al. 2010). Med14 knockdown impairs adipogenesis
  in 3T3-L1 cells (Grontved et al. 2010). Mouse Med14 binds with similar affinity
  to mouse Pparg1 and Pparg2 isoforms (Mueller et al. 2002). A structural study of
  the RXRA heterodimer with VDR (Vitamin D3 receptor) found that a single molecule
  of MED1 was bound to the heterodimer, interacting with both RXRA and VDR (Belorusova
  et al. 2020: human proteins were used), which implies that a single MED1 complex
  associates with one PPARG:RXRA heterodimer. In an earlier study, RXRA was shown
  to have a lower affinity for MED1 compared to PPARG2 (Yang et al. 2000: species
  unspecified).<br><br>PPARGC1A (PGC-1alpha) possesses largely independent PPARG,
  EP300, and MED1 interaction domains (Wallberg et al. 2003). Mouse Ppargc1a binds
  with equal affinity to mouse Pparg1 and Pparg2 isoforms (Mueller et al. 2002). Human
  recombinant PPARGC1A associates with recombinant human PPARG2 in the presence of
  PPARG agonists (Fujimura et al. 2005). Direct interaction between PPARGC1A and MED1
  may explain recruitment of MED1 to PPARG even in the absence of LXXLL motifs in
  MED1 (Ge et al. 2008). Recombinant mouse Ppargc1a coIPs Mediator complex subunits
  besides MED1 from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells and wild-type, but not Med1 knockout
  MEFs (Wallberg et al. 2003). In a luciferase reporter assay, transcription from
  a PPRE is enhanced when PPARGC1A and MED1 are both present in addition to the PPARG:RXRA
  heterodimer and PPARG natural agonist 15dJ2, and all four proteins form a complex
  on target DNA based on electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Wallberg et
  al. 2003). When template DNA is histone-coated, prior EP300-mediated histone acetylation
  is required for PPARGC1A-stimulated transcription of PPARG:RXRA targets (Wallberg
  et al. 2003). Besides direct binding to PPARG, the histone acetyltransferases CREBBP,
  EP300, and NCOA1 also interact directly with PPARGC1A and PPARGC1A, which may aid
  in recruiting them to PPARG (Puigserver et al. 1999). The more N-terminal of the
  two PPARGC1A LXXLL motifs is necessary for its interaction with the coactivator-binding
  domain of PPARG (Li et al. 2008: human recombinant PPARGC1A and PPARG fragments
  were used for the crystallographic structural study). In mouse, it was shown that
  Naa10, an N-acetyltransferase, acetylates Ppargc1a, preventing its association with
  Pparg, and inhibiting beige adipocyte-mediated thermogenesis (Lee et al. 2019).
  NAA10 is overexpressed in cancer and in white adipose tissue of obese mice and humans
  (Lee et al. 2019). PPARGC1A was shown to directly associate with RXRA in a ligand-dependent
  manner and act as an RXRA co-activator, that may, in addition, facilitate recruitment
  of NCOA2 to RXRA (Delrive et al. 2002: human PPARGC1A and mouse Rxra were used).<br><br>PPARGC1B
  (also known as PGC1beta) can also bind PPARG and act as a transcriptional coactivator
  (Parham et al. 2015: human PPARG and human PPARGC1B co-immunoprecipitate in human
  endothelial cells treated with sphingosine 1-phosphate, also known as S1P, a putative
  PPARG ligand). Ppargc1b is strongly induced during differentiation of mouse brown
  adipocytes in a Ppargc1a-independent manner (Uldry et al. 2006). The presence of
  either Ppargc1a or Ppargc1b is needed for the development of mouse brown adipocytes
  and to increase mitochondrial density in differentiated mouse brown adipocytes in
  response to cold-induced adrenergic signaling (Uldry et al. 2006). Based on studies
  in mice, PPARGC1B is likely itself a PPARG target gene, with the PPARG:RXRA heterodimer
  shown to bind PPREs in the first intron of the PPARGC1B gene to induce PPARGC1B
  expression (Deng et al. 2011: Pparg-mediated induction of Ppargc1b was shown in
  mouse white preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 and in the white adipose tissue of obese
  mice). PPARGC1B and PPARGC1A likely bind to PPARG in a mutually exclusive manner.<br><br>NCOA2
  was reported to bind to PPARG in a ligand-dependent manner (Yang et al. 2000: ligand-dependent
  binding of NCOA2 to the DNA-bound PPARG:RXRA heterodimer, species unspecified, presumably
  human; Hartig et al. 2011: interaction between human PPARG and NCOA2 by FRET). While
  NCOA2 was reported to bind to RXRA in a ligand-dependent manner (Yang et al. 2000:
  species unspecified), in a structural study in which recombinant human proteins
  were used, the ligand-bound PPARG:RXRA heterodimer was reported to contain only
  one molecule of NCOA2, bound to PPARG (Osz et al. 2012). Another study, also using
  recombinant human proteins confirmed the 1:1 stoichiometry of the ligand-bound PPARX:RXRA
  heterodimer and NCOA2, showing that a single molecule of NCOA2 interacts with both
  RXRA (more weakly) and PPARG (more strongly), and this interaction is facilitated
  by both RXRA and PPARG binding to their respective ligands and to target DNA (de
  Vera et al. 2017).<br><br>NCOA4 (ARA70) was shown to bind directly to both PPARG
  and RXRA and activate transcription of PPARG target genes (Heinlein et al. 1999:
  human NCOA4, human RXRA, and mouse Pparg1 were used; binding to RXRA was dependent
  on the presence of RXRA ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid; binding to Pparg1 was enhanced
  in the presence of PPARG natural ligand 15dJ2 - 5-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin
  J2).<br><br>Based on a study using mouse proteins, NCOA6 directly binds to both
  PPARG and RXRA in a ligand-dependent manner and stimulates PPARG:RXRA-mediated transcription
  (Zhu et al. 2000).<br><br>Based on studies in mouse white preadipocyte cell line
  3T3-L1, AJUBA was reported to act both as a coactivator of PPARG, aiding in recruitment
  of EP300 and CREBBP to PPARG (Li et al. 2016), and to act upstream of PPARG, as
  a coactivator of CEBPB, aiding in recruitment of CREBBP and EP300 to CEBPB at PPARG
  and CEBPA gene promoters (Yan et al. 2022).<br><br>Combinations of coactivators
  that simultaneously bind to ligand-activated PPARG:RXRA dimers have not been fully
  elucidated, but can be regulated by cell type- and/or developmental stage-specific
  gene expression and posttranslational modifications. Also, different coactivators
  were reported to bind with different affinities to the PPARG:RXRA heterodimer in
  response to different PPARG and RXRA agonists (Yang et al. 2000: species unspecified).
  During human adipocyte differentiation, mRNA and protein levels of NCOA2 and NCOA3
  were reported to remain constant, while levels of NCOA1 increase; siRNA-mediated
  knockdown of NCOA1, however, does not affect lipogenesis significantly, while siRNA-mediated
  knockdown of NCOA2 and NCOA3 does (Hartig et al. 2011). Inhibitory phosphorylation
  of PPARG on serine residue S112, known to diminish PPARG ligand affinity, interaction
  with NCOAs, transcriptional activity and adipogenic capacity, was shown to be increased
  upon NCOA2 and NCOA3 knockdown and decreased after NCOA1 knockdown (Hartig et al.
  2011). CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of PPARG2 on serine residue S273 (corresponds
  to S245 in PPARG1) was reported to decrease the affinity of PPARG2 for the coactivator
  proteins MED1 (TRAP220), PPARGC1A (PGC 1alpha), and NCOA2 (TIF2) (Dias et al. 2020:
  human recombinant PPARG2 was used with human recombinant NCOA2, human recombinant
  MED1, and mouse recombinant PPARGC1A). Binding of NCOA1 and MED1 does not appear
  to occur simultaneously on each subunit of the PPARG:RXRA heterodimer (Yang et al.
  2000). Relative level of NCOA1 to NCOA2 can modulate energy metabolism (Picard et
  al. 2002). Ncoa2 knockout mice are protected against obesity and exhibit enhanced
  adaptive thermogenesis, while Ncoa1 knockout mice are prone to obesity due to reduced
  energy expenditure (Picard et al. 2002). In brown adipose tissue of mice, the lack
  of NCOA2 facilitates the interaction of PPARGC1A with NCOA1, which promotes transcription
  of thermogenic genes (Picard et al. 2002). As the roles of individual NCOAs have
  not been clarified, NCOA1, NCOA2, and NCOA3 are annotated as candidates in this
  reaction.'

## Summary

Transcriptional coactivators recruited to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the ligand-bound heterodimer of PPARG and RXRA include histone acetyltransferases, such as NCOA1, NCOA3, CREBBP, and EP300, components of the MED1 complex (also known as DRIP or TRAP complex), and PPAR-specific (PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B) and non-specific (NCOA2, NCOA4, NCOA6) coactivators.<br><br>NCOA1 (SRC1) binding to PPARG is supported by multiple studies (Zhu et al. 1996: mouse Ncoa1 shown to bind to mouse Pparg1 and act as its coactivator; DiRenzo et al. 1997: NCOA1 from African green monkey cell line CV-1 shown to bind both mouse Pparg and human RXRA; Oberfield et al. 1999: binding to human PPARG2 shown; Yang et al. 2000: ligand-dependent binding of PPARG to NCOA1, and ligand-dependent binding of NCOA1 to the DNA-bound PPARG:RXRA heterodimer, species unspecified - presumably human; Mueller et al. 2002: comparable binding of mouse Ncoa1 to both Pparg1 and Pparg2 mouse isoforms; Fujimura et al. 2005: human recombinant NCOA1 associates with recombinant human PPARG2 in the presence of PPARG agonists; Allen et al. 2006: a mammalian two-hybrid assay using recombinant mouse proteins showed that PPARG agonists induce association of Ncoa1, to Pparg).

The structural study showed that the LXXLL motif of human NCOA1 interacts with the LBD of human PPARG bound to synthetic agonist rosiglitazone, similarly to previously established interactions between NCOA1 and other nuclear receptors (Nolte et al. 1998).

NCOA3 also binds to RXRA in a ligand-dependent manner (Yang et al. 2000: species unspecified).<br><br>CREBBP (CBP) binding to PPARG is supported by multiple studies (Mizukami and Taniguchi 1997: binding of mouse Crebbp to human PPARG2 in the presence of synthetic PPARG agonist; Oberfield et al. 1999: binding to human PPARG2 shown; Gelman et al. 1999: binding of the N-terminal region of CREBBP to human PPARG2 in the presence of synthetic PPARG agonists; Fujimura et al. 2005: human recombinant CREBBP associates with recombinant human PPARG2 in the presence of PPARG agonists; Allen et al. 2006: a mammalian two-hybrid assay using recombinant mouse proteins showed that PPARG agonists induce association of Crebbp to Pparg; Xie et al. 2015: binding of human CREBBP to PPARG2 in response to synthetic PPARG agonist; Park et al. 2022: a flavonoid, kaempferol, is a PPARG antagonist that prevents rosiglitazone-induced association of Crebbp with Pparg at Pparg target loci in mouse adipocytes).<br><br>EP300 (p300) binding to PPARG is supported by multiple studies (Gelman et al. 1999: EP300 stimulates transcription from PPAR response elements - PPREs - in the presence of synthetic PPARG ligands, and the N-terminus of EP300 binds to human PPARG2; Jang and Jung 2015: binding of Pparg to Ep300 in mouse white preadipocyte line 3T3-L1 is negatively regulated by Atf3).

Human recombinant PPARGC1A associates with recombinant human PPARG2 in the presence of PPARG agonists (Fujimura et al. 2005). Direct interaction between PPARGC1A and MED1 may explain recruitment of MED1 to PPARG even in the absence of LXXLL motifs in MED1 (Ge et al. 2008). Recombinant mouse Ppargc1a coIPs Mediator complex subunits besides MED1 from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells and wild-type, but not Med1 knockout MEFs (Wallberg et al. 2003). In a luciferase reporter assay, transcription from a PPRE is enhanced when PPARGC1A and MED1 are both present in addition to the PPARG:RXRA heterodimer and PPARG natural agonist 15dJ2, and all four proteins form a complex on target DNA based on electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Wallberg et al. 2003).

PPARGC1B and PPARGC1A likely bind to PPARG in a mutually exclusive manner.<br><br>NCOA2 was reported to bind to PPARG in a ligand-dependent manner (Yang et al. 2000: ligand-dependent binding of NCOA2 to the DNA-bound PPARG:RXRA heterodimer, species unspecified, presumably human; Hartig et al. 2011: interaction between human PPARG and NCOA2 by FRET).

Another study, also using recombinant human proteins confirmed the 1:1 stoichiometry of the ligand-bound PPARX:RXRA heterodimer and NCOA2, showing that a single molecule of NCOA2 interacts with both RXRA (more weakly) and PPARG (more strongly), and this interaction is facilitated by both RXRA and PPARG binding to their respective ligands and to target DNA (de Vera et al. 2017).<br><br>NCOA4 (ARA70) was shown to bind directly to both PPARG and RXRA and activate transcription of PPARG target genes (Heinlein et al. 1999: human NCOA4, human RXRA, and mouse Pparg1 were used; binding to RXRA was dependent on the presence of RXRA ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid; binding to Pparg1 was enhanced in the presence of PPARG natural ligand 15dJ2 - 5-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin J2).<br><br>Based on a study using mouse proteins, NCOA6 directly binds to both PPARG and RXRA in a ligand-dependent manner and stimulates PPARG:RXRA-mediated transcription (Zhu et al. 2000).<br><br>Based on studies in mouse white preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1, AJUBA was reported to act both as a coactivator of PPARG, aiding in recruitment of EP300 and CREBBP to PPARG (Li et al. 2016), and to act upstream of PPARG, as a coactivator of CEBPB, aiding in recruitment of CREBBP and EP300 to CEBPB at PPARG and CEBPA gene promoters (Yan et al. 2022).<br><br>Combinations of coactivators that simultaneously bind to ligand-activated PPARG:RXRA dimers have not been fully elucidated, but can be regulated by cell type- and/or developmental stage-specific gene expression and posttranslational modifications. Also, different coactivators were reported to bind with different affinities to the PPARG:RXRA heterodimer in response to different PPARG and RXRA agonists (Yang et al. 2000: species unspecified). During human adipocyte differentiation, mRNA and protein levels of NCOA2 and NCOA3 were reported to remain constant, while levels of NCOA1 increase; siRNA-mediated knockdown of NCOA1, however, does not affect lipogenesis significantly, while siRNA-mediated knockdown of NCOA2 and NCOA3 does (Hartig et al. 2011). Inhibitory phosphorylation of PPARG on serine residue S112, known to diminish PPARG ligand affinity, interaction with NCOAs, transcriptional activity and adipogenic capacity, was shown to be increased upon NCOA2 and NCOA3 knockdown and decreased after NCOA1 knockdown (Hartig et al. 2011). CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of PPARG2 on serine residue S273 (corresponds to S245 in PPARG1) was reported to decrease the affinity of PPARG2 for the coactivator proteins MED1 (TRAP220), PPARGC1A (PGC 1alpha), and NCOA2 (TIF2) (Dias et al. 2020: human recombinant PPARG2 was used with human recombinant NCOA2, human recombinant MED1, and mouse recombinant PPARGC1A). Binding of NCOA1 and MED1 does not appear to occur simultaneously on each subunit of the PPARG:RXRA heterodimer (Yang et al. 2000). Relative level of NCOA1 to NCOA2 can modulate energy metabolism (Picard et al. 2002). Ncoa2 knockout mice are protected against obesity and exhibit enhanced adaptive thermogenesis, while Ncoa1 knockout mice are prone to obesity due to reduced energy expenditure (Picard et al. 2002). In brown adipose tissue of mice, the lack of NCOA2 facilitates the interaction of PPARGC1A with NCOA1, which promotes transcription of thermogenic genes (Picard et al. 2002). As the roles of individual NCOAs have not been clarified, NCOA1, NCOA2, and NCOA3 are annotated as candidates in this reaction.
