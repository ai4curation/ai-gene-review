stable_id: R-HSA-372693
display_name: Phosphorylation of BCAR1 by SRC-PTK2 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SH3-mediated binding of BCAR1/p130Cas to PTK2 is linked to enhanced tyrosine
  phosphorylation of BCAR1 at multiple sites. The Cas substrate domain contains 15
  separate YxxP motifs, a main site of tyrosine phosphorylation on the BCAR1 molecule.
  Once phosphorylated, this domain serves as a docking site for the SH2 domains of
  CRK or NCK adaptor proteins that affect the downstream MAPK signalling pathway,
  resulting in cell survival and increased motility.
