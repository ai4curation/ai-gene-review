stable_id: R-HSA-157849
display_name: Formation of translation initiation complexes containing mRNA that does
  not circularize
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The translation initiation complex forms when the 43S complex binds the mRNA
  that is associated with eIF4F, eIF4B and eIF4H. eIF4G in the eIF4F complex can directly
  contact eIF3 in the 43S complex. eIF1A is necessary for the formation of this complex.
