display_name: HYAL1-4 hydrolyze chondroitin chains
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Hyaluronidases (HYAL1,HYAL4) hydrolyze 1-4 linkages between GalNAc and D-glucuronate
  residues in chondroitin (or dermatan) (Kaneiwa et al., 2010). They also hydrolyze
  this linkage in hyaluronate, another glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composed of repeating
  disaccharide units but the only one which is non-sulfated (Frost et al. 1997). There
  are five human hyaluronidases (HYALs, endo-beta-acetyl-hexosaminidases), HYAL1-4,
  and PH-20 (Jedrzejas & Stern 2005). Mutations in HYAL1 can cause a form of mucopolysaccharidosis
  (MPS9, MIM:601492; Triggs-Raine et al., 1999).
