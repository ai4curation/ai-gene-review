stable_id: R-HSA-5628899
display_name: TP53 binds the TIGAR gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TIGAR gene possesses two TP53 (p53) binding sites, one upstream of the first
  exon and another within the first intron. TP53 can bind both sites, with a higher
  affinity for the intronic site (Bensaad et al. 2006).
