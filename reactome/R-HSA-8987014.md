species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is believed to
  bind the Interleukin-22 (IL22) receptor complex, which consists of  IL22, phosphorylated
  Interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL22RA1), phosphorylated Tyrosine-protein
  kinase JAK1 (JAK1), Interleukin-10 receptor subunit beta (IL10RB), phosphorylated
  Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase TYK2 (TYK2) and Tyrosine-protein phosphatase
  non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11 or SHP2) (Meng et al. 2010, Sestito et al. 2011). STAT3
  has been reported to pre-associate with IL22RA in the absence of phosphorylated
  receptor tyrosines (Dumoutier et al. 2009).<br>This is a black box event because
  STAT3 binding is represented here as a post-receptor phosphorylation event, inferred
