display_name: PDE6D binds INPP5E
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The inositol polyphosphate phosphatase INPP5E is a ciliary localized peripheral
  membrane protein with a CaaX prenylation motif in its C-terminus (Jacoby et al,
  2009; Bielas et al, 2009; Humbert et al, 2012). This motif is downstream of the
  ciliary targeting sequence and prenylation is not required for the ciliary localization
  of INPP5E. The CaaX motif is required for the interaction between INPP5E and the
  phosphodiesterase PDE6D, and PDE6D is required for the ciliary localization of full
  length INPP5E but not a truncated solubilized form. These data suggest that PDE6D
  may play a role in extracting prenylated INPP5E from a donor membrane prior to ciliary
  targeting (Humbert et al, 2012).
