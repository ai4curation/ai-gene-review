summary: 'Lck is a member of the Src family tyrosine kinases and these members have
  the following domains in common: N-terminal Myristoylation site for saturated fatty
  acid addition, a unique region, a Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain, an SH2 domain, a
  tyrosine kinase domain (SH1), and a C-terminal negative regulatory domain. Myristoylation
  engenders Lck with the ability to attach to cellular membranes. This interaction
  is mediated by both myristic acid and palmitic acid that are bound to the amino
  terminal glycine and Cys-3 and/or Cys-5. <br><br>The unique region of Lck is thought
  to be involved in the interaction with the cytoplasmic tails of coreceptors CD4
  and CD8. The Lck/CD4 interaction require conserved cysteine motifs: a CxCP motif
  in CD4 and a CxxC motif in the Lck unique domain. The SH3 and SH2 domains of Lck
  are involved in intramolecular and intermolecular regulation by mediating protein-protein
  interactions via poly-proline and phosphotyrosine-specific interactions, respectively.
  <br><br>Lck adopts specific conformation that largely dictate its level of activity.
  The C-ter tail has an autoinhibitory phosphorylation site (tyr 505). When the Y505
  is phosphorylated, Lck adopts a closed conformation, where the pY505 residue creates
  an intramolecular binding motif for the SH2 domain, effectively inactivating the
  kinase domain. The inactivating phosphorylation on Y505 is carried out by the Src-specific
  kinase Csk. '
