display_name: WDR83:LAMTOR2:LAMTOR3 binds MAPK components
species: Homo sapiens
summary: LAMTOR3 (also known as MEK partner 1, MP1) exists in an obligatory complex
  with LAMTOR2 (p14) at the endosomal membrane where they act as a scaffold and promote
  MAPK activation (Schaeffer et al, 1998; Teis et al, 2002; Teis et al, 2006; Sharma
  et al, 2005). The LAMTOR2/LAMTOR3 complex may also be part of a larger molecular
  weight complex at the endosome that includes the MAPK organizer protein MORG1 (Vomastek
  et al, 2004; Sharma et al, 2005; reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011).
