stable_id: R-HSA-68825
display_name: Ubiquitinated geminin is degraded by the proteasome
species: Homo sapiens
summary: APC/C-dependent degradation of geminin (GMNN) was first demonstrated in Xenopus
  (McGarry and Kirschner 1998) and was shown to be proteasome-dependent and sensitive
  to FBXO5 (Emi1)-mediated inhibition of the APC/C:Cdh1 activity in human cells (Machida
  and Dutta 2007).
