display_name: TCR complex interacts with peptide antigen-presenting MHC Class I
species: Homo sapiens
summary: T cells distinguish foreign material from self through presentation of fragments
  of the antigen by the MHC cell surface receptors. Only if an MHC molecule presents
  an appropriate antigenic peptide will a cellular immune response be triggered. The
  orchestration of recognition and signaling events, from the initial recognition
  of antigenic peptides to the lysis of the target cell, is performed in a localized
  environment on the T cell, called the immunological synapse, and requires the coordinated
  activities of several T-Cell Receptor (TCR)-associated molecules. This particular
  reaction depicts the interaction of the TCR with MHC Class I molecules on somatic
  cell, requiring the support of CD3 and CD8 proteins.
