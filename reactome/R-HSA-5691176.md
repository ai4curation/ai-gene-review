display_name: NEDD8 binds CUL1 (in SKP1:CUL1:FXBL5)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cellular iron homeostasis is maintained by the coordinate posttranscriptional
  regulation of iron metabolism genes. The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex comprising
  the F-box/LRR-repeat protein 5 (FBXL5) protein, S-phase kinase-associated protein
  1 (SKP1), cullin 1 (CUL1) and NEDD8. NEDD8 (Neddylin, Neural precursor cell expressed
  developmentally down-regulated protein 8) is a ubiquitin-like protein which plays
  an important role in cell cycle control and embryogenesis. NEDD8 covalently attachs
  to cullins (eg CUL1)  and activates their associated E3-ubiquitin ligase activity
  thus promoting polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of cyclins and other
  regulatory proteins (Hori et al. 1999).
