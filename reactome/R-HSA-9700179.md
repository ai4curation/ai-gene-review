summary: The ALK locus is subject to chromosomal translocations and inversions that
  give rise to oncogenic fusion proteins in a number of different cancers. To date,
  ALK has been identified as a fusion partner with more than 25 proteins in cancers
  ranging from anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
  diffuse B-cell lymphoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic
  tumors, among others (reviewed in Roskoski, 2013; Della Corte et al, 2018). These
  fusion proteins form constitutive, ligand-independent dimers by virtue of an N-terminal
  dimerization domain contributed by the fusion partner, and retain the intracellular
  region of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase. Expression (and often overexpression)
  of the fusion proteins is regulated by the promoter of the fusion partner. Signaling
  downstream of the fusion proteins occurs through numerous pathways including the
  MAP kinase, PI3K and STAT cascades, among others, but the extent to which each pathway
  is activated downstream of the different fusions varies (Armstrong et al, 2004;
  reviewed in Hallberg and Palmer, 2013; Hallberg and Palmer, 2016; Della Corte et
  al, 2018, Roskoski, 2013).  <br>The best characterized ALK fusion protein is NPM-ALK,
  which occurs in 75-80% of ALCLs, and fuses the intracellular portion of ALK with
  the N-terminal region of nucleophosmin, a protein involved in DNA repair, transcription
  and genome stability. NPM-ALK constitutively dimerizes based on the N-terminal NPM
  region. Deletion of the N-terminal domain abrogates oligomerization and abolishes
  the transformation activity of the protein (Morris et al, 1995; Fujimoto et al,
  1996). <br>In addition to NPM, fusions with ALK have also been identified with EML4
  (Soda et al, 2007; Choi et al, 2008; Takezawa et al, 2011), CLTC (De Paepe et al,
