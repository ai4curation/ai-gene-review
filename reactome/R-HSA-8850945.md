display_name: Casein kinase II phosphorylates PTEN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Casein kinase II (CK2) constitutively phosphorylates the C-terminal tail
  of PTEN on serine and threonine residues S370, S380, T382, T383 and S385. S370 and
  S385 are the main CK2 phosphorylation sites in PTEN (Torres and Pulido 2001, Miller
  et al. 2002). CK2-mediated phosphorylation increases PTEN protein stability (Torres
  and Pulido 2001) but results in ~30% reduction in PTEN lipid phosphatase activity
  (Miller et al. 2002).
