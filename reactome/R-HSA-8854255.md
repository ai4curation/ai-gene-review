display_name: TBC1D2A accelerates GTP hydrolysis by RAB7
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAB7, a small GTPase of the Rab family is associated with both endosomes
  and lysosomes. It facilitates endosomal maturation, transport from late endosomes
  to lysosomes, and the positioning of endosomes and lysosomes via regulating their
  movement along the cytoskeleton. RAB7 is inactivated through hydrolysis of bound
  GTP into GDP by its intrinsic GTPase activity, which is catalysed by the activity
  of a GAP (GTPase activating protein).  <br>TBC1 domain family member 2A (TBC1D2A
  also referred as ARMUS for variant c; PARIS1 for variant a) is a member of the TBC/RabGAP
  family (Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16; TBC domain) that specifically inactivates RAB7 by accelerating
  its GTPase activity. TBC1D2A binds specifically to activated Rac1 and its C-terminal
  TBC/RabGAP domain inactivates RAB7 to promote ARF6-induced E-Cadherin degradation
  (Frasa et al. 2010). During the regulation of autophagy, TBC1D2A is recruited to
  autophagosomes by interacting with LC3, a core autophagy regulator, thereby inhibiting
  RAB7 (Carroll et al. 2013)
