stable_id: R-HSA-444691
display_name: Prokineticin receptors bind prokineticin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Prokineticin receptors 1 and 2 are receptors for the bioactive peptides Prokineticin
  1 and prokineticin 2 (PK1 and PK2). Both PKs have 10 conserved cysteines and about
  40% amino acid identity with each other. PKs potently contract gastrointestinal
  smooth muscle.
