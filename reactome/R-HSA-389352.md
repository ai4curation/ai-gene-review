display_name: Translocation of Vav1 to CD28
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Vav1 protein is a cytoplasmic guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for
  Rho-family GTPases. CD28 co-stimulation resulted in a prolonged and sustained phosphorylation
  and membrane localization of Vav1 in comparison to T-cell receptor activation alone.
  Vav1 contains a unique arrangement of signaling motifs a calponin homology domain,
  an acidic domain, a DBL homology (DH) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain,
  a cysteine-rich domain (CR), and a SH2 domain flanked by two proline-binding SH3
  domains. Vav-1 may be recruited to the membrane through its PH domain by binding
  PI(3,4,5)P3 produced by CD28-bound PI3K and also by binding to CD28:Grb2 complexes
  by the dimerized SH3 domains in both the molecules (Hehner et al. ).
