stable_id: R-HSA-200425
display_name: Carnitine shuttle
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The mitochondrial carnitine system catalyzes the transport of long-chain
  fatty acids  into the mitochondrial matrix where they undergo beta oxidation. This
  transport system consists of the malonyl-CoA sensitive carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  I (CPT-I) localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane, the carnitine:acylcarnitine
  translocase, an integral inner membrane protein, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  II localized on the matrix side of the inner membrane. (Kerner & Hoppel, 2000; Ramsay
  et al. 2001). Additional reactions annotated here enable the uptake of carnitine
  and the regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis at the level of ACACA and ACACB to
  minimize simultaeous mitochondrial catabolism and cytosolic biosynthesis of long-chain
  fatty acids.
