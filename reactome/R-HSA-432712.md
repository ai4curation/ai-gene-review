display_name: Vamp And trans-Golgi Network AP-1 Binding Coupled With Cargo Capture
  On Lysosome Vesicle Destined Golgi Membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once AP-1 is recruited to the trans-Golgi Network membrane the complex of
  functional vesicle building proteins is joined by the cargo that will be within
  that vesicle. As with other types of vesicles the cargo itself is part of the vesicle
  development. Here the cargo is destined for the lysosome membrane. It is at this
  stage that a specific Synaptobrevin (Vamp) molecule also joins the complex. It should
  be noted that only certain Vamp molecules will be found with specific cargo molecules
  on the newly forming vesicles. However here we represent this reaction in bulk,
  without specific Vamp and cargo molecule pairings.
