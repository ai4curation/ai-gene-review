display_name: GLI1 is degraded by the proteasome after ubiquitination by ITCH
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the absence of Hh signal, GLI1 is degraded by the proteasome.  Degradation
  depends on GLI1 ubiquitination by SCF(beta-TrCP) and by the E3 ligase ITCH (Huntzicker
  et al, 2006; di Marcotullio et al, 2006, 2011).

## Summary

In the absence of Hh signal, GLI1 is degraded by the proteasome.  Degradation depends on GLI1 ubiquitination by SCF(beta-TrCP) and by the E3 ligase ITCH (Huntzicker et al, 2006; di Marcotullio et al, 2006, 2011).
