summary: Phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 MH2 domain mutants cannot form heterotrimers
  with SMAD4 (Fleming et al. 2013), leading to the loss of TGF-beta-induced regulation
  of gene expression and aberrant cell differentiation and proliferation.<br><br>SMAD2
  MH2 domain mutants SMAD2 A354T, SMAD2 D300A, SMAD2 D300N and SMAD2 P305L, as well
  as SMAD3 MH2 domain mutants SMAD3 D258N and SMAD3 R268C are annotated as characterized
  mutant set members based on structural and/or functional studies (Fleming et al.
  2013). SMAD2 mutants SMAD2 D300V and SMAD2 P305Q, and SMAD3 mutant SMAD2 R268C are

  characterized mutants.<br><br>As SMAD2 and SMAD3 MH2 domain mutations mainly affect
  amino acid residues involved in SMAD oligomerization (Fleming et al. 2013) and not
  residues involved in SMAD2/SMAD3 binding to ZFYVE9 (SARA) nor the phosphorylation
  motif (Wu et al. 2000), it is assumed that SARA can recruit SMAD2/3 MH2 domain mutants
  to activated TGF-beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1), and that SMAD2/3 MH2 domain mutants can
  be phosphorylated by TGFBR1, after which they would dissociate from TGFBR1, similarly
  to the wild-type SMAD2 and SMAD3. This has not been directly experimentally examined.
