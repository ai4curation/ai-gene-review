display_name: IFNAR2:JAK1:STAT2 binds JAK1,2 inhibitors
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family of intracellular tyrosine kinases that
  play an essential role in the signaling of numerous cytokines that have been implicated
  in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. JAK1 binds to and is inhibited by
  several small molecule drugs (Clark et al. 2014, Fridman et al. 2010). Drugs that
  inhibit these kinases such as baricitinib, tofacitinib, delgocitinib and ruxolitinib
  are thus plausible candidates for treatment of severe host inflammatory reactions
  to viral infection (Peterson et al. 2020, Richardson et al. 2020).
