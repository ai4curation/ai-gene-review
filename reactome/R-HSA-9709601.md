display_name: Defective recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 due to loss of BRCA2 function
  in PALB2 binding
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The extreme N-terminus of BRCA2, involving amino acid residues 10-40, is
  necessary and sufficient for PALB2 binding (Xia et al. 2006). Several germline BRCA2
  missense mutations identified in breast cancer patients map to this region and impair
  the ability of BRCA2 recombinant constructs that include the first 60 amino acids
  of BRCA2 to bind to PALB2:<br>BRCA2 G25R (severely diminished binding to PALB2,
  Xia et al. 2006)<br>BRCA2 W31R (complete loss of PALB2 binding, Xia et al. 2006)<br>BRCA2
  W31C (complete loss of PALB2 binding, Xia et al. 2006)<br>
