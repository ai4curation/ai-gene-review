summary: <p>WEE1, a nuclear kinase, phosphorylates cyclin B1:Cdc2 (CCNB1:CDK1) on
  tyrosine 15 (Y15), inactivating the complex (Parker and Piwnica-Worms 1992, McGowan
  and Russell 1993, Watanabe et al., 1995). The complex of cyclin B2 and Cdc2 (CCNB2:CDK1)
  is also phosphorylated on Y15 (Galaktionov and Beach 1991). Two-dimensional gel
  electrophoresis of protein extracts of cycling human cells has shown that CDK1 triple
  phosphorylated at T14, Y15, and T161 is the most abundant form of CDK1 that co-immunoprecipitates
  with CCNA2 or CCNB1, and Y15 phosphorylation of CDK1 was confirmed to be WEE1-dependent
