display_name: FOXO3-dependent BCL2L11 gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BCL2L11 (also known as BIM) is a pro-apoptotic factor whose expression is
  downregulated by FLT3 signaling as a consequence of AKT-dependent FOXO3 phosphorylation
  and nuclear export (Brandts et al, 2005; Scheijen et al, 2004; reviewed in Kazi
  and Ronnstrand, 2019; Yadav et al, 2018).. Downregulation of BCL2L11 may contribute
  to evasion of apoptosis and promote cellular survival downstream of FLT3 and FLT3
  ITD signaling (Nordigarden et al, 2009).
