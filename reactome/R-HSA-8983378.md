display_name: IL15:IL15RA:p-Y-IL2RB:p-Y-JAK1:p-Y-IL2RG:p-Y-JAK3 binds STAT3 and STAT5
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), Signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 5A and 5B (STAT5) are believed to bind the Interleukin-15
  (IL15) receptor complex, which consists of IL15, Interleukin-15 receptor alpha subunit
  (IL15RA, IL15Rα), Interleukin-2 receptor beta subunit (IL2RB, IL2Rβ), which is associated
  with JAK1 and Interleukin receptor gamma subunit, which is associated with JAK3
  (Johnston et al. 1995). This is a black-box event because STAT binding is inferred
  from their subsequent phosphorylation.
