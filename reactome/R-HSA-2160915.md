display_name: Receptor-mediated uptake of HA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HA receptors mediate the uptake of HA into cells. CD44 consists of four functional
  domains, the extracellular distal domain being the HA-binding region (Culty et al.
  1990, Asher & Bignami 1992). The receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility (RHAMM,
  also called HMMR) can bind HA but not heparin or chondroitin sulfate (Assmann et
  al. 1998, Wang et al. 1996). Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor
  1 (LYVE1) removes HA from the lymphatic system (Banerji et al. 1999). It is present
  mainly on lymphatic endothelial cells but also in liver sinusoids. Hyaluronan receptor
  for endocytosis (HARE, stabilin-2, STAB2) binds to and mediates endocytosis of HA
  (Harris et al. 2007, Harris et al. 2004). HARE can also bind other glycosaminoglycans
  such as heparin (Harris et al. 2008).<br>High molecular weight HA is tethered to
  the cell surface by HA receptors and the GPI-linked hyaluronidase 2 (HYAL2) to form
  a HA:HAR:HYAL2 complex in the plasma membrane that localizes to caveolae (invaginations
  of the plasma membrane composed of cholesterol and gangliosides and rich in caveolin
  and flotillin).
