species: Homo sapiens
summary: SLC40A1 (MTP1 aka ferroportin or IREG1) is highly expressed on macrophages
  where it mediates iron efflux from the breakdown of haem. Normally, SLC40A1 colocalises
  with ceruloplasmin (CP) which stablizes SLC40A1 and is necessary for the efflux
  reaction to occur. In addition, six copper ions are required by ceruloplasmin as
  a cofactor.<br>Defects in SLC40A1 can cause hemochromatosis 4 (HFE4; MIM:606069),
  a disorder of iron metabolism characterised by iron overload. Excess iron is deposited
  in a variety of organs leading to their failure, resulting in serious illnesses
  including cirrhosis, hepatomas, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, arthritis and hypogonadotropic
  hypogonadism. Severe effects of the disease don't usually appear until after decades
  of progressive iron overloading. Mutations causing HFE4 include N144H, A77D, V162del,
  G80V, D181V and D157G (Njajou et al. 2001, Agarwal et al. 2006, Wallace et al. 2002,
