summary: 'Precursor of the proteasome 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) base associates
  with the lid to form the 19S RP precursor. In yeast, a highly evolutionarily conserved
  C-terminal tail of Rpn12 (ortholog of human PSMD8) and the protein Rpn10 (ortholog
  of human PSMD4) play crucial roles in lid-base association (reviewed in Tomko and
  Hochstrasser 2013). In human proteasome, however, no direct interaction between
  PSMD4 (Rpn10) and PSMD8 (Rpn12) was detected and PSMD4 (Rpn10) was instead shown
  to bind to a base protein PSMD1 (Rpn2) and a lid protein PSMD14 (Rpn11) (Hendil
  et al. 2009). A complex of nascent human PSMD1 (Rpn2), PSMD4 (Rpn10), PSMD14 (Rpn11),
  ADRM1 (Rpn13), and TXNL1 may exist attached to the 20S core particle (20S CP) before
  the formation of the 19S RP (Hendil et al. 2009). In the study of human 19S RP assembly,
  it was shown that PSMD4 (Rpn10) levels were decreased in the absence of either the
  base subunits or the lid subunit PSMD3 (Rpn3), suggesting that PSMD4 (Rpn10) is
  stabilized only when both the base and the lid are integrated into 19S RP (Kaneko
  et al. 2009). '
