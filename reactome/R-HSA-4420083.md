stable_id: R-HSA-4420083
display_name: PTK2 binds p-S-SHB and is recruited to p-6Y-VEGFR2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SHB binds focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1; also known as PTK2) via its PTB
  domain in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. This regulates FAK1 phosphorylation,
  leading to Src dependent enhanced cell spreading (Holmqvist et al. 2003). During
  vascular development, FAK1 is involved in the control of endothelial cell migration
  (Holmquist et al. 2004), vascular permeability (Chen et al. 2012) and tube formation
  (Bohnsack & Hirshi, 2003).
