display_name: Removal of the second glucose by glucosidase II
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A second glucose is removed from the N-linked glycan. The removal of an alpha1,3
  glucose moiety is catalyzed by glucosidase II, a complex composed of an alpha subunit
  (GANAB) with catalytic activity and a beta subunit (GLU2B; PRKCSH), probably with
  regulatory and recruitment function (Pelletier MF et al, 2000). GANAB can exist
  in two different isoforms, but both are able to catalyze both of the reactions catalyzed
  by glucosidase II (Pelletier MF et al, 2000).  Defects in PRKCSH are a cause of
  polycystic liver disease (PCLD).
