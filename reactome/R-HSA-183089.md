display_name: CBL binds and ubiquitinates phosphorylated Sprouty
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Sprouty is ubiquitinated by CBL in an EGF-dependent manner. EGF stimulation
  induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of Sprouty, which in turn enhances the interaction
  of Sprouty with CBL.The CBL-mediated ubiquitination of Sprouty targets the protein
  for degradation by the 26S proteosome.
