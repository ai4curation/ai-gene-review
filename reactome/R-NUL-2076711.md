display_name: rDll1 binds NOTCH1 in cis
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mammalian cell lines were constructed that allow for independent modulation
  of the levels of cis- and trans-Delta and quantitative monitoring of the transcriptional
  response of a Notch reporter gene (Citrine fluorescent protein cDNA fused to a Notch
  responsive promoter). Cell lines stably expressed recombinant human NOTCH1 and contained
  a DNA encoding a doxycycline-inducible recombinant rat Dll1 (cis-Dll1). Cell lines
  were grown on plates containing different concentrations of adsorbed recombinant
  Dll1 (trans-Dll1). In the absence of cis-Dll1 (no doxycycline added), NOTCH1 activation
  is proportional to the concentration of trans-Delta. Induction of cis-Dll1 expression
  blocks NOTCH1 activation, and the response to cis-Dll1 is sharp and switch-like
  (Sprinzak et al. 2010).

## Summary

Mammalian cell lines were constructed that allow for independent modulation of the levels of cis- and trans-Delta and quantitative monitoring of the transcriptional response of a Notch reporter gene (Citrine fluorescent protein cDNA fused to a Notch responsive promoter). Cell lines stably expressed recombinant human NOTCH1 and contained a DNA encoding a doxycycline-inducible recombinant rat Dll1 (cis-Dll1). Cell lines were grown on plates containing different concentrations of adsorbed recombinant Dll1 (trans-Dll1). In the absence of cis-Dll1 (no doxycycline added), NOTCH1 activation is proportional to the concentration of trans-Delta. Induction of cis-Dll1 expression blocks NOTCH1 activation, and the response to cis-Dll1 is sharp and switch-like (Sprinzak et al. 2010).
