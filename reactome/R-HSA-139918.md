display_name: Phosphorylation of BIM by JNK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'MAPK8 (JNK) phosphorylates BCL2L11 (BIM) on a DLC-binding motif (DKSTQTP),
  involved in dynein (DYNLL2 i.e. DLC1) binding and sequestration of BCL2L11 (BIM)
  to the cytoskeleton. Phosphorylated BCL2L11 dissociates from dynein. Three sites
  in BCL2L11 match the JNK consensus: S44, T56 and S58 in BCL2L11 isoform BimL (these
  residues correspond to S104, T116 and S118 in BCL2L11 isoform BimEL), and all sites
  appear to be phosphorylated by MAPK8 (JNK) both in vitro and in vivo (Lei and Davis
  2003). '
