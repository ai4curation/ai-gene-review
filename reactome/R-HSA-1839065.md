display_name: Phosphorylation of cytosolic FGFR1 fusion dimers
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After ligand-independent dimerization, FGFR1 fusions are trans-autophosphorylated
  on tyrosine residues (see for instance Popovici, 1998; Ollendorff, 1999; Guasch,
  2000).  Although the sites of tyrosine phosphorylation have not been mapped in the
  context of the fusion proteins, at least some of the same residues appear to be
  phosphorylated as in full length FGFR1. For instance, phospho-specific antibodies
  have demonstrated that TRIM24 is phosphorylated on Y653 and Y654, the activation
  loop tyrosines of FGFR1 (Belloni, 2005).  Likewise, FGFR1 fusions with ZMYM2, BCR,
  FGFR1OP and TRIM24 all result in recruitment and phosphorylation of PLCgamma, and
  where mutational studies have been performed, mutation of the PLCgamma binding site
  Y766 has been shown to abrogate this signaling (Roumiantsev, 2004, Lelievre, 2008,
  Chase, 2007). In the case of BCR-FGFR1, the BCR moiety of the fusion protein has
  also been shown to be phosphorylated on at least one tyrosine residue, Y177, which
  results in the recruitment of GRB2 (Roumiantsev, 2004).
