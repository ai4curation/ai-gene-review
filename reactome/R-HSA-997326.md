display_name: Dephosphorylation of p-STAT1 dimer by nuclear isoform of TCPTP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The nuclear isoform of T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) referred
  as TC45 (or TC-PTPa) dephosphorylates p-STAT1 dimer in the nucleus. It can also
  dephosphorylate p-JAK1/3 in IFNG stimulated cells.
