stable_id: R-HSA-353125
display_name: 26S proteosome degrades ODC holoenzyme complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The rapid turnover of ODC is brought about by the 26S proteasome. Proteolytic
  processing of ODC is highly unusual in that ubiquitination is not required for this
  degradation. Instead, a non-covalent association with antizyme directs ODC to the
  proteasome. Antizyme increases the degradation of ODC by enhancing its interaction
  with the proteasome (Wu et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2003).
