stable_id: R-HSA-430158
display_name: p-SLP-76 binds VAV
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'SLP-76 is a hematopoietic cell-specific adapter protein. Studies indicate
  that three phosphotyrosines in SLP-76 (Y113, Y128, and Y145) are required for interactions
  with the SH2 domains of Vav1 (and Nck and Itk). This interaction is essential for
  membrane recruitment of Vav1. Similarly, association of Vav3 with SLP-76 was found
  to be essential for membrane recruitment. Vav2 has been shown to interact with SLP-76
  in resting Jurkat cells. '
