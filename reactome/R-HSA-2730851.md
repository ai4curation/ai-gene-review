display_name: Phosphorylation of SLP-76 by p-SYK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'SLP-76 lacks intrinsic catalytic activity and acts as a scaffold, recruiting
  other proteins for correct localization during molecular signal transduction (Bogin
  et al. 2007). Activation of FCERI leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Gross
  et al. 1999). SLP-76 has three potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites within its
  amino terminus region: Y113, Y128, and Y145. Phosphorylation may be mediated by
  SYK, analogous to the role of ZAP-70 in phosphorylating T-cell SLP-76 (Bubeck-Wardenberg
  et al. 1996).'

## Summary

SLP-76 lacks intrinsic catalytic activity and acts as a scaffold, recruiting other proteins for correct localization during molecular signal transduction (Bogin et al. 2007). Activation of FCERI leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Gross et al. 1999). SLP-76 has three potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites within its amino terminus region: Y113, Y128, and Y145. Phosphorylation may be mediated by SYK, analogous to the role of ZAP-70 in phosphorylating T-cell SLP-76 (Bubeck-Wardenberg et al. 1996).
