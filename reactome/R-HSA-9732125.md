stable_id: R-HSA-9732125
display_name: SOX2 binds the MITF promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SOX2 is a transcriptional repressor that is present on the promoter of the
  MITF gene in neural crest cells prior to melanocyte fate specification. With FOXD3,
  SOX2 represses MITF expression and promotes instead the development of the Schwann
  cell precursor fate (Adameyko et al, 2012). Although the mechanisms for lifting
  SOX2-mediated repression in the melanocyte cell line are not known, once expressed,
  MITF itself represses further SOX2 expression (Adameyko et al, 2012; reviewed in
  Mort et al, 2015; Goding and Arnheiter, 2019).
