summary: UVSSA stabilizes ERCC6 (CSB) during transcription-coupled nucleotide excision
  repair (TC-NER) by targeting ubiquitin protease USP7 to ubiquitinated ERCC6, thus
  preventing proteasome-mediated degradation of ERCC6. Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive
  syndrome (Nakazawa et al. 2012, Schwertman et al. 2012, Zhang et al. 2012, Fei and
  Chen 2012).

## Summary

UVSSA stabilizes ERCC6 (CSB) during transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) by targeting ubiquitin protease USP7 to ubiquitinated ERCC6, thus preventing proteasome-mediated degradation of ERCC6. Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive syndrome (Nakazawa et al. 2012, Schwertman et al. 2012, Zhang et al. 2012, Fei and Chen 2012).
