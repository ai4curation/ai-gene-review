stable_id: R-HSA-1912363
display_name: MIR200B/C microRNAs bind NOTCH1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Translation of NOTCH1 mRNA is inhibited by microRNAs miR-200B and miR-200C,
  which bind to the 3'UTR of NOTCH1 mRNA. Levels of miR-200B and miR-200C are decreased
  in pancreatic cancer cells with an EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition) phenotype,
  and the EMT phenotype is reversed by exogenous overexpression of miR-200B/C microRNAs,
  suggesting that miR-200B and mir-200C may be acting as tumor suppressors.
