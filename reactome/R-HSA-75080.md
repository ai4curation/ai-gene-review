summary: U12-type AT-AC introns are distinguished from the major U2-type introns by
  the consensus sequences of their highly conserved splicing signals. U12 introns
  have the 5' ss consensus sequence (G/A)TATCCTTT, the branchpoint sequence TTTCCTTAACT
  and the 3' ss (C/T)AG. Initial recognition of AT-AC introns involves interaction
  of U12 snRNP with the branch-point sequence and U11 with the 5' ss. Unlike the major
  splicing pathway, U11 and U12 are in a complex and interact with the pre-mRNA simultaneously,
  binding in an ATP-dependent manner as a di-snRNP complex and likely bridging the
  5' ss and 3' ss region.<p>Twenty proteins have been identified in the U11/U12 di-snRNP
  complex including the snRNP Sm proteins B’, B, D3, D2, D1, E, F, and G which are

  SF3b is also found in the U11/U12 di-snRNP, including p14, a protein that interacts
  with the branchpoint adenosine.<p>SR proteins are required for formation of A complex
