display_name: CFTR transports Cl- from cytosol to extracellular region
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a low conductance
  chloride-selective channel that mediates the transport of chloride ions in human
  airway epithelial cells which plays a key role in maintaining homoeostasis of epithelial
  secretions in the lungs. Defects in CFTR can cause cystic fibrosis (CF; MIM:602421),
  a common generalised disorder in Caucasians affecting the exocrine glands. CF results
  in an ionic imbalance that impairs clearance of secretions, not only in the lung,
  but also in the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract and liver (Riordan et al. 1999,
  Ousingsawat et al. 2011).
