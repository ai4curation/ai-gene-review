species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Fibulins are a family of 7 extracellular calcium binding proteins that have
  developmental roles (Twal et al. 2001). Fibulins 1-5 are found in association with
  elastic fibers. Fibulin-1 binds fibronectin (Balbona et al. 1992, Tran et al. 1997)
  suppressing fibronectin-mediated inhibitory effects on cell attachment and spreading
  (Twal et al. 2001). Fibulin-2 also binds fibronectin (Sasaki et al. 1995). '
