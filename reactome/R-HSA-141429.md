display_name: Inactivation of APC/C via CDC20 sequestration
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the sequestration model, the Mad2  molecules that dissociate from unattached
  kinetochores are perceived to bind to Cdc20, a protein that recruits specific substrates
  to the APC/C. Consequently, Mad2 indirectly inhibits the APC/C by sequestering its
  activator, Cdc20. This requires interaction between Mad1 and Mad2. Cdc20 and Mad1
  bind to the same site on Mad2.

## Summary

Consequently, Mad2 indirectly inhibits the APC/C by sequestering its activator, Cdc20. This requires interaction between Mad1 and Mad2. Cdc20 and Mad1 bind to the same site on Mad2.
