## Summary

Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR (M1M2)) catalyzes the reduction of adenine, guanine, cytidine, and uridine ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates (NDPs) to form the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates, coupled to the oxidation of thioredoxin (Eklund et al. 2001). The enzyme complex is cytosolic (Pontarin et al. 2008). The form of ribonucleotide reductase annotated here is a tetramer of two large (M1) and two small (M2) subunits (Zhou et al. 2005). Expression of RNR (M1M2) is confined to the S phase of the cell cycle by restriction of the expression of the M2 gene and by degradation of the M2 gene product at the end of S phase (reviewed by Nordlund and Reichard 2006).
