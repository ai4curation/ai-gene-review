display_name: TRAF6 binds to p75NTR:NRIF
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon neurotrophin stimulation, p75NTR interacts with the ubiquitin 3 ligase
  TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6). It is unclear whether TRAF6 binds to p75NTR
  directly, or whether it needs to be recruited through an adaptor protein such as
  MyD88.Recruitment of NRIF and TRAF6 to p75NTR is followed by an interaction between
  the two cytoplasmic proteins, It is possible that the NRIF:TRAF6 interaction promotes
  formation of a multimeric signalling complex. TRAF6 appears to  promote NRIF release
  from p75NTR
