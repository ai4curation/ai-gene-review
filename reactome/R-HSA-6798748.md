display_name: Exocytosis of secretory granule lumen proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Secretory vesicles provide a reservoir of secreted proteins and membrane-associated
  receptors that are required at the earliest stages of the neutrophil-mediated inflammatory
  response. They are mobilized in response to a wide variety of inflammatory stimuli
  (Sengelov et al. 1993a,b). Resultant cell surface changes allow the neutrophil to
  establish firm contact with activated vascular epithelium (Faurschou & Borregaard
  2003).
