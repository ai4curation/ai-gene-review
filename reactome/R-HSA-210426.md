display_name: Glutamate synaptic vesicle docking and priming
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Docking occurs once the synaptic vesicle has moved from the cytoplasm to
  a region apposed to the plasma membrane. The vesicle is held in close apposition
  to the plasma membrane by several proteins that bridge the synaptic vesicle to the
  plasma membrane. Some of these proteins are in the plasma membrane while others
  are in the synaptic vesicle. Vesicle fusion is preceded by a priming event where
  molecular interactions between the docked vesicle and the plasma membrane undergo
  changes. The molecules in the docking and the priming process are known, however,
  the exact sequence and the precise molecular changes involved in docking and priming
  are not well dissected. In this reaction the process of docking and priming has
  been condensed. It is known that Munc18 along with its interactors is critical for
  membrane docking and fusion events while Munc 13 along with its interacting proteins
  is central to priming. Munc 13 could act as a positive regulator for the priming
  recation. Finally the primed fusion complex is clamped in the pre-fusion form by
  a Complexin. Complexins are Ca2+ independent cytosolic proteins that bind to partly
  or fully assembled SNARE complexes. Complexins play both a positive and a negative
  role in the release process.
