display_name: Dual mechanism MAPK inhibitors bind MAPKs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'A number of ''dual mechanism'' MAPK inhibitors are in preclinical or clinical
  trials (reviewed in Roskoski, 2019). Dual mechanism inhibitors, including the ATP-competitive
  inhibitors SCH772984 and MK-8353, bind to the unphosphorylated MAPK and prevent
  both its own kinase activity and its phosphorylation by MAP2Ks (Morris et al, 2013;
  Deng et al 2014; Chaikuad et al, 2014; Boga et al, 2018; Moschos et al, 2019; reviewed
  in Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014). MAPK inhibitors offer the potential to mitigate
  the development of resistance to RAF and MAP2K inhibitors, which often involves
  reactivation of MAPK-dependent signaling. As a result, MAPK inhibitors are frequently
  used in combination with RAF and MAP2K-directed therapeutics (reviewed in Samatar
  and Poulikakos, 2014; Roskoski, 2019). '
