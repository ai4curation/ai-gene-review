## Summary

KEAP1:CUL3:RBX1-mediated degradation of NFE2L2 is relieved in the presence of oxidative or electrophilic stress, allowing NFE2L2 to translocate to the nucleus to support expression of target genes. NFE2L2 'inducers' are a varied group of endogenous and extracellular chemicals, including a number of pharmaceutical compounds approved for clinical use (reviewed in Cuadrado, 2019; Baird and Yamamoto, 2020). 
The mechanism by which NFE2L2:KEAP1 complex senses the oxidative stress and triggers NFE2L2 nuclear localization is unclear. It has been proposed that KEAP1, which is rich in reactive cysteines, may directly sense the oxidative stress via thiol modification and undergo conformational changes that stabilize NFE2L2 (Itoh et al. 1999). The reactive cysteine residues within KEAP1 undergo oxidation and form an intramolecular disulfide bond. Human KEAP1 has 27 cysteine residues and among those C257, C273, C288 and C297 are most reactive and can be oxidized. C273 of one KEAP1 molecule probably forms an intermolecular disulfide bridge with C288 of a second KEAP1 molecule (Zhang & Hannink 2003, Wakabayashi et al. 2004; reviewed in Baird and Yamamoto, 2020).
