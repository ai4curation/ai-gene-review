display_name: Melanocortin receptors bind melanocortins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Melanocortins are a group of pituitary peptide hormones that include corticotropin
  (ACTH) and the alpha, beta and gamma melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH) derived
  from the prohormone proopiomelanocortin (Takahashi H et al, 1981). Melanocortins
  can act through multiple melanocortin receptors (MC1R-MC5R) (Mountjoy KG et al,
  1992). The majority of melanocortin receptors (MC1R, MC3R, MC4R and MC5R) are semi-selective
  in their ability to bind multiple melanocortins (MSH and ACTH). MSH regulates pigmentation.
