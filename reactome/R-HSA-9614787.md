display_name: MPZ gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MPZ is the most abundant component of the myelin sheath that surrounds axons
  of the peripheral nervous system. Expression of MPZ is dependent on axonal signals
  that stimulate the binding of transcriptional regulators EGR2 and SOX10 to response
  elements in intron 1, where they recruit SMARCA4 to the gene (Le Blanc et al, 2006;
  Le Blanc et al, 2007; Jones et al, 2007; Marathe et al, 2013). SOX10 additionally
  binds to elements in the promoter of MPZ, where it regulates both basal and upregulated
  MPZ expression (Peirano et al, 2000).
