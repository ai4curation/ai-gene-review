display_name: Formation of Cyclin B:Cdc2 complexes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cyclin-dependent kinases are themselves catalytically inactive due to the
  fact that their active site is blocked by a portion of the Cdk molecule itself.
  Binding to their corresponding cyclin partner results in conformational change that
  partially exposes the active site. The two B-type cyclins localize to different
  regions within the cell  and and are thought to have specific roles as CDK1-activating
  subunits (see Bellanger et al., 2007). Cyclin B1 is primarily cytoplasmic during
  interphase and translocates  into the nucleus at the onset of mitosis (Jackman et
  al., 1995; Hagting et al., 1999). Cyclin B2 colocalizes with the Golgi apparatus
  and contributes to its fragmentation during mitosis (Jackman et al., 1995; Draviam
  et al., 2001).
