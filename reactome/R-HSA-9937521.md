stable_id: R-HSA-9937521
display_name: TRMT61B methylates adenosine-185 of MT-CO2 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRMT61B methylates the N1 position in adenosine residues of tRNA (Chujo and
  Suzuki 2012) and mRNA (Li et al. 2017). TRMT61B methylates the adenosine-185 residue
  of the MT-CO2 mRNA. N1-methyladenosine in mitochondrial mRNA appears to cause ribosome
  stalling that results in reduced translation (Li et al. 2017). TRMT61B forms large
  homooligomeric complexes that are presumed to contain homotetramers (Chujo and Suzuki
  2012, also PDB 2B25).
