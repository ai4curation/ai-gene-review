display_name: Loss of C-Nap-1 from centrosomes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The centrosomal protein C-Nap1 is thought to play an important role in centrosome
  cohesion during interphase (Fry et al.,1998). At the onset of mitosis, when centrosomes
  separate to form the  bipolar spindle, C-Nap1 dissociates (Mayor et al.,  2000).  Dissociation
  of C-Nap1 from mitotic centrosomes appears to be regulated by  phosphorylation (Mayor
  et al. 2002).
