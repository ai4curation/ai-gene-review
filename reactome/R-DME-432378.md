summary: After Timeless (TIM) levels drop when it is degraded by the 26S proteasome,
  the F-box domain containing protein Jetlag (JET) binds to cryptochrome (CRY), facilitating
  its ubiquitination and marking it for processing by the 26S proteasome.  In this
  model for the Circadian Clock pathway we are assuming that the cytoplasmic and nuclear
  mechanisms for CRY degradation are the same.

**Species:** Drosophila melanogaster

## Summary

After Timeless (TIM) levels drop when it is degraded by the 26S proteasome, the F-box domain containing protein Jetlag (JET) binds to cryptochrome (CRY), facilitating its ubiquitination and marking it for processing by the 26S proteasome.  In this model for the Circadian Clock pathway we are assuming that the cytoplasmic and nuclear mechanisms for CRY degradation are the same.
