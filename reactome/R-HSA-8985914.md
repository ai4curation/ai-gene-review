display_name: IL9:IL9R:JAK1:IL2RG:JAK3 phosphorylates JAK3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK3 (JAK3) is believed to become phosphorylated
  after IL9:IL9R interaction as this is thought to be a mechanism common to all receptors
  that incorporate IL2RG (Haan et al. 2011). There is no clear evidence for JAK1 phosphorylation
  by IL9 treatment, except in pathological states (Hornakova et al. 2009,  Gordon
  et al. 2010).<br><br>This is a black box event because phosphorylation of JAK3 is
  inferred from the signaling mechanism of the related IL2 receptor (Johnston et al.
  1994).
