display_name: Syndecans 2, (4) bind TGFB1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Syndecans have attached heparan sulfate (HS) and to a lesser extent chondroitin
  sulfate (CS) chains. These allow interactions with a large number of proteins, including
  transforming growth factor-Beta (Chen et al. 2000, Ishiguro et al. 2002). Various
  enzymes involved in post-translational HS chain modifications produce unique binding
  motifs that selectively recognize different proteins (Tkachenko et al. 2005). HS
  chains facilitate interactions of syndecan-1 with extracellular matrix proteins,
  including fibronectin (Saunders & Bemfield 1988, Woods et al. 2000), vitronectin,
  several types of collagen (type I, III and V Koda et al. 1985), and thrombospondin-1
  (Sun et al. 1989, Yoneda & Couchman 2003). It is thought that syndecans often act
  in concert with other receptors, e.g. alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins cooperate
  with syndecan-1 during adhesion to vitronectin (Beauvais et al. 2004, McQuade et
  al. 2006)  while alpha2beta1 and alpha6beta4 integrins cooperate with syndecans
  during adhesion to laminin (laminin alpha-1 Hozumi et al. 2006, laminin gamma-2,
  Ogawa et al. 2007). The relationship between syndecans and co-receptors is not well
  understood (Alexopoulou et al. 2007). Syndecan-null mice have subtle phenotypes
  when compared with mice deficient in HS chain synthesis or modification (Echtermeyer
  et al. 2001, Ishiquro et al. 2001, Götte et al. 2002). GPI-anchored glypicans and
  matrix HSPGs such as perlecan may compensate for the absence of syndecans. Syndecans
  are also signalling molecules, interacting with cytoplasmic proteins. Most of the
  work done has involved syndecan-4 (Multhaupt et al. 2009). Zebrafish and murine
  syndecan-4 V regions bind the membrane lipid  phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate
  (PtdIns4,5P2) undergoing a shape change revealed by NMR spectroscopy (Whiteford
  et al. 2008). The resulting complex is able to bind protein kinase C alpha which
  is persistently activated in the absence of Ca2+ (Oh et al. 1997, Lee et al. 1998,
  Keum et al. 2004). Syndecan-2 binds the kinase Ca2+/calmodulin associated serine/threonine
  kinase (CASK), a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) associated with intercellular
  junctions (Hsueh et al. 1998). Trafficking protein particle complex subunit 4 (TRAPPC4)
  is a syndecan-2 interacting protein also known as synbindin. It appears to be involved
  with postsynaptic membrane trafficking (Ethell et al. 2000). Syndecan-2 expression
  promotes dendritic spine maturation in neurons, and requires the C2 domain (Ethell
  et al. 2000), suggesting that syndecan-2 and synbindin recruit intracellular vesicles
  to postsynaptic sites. More recently TRAPPC4 was shown to be a component of the
  Transport Protein Particle, involved in endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport
  (Fan et al. 2009). The V-region of syndecan-4 interacts with the actin-bundling
  protein alpha-actinin (Greene et al. 2003, Choi et al. 2008, Shin et al. 2012),
  a direct link to the cell cytoskeleton.
