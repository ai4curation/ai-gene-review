species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the absence of stress HSF1 is predominantly monomeric and is thought to
  be repressed in its inactive monomeric state by the following mechanisms:<ul><li>
  interaction with chaperone proteins such as HSP90 (Zou J et al.1998; Guo Y et al.
  2001)</li><li>intramolecular coiled-coil interactions between a hydrophobic leucine
  zipper domain in the carboxyl-terminus of the protein and three amino-terminal leucine
  zippers, which are required for homotrimerization and transcriptional activation
  (Rabindran SK et al. 1993; Zuo J et al. 1995)</li><li>post-translation modifications
  that include protein acetylation, sumoylation and phosphorylation may also contribute
  to HSF1 repression (Knauf U et al. 1996; Hietakangas V et al. 2003; Batista-Nascimento
  L et al. 2011)</li></ul>The accumulation of misfolded proteins upon proteotoxic
  stresses leads to the release of HSF1 from the HSP90-containing multichaperone complex
  and results in HSF1 self-association to form homotrimers (Baler R et al. 1993).
  There is also evidence showing that HDAC6 senses the accumulation of misfolded,
  ubiquitinated protein aggregates in cells and induces dissociation of a repressive
  HDAC6:HSF1:HSP90 complex and subsequent HSF1 activation (Boyault C et al. 2007).
