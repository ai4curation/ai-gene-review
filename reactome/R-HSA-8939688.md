stable_id: R-HSA-8939688
display_name: SCF(SKP2) complex binds RUNX2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF binds RUNX2 through direct interaction
  between SKP2 subunit of the SCF complex and RUNX2 (Thacker et al. 2016). This process
  is inhibited by glucose uptake in osteoblasts (Wei et al. 2015).
