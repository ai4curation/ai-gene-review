summary: 'The complex of plasma membrane-associated LRP2 (megalin, glycoprotein 330)
  and LDLRAP1 (Low density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein 1, also known as ARH,
  Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia protein) bound to transcobalamin2 complexed
  with cobalamins (TCN2:RCbl) is endocytosed into clathrin-coated vesicles (Nagai
  et al. 2003). LRP2:LDLRAP1 then dissociates from TCN2:RCbl and returns to the plasma
  membrane (Shah et al. 2013) while TCN2:RCbl is targeted to lysosomes where TCN2
  is degraded and RCbl is released. LRP2, a member of the low density lipoprotein
  receptor family, is present in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (Kounnas et
  al. 1995, Hjalm et al. 1996, Moestrup et al. 1996). This process both prevents loss
  of RCbl into the urine and preserves the pool of free RCbl in kidney cells that
  is used to maintain normal levels of RCbl in the body.
