stable_id: R-HSA-5357432
display_name: AXL binds SRC-1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AXL/UFO (Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO) is a member of the TAM (Tyro3/Axl/Mer)
  family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). AXL has been implicated in angiogenesis
  because of its ability to promote angiogenically related cellular responses in endothelial
  cells (Holland et al, 2005). AXL is required for VEGFA-dependent activation of PI3K.
  Activated Src family kinases recruit AXL via its juxtamembrane domain and thereby
  trigger ligand-independent autophosphorylation of AXL that promotes association
  with PI3K and activation (Ruan & Kazlauskas 2012).
