display_name: Dimerization of FGFR2 ligand-independent mutants
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Point mutations in FGFR2 that are thought to promote ligand-independent dimerization
  in the context of autosomal bone development disorders have also been identified
  in endometrial, ovarian, gastric and lung cancer (Greenman, 2007; Dutt, 2008; Davies,
  2005; Byron, 2008; Byron, 2010, Pollock, 2007).  Although functional studies on
  these mutations in FGFR2 in cancer cell lines is limited - only the S267P mutation
  identified in gastric cancer has been demonstrated biochemically to undergo ligand-independent
  dimerization (Anderson, 1998) - characterization of paralogous mutations in FGFR3
  as well as in other mutations that create unpaired cysteine residues in FGFR2 support
  the notion that these mutant receptors undergo aberrant intermolecular disulphide
  bond formation that results in constitutive activation (Galvin, 1996; Neilson and
  Friesel,1995; Robertson, 1998; d'Avis, 1998)
