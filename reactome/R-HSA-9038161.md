display_name: Progesterone stimulation promotes PGR:P4 binding to ESR1:ESTG
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In addition to being a target of estrogen-dependent transcription, the progesterone
  receptor (PGR) interacts directly with ER alpha after stimulation with progesterone
  and modulates ESR1:ESTG binding (Ballare et al, 2003; Mohammed et al, 2015). Progesterone
  stimulation under estrogen-rich conditions promotes the release of PGR from the
  chaperone complex to facilitate interaction with ESR1 (Mohammed et al, 2015; reviewed
  in ).
