display_name: AHR:TCDD:2xHSP90AB1:AIP:PTGES3 translocates from cytosol to nucleoplasm
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After ligand binding and activation, the AHR complex translocates to the
  nucleus by an unknown mechanism (Beischlag et al. 2008) but it has been hypothesised
  that ligand binding to AHR promoted p23-associated hsp90 complex-mediated interaction
  of AHR with the nuclear import receptor protein pendulin and subsequent nuclear
  translocation of the receptor (Kazlauskas et al. 2001).
