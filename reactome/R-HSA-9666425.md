stable_id: R-HSA-9666425
display_name: p-6Y-SYK phosphorylates VAV1,2,3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: VAV proteins exist in an auto-inhibitory state folded in such a way as to
  inhibit the GEF activity of its DH domain. This folding is mediated through binding
  of tyrosines in the acidic domain to the DH domain and through binding of the CH
  domain to the C1 region. Activation of VAV may involve at least three different
  events to relieve this auto-inhibition. Phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the
  acidic domain causes them to be displaced from the DH domain, binding of a ligand
  to the CH domain may cause it to release the C1 domain and binding of PIP3 to PH
  domain may alter its conformation. VAV1 is phosphorylated on Y174 in the acidic
  domain, and this is mediated by Syk and Src-family tyrosine kinases. Once activated,
  VAV1 is then involved in the activation of RAC and CDC42 downstream of FCGR.
