display_name: Glycophorins bind plasmodium falciparum Ags
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Red blood cell (RBC) glycophorins are integral membrane proteins that are
  rich in sialic acids. They carry blood group antigenic determinants and serve as
  ligands for viruses, bacteria, and parasites. They are used as markers to study
  normal and pathological differentiation of erythroid tissue. RBC glycophorins include
  glycophorins A (GPYA) to E and are divided into two groups. GPYA and GPYB carry
  MN and Ss blood group antigens and may act as receptors for Plasmodium falciparum
  (Cartron & Rahuel 1992). GPYA and GPYB are recognized by P. falciparum erythrocyte-binding
  antigen 175 (EBA-175) (Wanaguru et al. 2013) and erythrocyte-binding ligand 1 (EBL-1)
  (Mayer et al. 2009), respectively. GLYC codes for the Gerbich (Ge) blood group antigens
  and is a receptor for P. falciparum invasion, recognizing EBA-140 on the surface
  of merozoites (Maier et al. 2003).
