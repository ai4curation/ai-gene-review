display_name: ESRP1 and 2 bind FGFR2 pre-mRNA to promote FGFR2b maturation and expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Expression of FGFR2 IIIb splice variant is characteristic of epithelial cells.  A
  number of cis-acting elements have been identified in the FGFR2 pre-mRNA that are
  required for correct expression of the IIIb isoform and repression of the mesenchymal
  IIIc form (Muh et al, 2002; Hovhannisyan and Carstens, 2005; Hovhannisyan et al,
  2006).  These include the ISAR and ISE/ISS elements 1-3 in the region between exon
  8 and exon 9 of the pre-mRNA.  ESRP1 and ESRP2 are RNA-binding mRNA splicing factors
  that promote epithelial-specific IIIb splicing by binding to the ISE/ISS-3 sequence
  (Warzecha et al, 2009).  A complex of RBFOX2, hnRNPH1 and hnRNPF may cooperate with
  the ESRP proteins to stimulate IIIb-specific splicing by binding to adjacent exonic
  GGG motifs (Baraniak et al, 2006; Mauger et al, 2008). This RBFOX2-hnRNP complex
  appears to compete with the IIIc-promoting trans-acting factor ASF/SF2 for binding
  to these exonic sites (Mauger et al, 2008). Other factors that appear to contribute
  to IIIb-specific splicing include hnRNPM, TIA1 and TIAL1, although their precise
  roles remain to be elucidated (Hovhannisyan and Carstens, 2007; Del Gatto-Konczak
  et al, 2000; Newman et al, 2006).

## Summary
