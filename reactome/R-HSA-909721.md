display_name: Translocation of ISGF3 complex to nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The resultant ISGF3 trimeric complex then migrates to the nucleus and binds
  to interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs). IRF9 is the DNA binding part
  of this ISGF3 complex. These ISREs are present in the promoters of a subset of ISGs
  (interferon stimulated genes), such as promyelocytic leukemia (PML), ISG15 ubiquitin-like
  modifier (ISG15), interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (ISG54)
  and interferon alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) to elicit an antiviral response.
