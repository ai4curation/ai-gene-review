display_name: Binding of ERCC1:ERCC4 (ERCC1:XPF) to pre-incision complex in TC-NER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ERCC1:ERCC4 (ERCC1:XPF) DNA endonuclease complex binds to the pre-incision
  complex at the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) site to
  form the incision complex. Binding of ERCC5 (XPG) to the NER site precedes the recruitment
  of ERCC1:ERCC4 (Riedl et al. 2003). ERCC1 directly interacts with the XPA, and this
  interaction is necessary for the loading of ERCC1:ERCC4 to the open bubble structure
  in damaged dsDNA and the progression of TC-NER (Tsodikov et al. 2007, Orelli et
  al. 2010).
