summary: 'CTNNA1 (alpha-catenin) is responsible for the recruitment of F-actin polymers

## Summary

CTNNA1 (alpha-catenin) is responsible for the recruitment of F-actin polymers to the CDH1 complex (Watabe-Uchida et al. 1998: human colon carcinoma cell line; Wu et al. 2015: human epidermoid carcinoma cell line; Morales-Camilo et al. 2024: canine MDCK cell line; reviewed in Zhang et al. 2023). CTNNA1 can dimerize when clustered, which increases its binding affinity for F-actin (reviewed in Zhang et al. 2023).
