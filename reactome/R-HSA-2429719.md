display_name: MCPH1 sequesters condensin II
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MCPH1 (microcephalin) binds condensin II complex through direct interaction
  with NCAPG2 and possibly NCAPD3 condensin II subunits (Wood et al. 2008, Yamashita
  et al. 2011). MCPH1 binding sequesters condensin II by preventing loading of condensin
  II on chromatin. Simultaneous binding of MCPH1 to the SET oncogene may contribute
  to condensin II sequestering (Leung et al. 2011). Mutations in MCPH1 are a cause
  of microchephaly inhereted in an autosomally recessive manner. MCPH1 deficient cells
  show premature chromosome condensation (PCC) phenotype, with metaphase-like chromosomes
  apparent in prophase, before nuclear envelope breakdown (Wood et al. 2008).

## Summary

MCPH1 (microcephalin) binds condensin II complex through direct interaction with NCAPG2 and possibly NCAPD3 condensin II subunits (Wood et al. 2008, Yamashita et al. 2011). MCPH1 binding sequesters condensin II by preventing loading of condensin II on chromatin. Simultaneous binding of MCPH1 to the SET oncogene may contribute to condensin II sequestering (Leung et al. 2011). Mutations in MCPH1 are a cause of microchephaly inhereted in an autosomally recessive manner.
