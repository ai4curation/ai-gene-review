stable_id: R-HSA-452122
display_name: JAK1 phosphorylates Y338, Y392 and Y510 of IL2RB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Following stimulation by IL2, the IL2R beta chain become phosphorylated on
  multiple tyrosine residues. These phosphotyrosine residues recruit position-specific
  signaling or adaptor proteins, leading to the activation of downstream signaling
  pathways.  Although multiple kinases are involved in the phosphorylation of IL-2R
  beta, JAK1-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosines 338, 392 and 510 is known to be
  involved in STAT protein binding (Gaffen et al. 1996). Phospho-tyrosine 338 has
  also been shown to participate in recruitment and subsequent phosphorylation of
  the adaptor Shc (Friedmann et al. 1996).   N.B. Numbering in the literature is based
  on the mature peptide, with the 26 residue signal peptide removed. Positions given
  in this reaction refer to the canonical Uniprot sequence, e.g. 338 is equivalent
  to 364 of the canonical sequence P14784.
