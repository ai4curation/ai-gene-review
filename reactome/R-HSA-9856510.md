display_name: STARD7 transports Q10 to plasma membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cytosolic STARD7 is a lipid carrier that is required for transport of Q10H2
  between inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. This isoform results from cleavage
  of further 12 amino acids from the miochondrial isoform (Deshwal et al., 2023; reviewed
  in Guile et al., 2023).
