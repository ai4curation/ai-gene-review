display_name: Ubiquitinated TP53 translocates to the cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, TP53 is exported from the nucleus to the
  cytosol. TP53 nuclear export requires the nuclear export sequence (NES) of TP53,
  but not the NES of MDM2 (Boyd et al. 2000. Geyer et al. 2000).

## Summary

Upon MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, TP53 is exported from the nucleus to the cytosol. TP53 nuclear export requires the nuclear export sequence (NES) of TP53, but not the NES of MDM2 (Boyd et al. 2000. Geyer et al. 2000).
