stable_id: R-HSA-2161999
display_name: 12S-HpETE is reduced to 12S-HETE by GPX1/2/4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) (Bryant et al. 1982, Sutherland et al. 2001),
  2 (GPX2) (Chu et al. 1993), and 4 (Bryant et al. 1982, Sutherland et al. 2001) are
  involved in converting 12S-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (12S-HpETE) to 12S-hydro-eicosatetraenoic
  acid (12S-HETE).  GPXs are selenoenzymes that are responsible for reducing the cellular
  peroxide.  Cellular GPXs compete with hepoxilins A3 (HXA3) synthase for 12S-HpETE
  as substrate either to produce 12S-HETE or to convert to HXA3, respectively.
