stable_id: R-HSA-8945709
display_name: miR-20 microRNAs bind PTEN mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNAs miR-20a-5p and miR-20b-5p, encoded by MIR20A and MIR20B genes,
  respectively, bind the 3'UTR of PTEN mRNA and downregulate PTEN mRNA translation
  (Poliseno et al. 2010, Tay et al. 2011). miR-20a-5p downregulates both PTEN mRNA
  and protein levels and is thus considered to function as part of the endonucleolytic
  RISC, but it may also function as a part of nonendonucleolytic RISC (Poliseno et
  al. 2010). miR-20b presumably functions in a similar manner (Tay et al. 2011).
