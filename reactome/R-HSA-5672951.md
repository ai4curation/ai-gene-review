display_name: Inactive RAFs bind YWHAB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In quiescent cells, RAF is maintained in a closed state in which the N-terminal
  regulatory region sterically blocks the catalytic region (Cutler et al, 1998; Tran
  et al, 2003; Terai et al, 2005; Tran et al, 2005; reviewed in Udell et al, 2011).  This
  closed state is mediated in part by the intramolecular binding of YWHAB/14-3-3 dimers
  to two phosphorylated serine residues (S259 and S621 in RAF1, S214 and S582 in ARAF
  and S365 and S729 in BRAF) (Ory et al, 2003; Jaumot et al, 2001; Fischer et al,
  2009; reviewed in Udell et al, 2011).<br><br>
