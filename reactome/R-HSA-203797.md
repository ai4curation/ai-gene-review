stable_id: R-HSA-203797
display_name: ERKs are inactivated by dual-specific phosphatases (DUSPs)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Over 10 dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) active on MAP kinases are known.
  Among them, some possess good ERK docking sites and so are more specific for the
  ERKS  (DUSP 3, 4, 6, 7), others are more specific for p38MAPK (DUSP1 and 10), while
  others do not seem to discriminate. It is noteworthy that transcription of DUSP
  genes is induced by growth factor signaling itself, so that these phosphatases provide
  feedback attenuation of signaling.  Moreover, differential activation of DUSPs by
  different stimuli is thought to contribute to pathway specificity.
