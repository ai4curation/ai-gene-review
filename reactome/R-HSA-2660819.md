display_name: NOTCH1 t(7;9)(NOTCH1:M1580_K2555) does not bind DLL1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NOTCH1 t(7;9)(NOTCH1:M1580_K2555) mutant, which results from fusion of NOTCH1
  intron 24 with the promoter of T-cell receptor TCRB, lacks extracellular EGF repeats
  involved in ligand binding and is not able to bind DLL1 (Ellisen et al. 1991).
