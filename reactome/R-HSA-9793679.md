summary: Ligation of TNF-α to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) induces the formation of the
  TNFR1 signaling complex composed of TNFR1, TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain),
  TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor-2), RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serin/threonine
  protein kinase 1), and E3 ubiquitin ligases BIRC2, BIRC3 (cIAP1/2, cellular inhibitor
  of apoptosis) and LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex) (Micheau O and
  Tschopp J 2003). The conjugation of K63-linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains by BIRC2/3
  to RIPK1 allows further recruitment and activation of the TAK1 (also known as MAP3K7)
  complex and IκB kinase (IKK) complex which in turn drives activation of NF-kappa-B
  (Ea CK et al. 2006; Haas et al. 2009). The catalytic activity of LUBAC, composed
  of HOIL-1L, HOIP, and SHARPIN, specifically generates Met1-linked (also known as
  linear) polyUb chains (Kirisako T et al. 2006; Walczak H et al. 2012; Rittinger
  K & Ikeda F 2017; Fuseya Y & Iwai K 2021). UBE2L3 functions as E2-conjugating enzyme
  for LUBAC (Lewis MJ et al. 2015; Fu B et al. 2014). LUBAC was shown to catalyze
  Met1-linked ubiquitination of RIPK1 at K627 upon co-expression of Flag-RIPK1 with
  Myc-tagged components of LUBAC (HOIP, HOIL1, and SHARPIN) in human embryonic kidney
  293T (HEK293T) cells (Tu H et al. 2021). Linear ubiquitination of mouse Ripk1 on
  K612 (K627 in human) inhibited TNF-α–induced apoptosis and necroptosis in mouse
  embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. Mutagenesis analysis further confirmed the importance
  of the K627 (K612 in mouse) ubiquitination site of RIPK1 in the TNFR1 signaling
  pathway (Li X et al. 2020). Further, LUBAC is known to ubiquitinate IKBKG (NEMO),
  a regulatory component of the IKK complex. LUBAC-mediated IKBKG ubiquitination enhanced
  IKBKG interaction with the TNFR1 signaling complex and stabilized this protein complex
  to promote activation of NF-kappa-B (Haas TL et al. 2009). Importantly, deletion
  of the LUBAC component SHARPIN in mice or mutation of HOIL-1 in humans, lead to
  hyperinflammatory phenotypes, indicating key roles of LUBAC and linear Ub chains
  in the response to infection and inflammation (Gerlach B et al. 2011; Ikeda F et
