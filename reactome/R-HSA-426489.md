display_name: RISC binds inexactly matching target RNAs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RISCs can bind target RNAs that do not exactly match the guide RNA carried
  by an Argonaute. Binding is especially dependent on base-pairing between the target
  RNA and the eight 5' nucleotides of the guide RNA (miRNA or siRNA). After binding,
  Argonaute-1 (AGO1, EIF2C1), AGO3 (EIF2C3), and AGO4 (EIF2C4) are incapable of cleavage
  in all cases. AGO2 is capable of cleaving the target RNA but not if mismatches exist
  in the middle of the guide (centered about 10 nucloetides from the 5' end of the
  guide RNA). In the absence of cleavage the target RNA remains bound by the RISC,
  which inhibits translation of the target RNA and causes the RNA  to enter the decay
  pathway. In vivo, inhibition of translation requires interaction of AGO with a TNRC6
  protein and MOV10. The phosphoinositide-3 kinase/mTOR pathway increases expression
  of GW182, a TNRC6 protein, which increases the portion of AGO:miRNA in high molecular
  weight complexes with mRNA.

## Summary

After binding, Argonaute-1 (AGO1, EIF2C1), AGO3 (EIF2C3), and AGO4 (EIF2C4) are incapable of cleavage in all cases.
