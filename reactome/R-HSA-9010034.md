stable_id: R-HSA-9010034
display_name: ADAM10:Zn2+:TSPANs cleaves APP(18-770)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10) has been identified as the
  major physiological alpha-secretase in neurons (Lammich et al. 1999, Kuhn et al.
  2010), responsible for cleaving amyloid precursor protein (APP(18-770)) in a non-amyloidogenic
  manner and producing APPs-alpha (APP(18-687), a neuroprotective APP-derived peptide
  (Mockett et al. 2017, Endres & Deller 2017). This cleavage also produces a cellular
  fragment, C83/CTF-alpha (APP(688-770). Cleavage by alpha-secretase at the cell surface
  is the major pathway in APP processing, accounting for 80–90% of APP turnover.
