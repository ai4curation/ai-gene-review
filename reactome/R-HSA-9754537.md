display_name: SARS-CoV-2 3a tetramer binds to VPS39 within HOPS complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SARS-CoV-2 viroporin 3a (ORF3a) is a membrane protein that translocates to
  the cellular membranes. Coexpression of viral 3a with markers for endolysosomal
  compartments in HeLa revealed that 3a also localizes to the late endosome and/or
  lysosome. On late endosomes/lysosomes, viral 3a inhibits autophagosomal flux (Miao
  G et al. 2021; Zhang Y et al. 2021). In in vitro GST-pull-down assays, viral 3a
  directly interacted with VPS39, a component of the homotypic fusion and protein
  sorting (HOPS) complex (Miao G et al. 2021). Moreover, the viral 3a protein co-immunoprecipitated
  with VPS39 upon co-expression of the tagged proteins in human embryonic kidney 293T
  (HEK293T) and cervical cancer HeLa cells (Miao G et al. 2021; Zhang Y et al. 2021).
  Affinity purification using HEK 293T/17 cells coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS)
  analysis further confirmed the interaction between viral 3a and VPS39 (Gordon DE
  et al. 2020). In human cells, the binding of 3a to VPS39 blocked the interaction
  of the HOPS complex with autophagosomal STX17, which is essential for autophagosome-lysosome
  fusion (Miao G et al. 2021). Further, SARS-CoV-2 3a expression in HEK293T resulted
  in the accumulation of the autophagy-associated factor MAP1LC3B (Stukalov A et al.
  2021). The impact of 3a on autophagosomal flux was further confirmed by the pathway-enrichment
  analysis which showed that the 3a-mediated inhibition of autophagic flux leads to
  the accumulation of autophagy receptors (SQSTM1, GABARAPL2, NBR1, CALCOCO2, MAP1LC3A,
  MAP1LC3B and TAX1BP1) (Stukalov A et al. 2021). Although 3a proteins are highly
  conserved between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 3a was
  found to be unable to interact with the HOPS complex and showed no effect on autophagy
  response (Miao G et al. 2021).<p>This Reactome event describes the interaction of
  SARS-CoV-2 3a (ORF3a) with human VPS39 within the HOPS complex. This interaction
  prevents the autophagosome-lysosome fusion.
