  between the Exocyst proteins EXOC3 on the granule membrane and EXOC4 on the plasma
  membrane. Exocytosis is accomplished by interaction between SNARE type proteins
  Syntaxin 1A and Syntaxin 4 on the plasma membrane and Synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 on the
  granule membrane. Exocytosis is a calcium dependent process due to interaction of
