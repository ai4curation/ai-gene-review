## Summary

DNA polymerase beta (POLB) cannot excise oxidatively damaged 5' AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) dideoxyribose residue (5'ddRP) at the APEX1-generated single strand break (SSB). Instead, POLB incorporates the first nucleotide (dNMP) at the 3' end of the SSB, which displaces 5'ddRP (Podlutsky et al. 2001).
