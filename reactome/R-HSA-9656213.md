display_name: RAF1 mutants show enhanced heterodimerization with BRAF
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Mutations in RAF1 are common in RASopathies such as Noonan Syndrome, Costello
  Syndrome, LEOPARD Syndrome and others, and also occur at low frequency in some cancers
  (reviewed in Rauen, 2013; Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014). Germline mutations of RAF1
  cluster in three regions: conserved region 2 (CR2) surrounding phosphorylation site
  S259, the activation segment, or conserved region 3 (CR3). Mutations in CR2 abrogate
  binding with 14-3-3 proteins and relieve this inhibitory interaction, increasing
  the downstream signaling presumably through increased availability of RAF1 for heterodimerization
  with BRAF (Kobayashi et al, 2010; Pandit et al, 2007; Razzaque et al, 2007; Krauthammer
  et al, 2015). Increased heterodimerization with BRAF has also been demonstrated
  for RAF1 proteins with mutations in CR3 and the activation domain, including for
  RAF1 mutants with decreased or absent kinase activity (Pandit et al, 2007; Wu et
  al, 2012).'

## Summary

Mutations in RAF1 are common in RASopathies such as Noonan Syndrome, Costello Syndrome, LEOPARD Syndrome and others, and also occur at low frequency in some cancers (reviewed in Rauen, 2013; Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014). Germline mutations of RAF1 cluster in three regions: conserved region 2 (CR2) surrounding phosphorylation site S259, the activation segment, or conserved region 3 (CR3). Mutations in CR2 abrogate binding with 14-3-3 proteins and relieve this inhibitory interaction, increasing the downstream signaling presumably through increased availability of RAF1 for heterodimerization with BRAF (Kobayashi et al, 2010; Pandit et al, 2007; Razzaque et al, 2007; Krauthammer et al, 2015). Increased heterodimerization with BRAF has also been demonstrated for RAF1 proteins with mutations in CR3 and the activation domain, including for RAF1 mutants with decreased or absent kinase activity (Pandit et al, 2007; Wu et al, 2012).
