display_name: 14-3-3 proteins beta and zeta bind and inhibit Rap1Gap2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAP1GAP2 binds 14-3-3 proteins beta and zeta, inhibiting its GAP activity
  for Rap1. This effect is diminished by Ser-7 phosphorylation of RAP1GAP2 by cGMP-
  and cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG and PKA respectively), which inhibits the
  binding of 14-3-3 proteins beta and zeta to Rap1GAP2. 14-3-3 binding does not appear
  to alter the GTPase-activating function of Rap1GAP2 in vitro, but attenuates Rap1GAP2
  mediated inhibition of cell adhesion (Hoffmeister et al. 2008).
