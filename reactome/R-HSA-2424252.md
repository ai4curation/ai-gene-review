display_name: COMP binds collagen, fibronectin, aggrecan and matrilins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP, thrombospondin-5) is a 524-kDa
  pentameric glycoprotein expressed primarily in cartilage, tendon, ligament and synovium.
  In adult cartilage, COMP is located primarily in the inter-territorial matrix between
  chondrocytes (Murphy et al. 1999). The mature protein is pentameric with each monomer
  linked to its neighbour by a disulphide bond, located at the amino terminus of the
  protein (Hedbom et al. 1992,  Morgelin et al. 1992). COMP binds directly to collagen
  types I, II and IX (Rosenberg et al. 1998, Thur et al. 2001) at the fibril periphery.
  In addition it binds fibronectin (FN1) (Di Cesare et al. 2002), matrilins 1, 3 and
  4 (Mann et al. 2004), and through the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulphate and chondroitin
  sulphate to aggrecan (Hauser et al. 1996, Chen et al. 2007).<br>Mutations in COMP
  lead to pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (Jackson et al. 2012).
  COMP binding to FN1 and probably to other partners requires the presence of the
  divalent cations Ca2+, Mg2+ or Mn2+. Each COMP subunit binds approximately 10 calcium
  ions (Chen et al. 2000).
