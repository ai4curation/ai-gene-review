display_name: Activation of GIRK/Kir3 Channels
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Binding of G beta gamma activates the GIRK/Kir3 channels that allow the efflux
  of K+ out of the cell resulting in a hyperpolarized membrane potential. This negative
  membrane potential prevents the activation of voltage dependent Ca2+ channels.

## Summary

Binding of G beta gamma activates the GIRK/Kir3 channels that allow the efflux of K+ out of the cell resulting in a hyperpolarized membrane potential. This negative membrane potential prevents the activation of voltage dependent Ca2+ channels.
