display_name: STAT binds to the mutant PDGFRA receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Like the WT receptor, gain-of-function missense and in-frame deletion mutants
  of PDGFRA appear to act through the STAT signaling pathway. Binding and phosphorylation
  of SRC and subsequently STAT1 and 3 has been demonstrated for the activation loop
  D842V mutant, the juxtamembrane domain V561D mutant and for a small number of short
  in-frame deletion mutants in the kinase and juxtamembrane domain region. Specificity
  for interaction with different STAT family members is likely to vary depending on
  the PDGFRA mutation (Heinrich et al, 2003; Velghe et al, 2014; reviewed in Klug
  et al, 2018; Wang et al, 2016; Corless et al, 2011).
