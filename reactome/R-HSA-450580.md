stable_id: R-HSA-450580
display_name: AUF1 (hnRNP D0) is ubiquitinylated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AUF1 is ubiquitinated at unknown sites. The number of ubiquitin molecules
  conjugated to AUF1 and their linkage is unknown. Ubiquitination is required for
  subsequent degradation of both AUF1 and the mRNA bound by AUF1. It is uncertain
  if AUF1 is in a larger complex when it is ubiquitinated.
