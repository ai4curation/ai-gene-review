display_name: NPC transports Hikeshi:HSP70s:ATP from cytosol to nucleoplasm
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Protein Hikeshi (C11orf73) is a nuclear import carrier protein for heat-shock
  70 proteins (HSP70s) in response to heat-shock stress. C11orf73-bound HSP70s bind
  to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) which transports the complex from the cytosol
  to the nucleoplasm where HSP70s can counteract heat shock-induced damage (Kose et
  al. 2012). NPC does not transport ADP-bound HSP70s.

C11orf73-bound HSP70s bind to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) which transports the complex from the cytosol to the nucleoplasm where HSP70s can counteract heat shock-induced damage (Kose et al. 2012). NPC does not transport ADP-bound HSP70s.
