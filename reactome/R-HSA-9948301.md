display_name: ZNF598 K63 polyubiquitinates RPS10 (eS10) and RPS20 (uS10) of the 40S
  ribosomal subunit
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ZNF598, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, transfers ubiquitin from UBE2D1, UBE2D2, or
  UBE2D3 to lysine-138 and lysine-139 of 40S ribosomal subunit RPS10 (eS10) and lysine-8
  of 40S ribosomal subunit RPS20 (uS10) (Juszkiewicz and Hegde 2017, Sundaramoorthy
  et al. 2017, Garzia et al. 2017, Juszkiewicz et al. 2018, Narita et al. 2022, Miścicka
  et al. 2024, also inferred from yeast homologs in Matsuo et al. 2017, Ikeuchi et
  al. 2019). Ubiquitination of collided ribosomes appears to be more efficient than
  ubiquitination of single ribosomes, however, collision is not required for ubiquitination
  (Miścicka et al. 2024). ZNF598 produces linkages between lysine-63 (K63) and terminal
  carboxyl residues of ubiquitin monomers (Narita et al. 2022, Miścicka et al. 2024).
  The K63-linked polyubiquitin serves as a scaffold for binding other proteins, in
  this case the ASCC2 subunit of the RQT complex (ASCC2:ASCC3:TRIP4).
