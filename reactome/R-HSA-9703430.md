stable_id: R-HSA-9703430
display_name: FLT3 fusions:GRB2 bind SOS1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated FTL3 fusion mutants have been shown to signal through the MAP kinase
  pathway as assessed through increased levels of phosphorylated ERK/MAPK proteins
  (Grand et al, 2007; Vu et al, 2009; Troadec et al, 2017; Chonabayashi et al, 2013;
  reviewed in Kazi and Roonstrand, 2019). The RAS guanine nucleotide exchange factor
  (GEF) SOS1 is presumed to be recruited downstream of GRB2 binding to FLT3 fusion
  protein, but this has not been directly demonstrated.
