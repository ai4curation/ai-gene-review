stable_id: R-HSA-158925
display_name: plasminogen:histidine-rich glycoprotein -> plasmin + histidine-rich
  glycoprotein (uPA [two-chain] catalyst)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Plasminogen, tethered to the cell surface by its association with histidine-rich
  glycoprotein, is rapidly cleaved and activated to plasmin by the action of urokinase
  plasminogen activator(two-chain form)  bound to uPAR, its cell-surface receptor.
  The association of both substrate and enzyme with the cell surface is necessary
  for the reaction to proceed efficiently (Ellis et al. 1989, 1991).

## Summary

Plasminogen, tethered to the cell surface by its association with histidine-rich glycoprotein, is rapidly cleaved and activated to plasmin by the action of urokinase plasminogen activator(two-chain form)  bound to uPAR, its cell-surface receptor. The association of both substrate and enzyme with the cell surface is necessary for the reaction to proceed efficiently (Ellis et al. 1989, 1991).
