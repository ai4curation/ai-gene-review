display_name: PSMD11 binds PSMD7:PSMD12:PSMD13:PSMD14
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PSMD11 (ortholog of yeast Rpn6) binds the PSMD7:PSMD12:PSMD13:PSMD14 complex
  (orthologous to the yeast complex Rpn8:Rpn5:Rpn9:Rpn11) to form the Module 1 subcomplex
  of the proteasome 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) lid (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasse
  2013). Binding of human PSMD11 (Rpn6) to the human lid subcomplex composed of PSMD12
  (Rpn5), PSMD7 (Rpn8), PSMD13 (Rpn9), and PSMD14 (Rpn11) was confirmed in human embryonic
  kidney cell line HEK293T (Bai et al. 2019). PSMD11 (Rpn6) likely stabilizes the
  interaction of PSMD14 (Rpn11) with the heterotrimer of PSMD12 (Rpn5), PSMD7 (Rpn8)
  and PSMD13 (Rpn9) (Bai et al. 2019).
