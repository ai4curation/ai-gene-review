summary: 'Activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) stimulates the formation
  of complex that consists of TNFR1, TNFR-associated via death domain (TRADD), RIPK1,
  TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (BIRC2/3 also
  known as cIAP1/2). TRAF2 and BIRC (cIAP1) were found to form a complex in solution
  (Zheng et al. 2010), suggesting that TNFR1:TRADD:RIPK1 receptor complex recruits
  the TRAF2:BIRC complex. Following TNF-α stimulation, RIPK1 is promptly K63-ubiquitinated
  at Lys377 residue by E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as BIRC2/3, to allow recruitment
  of the TAB2:TAK1 complex, the LUBAC and the IKK complex and eventually to stimulate
  the canonical NFkB activation. '

## Summary

Activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) stimulates the formation of complex that consists of TNFR1, TNFR-associated via death domain (TRADD), RIPK1, TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (BIRC2/3 also known as cIAP1/2). TRAF2 and BIRC (cIAP1) were found to form a complex in solution (Zheng et al. 2010), suggesting that TNFR1:TRADD:RIPK1 receptor complex recruits the TRAF2:BIRC complex. Following TNF-α stimulation, RIPK1 is promptly K63-ubiquitinated at Lys377 residue by E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as BIRC2/3, to allow recruitment of the TAB2:TAK1 complex, the LUBAC and the IKK complex and eventually to stimulate the canonical NFkB activation.
