display_name: EXT1:EXT2 transfers GlcNAc to the heparan chain
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The EXT2 subunit of the EXT1:EXT2 complex transfers an N-acetylglucosamine
  moiety from UDP-GlcNAc to the growing heparan chain of HSPGs. Exostosin 1 and 2
  (EXT1 and 2) are dual specificity enzymes which catalyze the addition of N-acetylglucosamine
  (GlcNAc) and glucuronate (GlcA) to the GAG protein linker sequence. EXT1 and 2 form
  a heterodimer which translocates to the Golgi apparatus from the ER membrane (McCormick
  et al. 2000). Defects in EXT1 or 2 cause the hereditary bone disorders multiple
  exostoses type 1 (MIM:133700) and 2 (MIM:133701) (Wuyts et al. 1998, Bernard et
  al. 2001).
