display_name: Degradation of multiubiquitinated Cdh1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: At the beginning of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'multiubiquitinated Cdh1
  associated with APC/C' is present. At the end of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'phosphorylated
  anaphase promoting complex (APC/C)', and 3 molecules of 'ubiquitin' are present.<br><br>
  This reaction takes place in the 'nucleoplasm' and  is mediated by the 'endopeptidase
  activity' of '26S proteasome'.<br>
