stable_id: R-HSA-5218854
display_name: p-Y420-FYN is phosphorylated on S21
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FYN has multiple phosphorylation sites which can affect its kinase activity.
  Among these phosphorylation sites, serine 21 (S21) has been identified as a target
  site for protein kinase A (PKA). The phosphorylation of FYN S21 is critical for
  both FYN's tyrosine kinase activity and its focal adhesion targeting (Yeo et al.
  2007).
