display_name: Sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis is based on salvage of sphingolipids and de
  novo sphingolipid synthesis. Sphingoid-1-phosphate signalling molecules are synthesized
  through the same pathway, which starts with the transfer of a fatty acid onto serine.
  The diversity of products results from later dehydrogenation or hydroxylation of
  fatty acid moieties, as well as the usage of fatty acids of different lengths. Biosynthesis
  takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and the cytosol. Lipophilic products
  are transported to other membranes via a specialized transporter (CERT1) or the
  secretory pathway. Soluble sphingoid-1-phosphates are exported by multiple transporters
  in the plasma membrane (reviewed by Merrill 2002, Gault et al. 2010).
