display_name: p-S133-CREB1 binds MITF promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha MSH) stimulates transcription
  of MITF in developing melanocytes and in melanoma cells by promoting the cAMP-dependent
  phosphorylation of CREB1 and serine 133. Phosphorylated CREB1 binds to a CRE element
  in the MITF-M promoter as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and stimulates
  transcription of MITF (Bertolotto et al,1998; Price et al, 1998). CREB-stimulated
  transcriptional activation of the MITF-M promoter is also dependent on the upstream
  SOX10 binding site (Huber et al, 2003).
