stable_id: R-HSA-9925246
display_name: CD274 mRNA binds miR-Let7-a1 RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA-Let7a (miR-Let7a) is expressed in a wide variety of cells (microglia,
  macrophages, endothelial cells) and known to play a role in regulating aspects of
  innate immune response, autophagy and viral infection (Ueta et al., 2023, Song et
  al, 2015, Letafati et al., 2022). It regulates expression of CD274 (PD-L1) by directing
  binding to the 3’UTR of the PDL1 mRNA and inhibits its expression by inhibiting
  its translation (Chen et al., 2019 and Hong et al., 2020)
