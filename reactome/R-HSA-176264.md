species: Homo sapiens
summary: The 9-1-1 complex is a heterotrimeric ring-shaped structure that is loaded
  onto DNA by the Rad17-RFC complex. In vitro studies indicate that loading is preferred
  onto DNA substrates containing ssDNA gaps that presumably resemble structures found
  upon replication fork stalling and DNA polymerase/helicase uncoupling. The Rad17-RFC
  and 9-1-1 complexes are structurally similar to the RFC (replication factor C) clamp
  loader and PCNA sliding clamp, respectively, and similar mechanisms are thought
  to be used during loading of the 9-1-1 complex and PCNA. Upon loading, the 9-1-1
  complex can recruit Chk1 onto sites of replication fork uncoupling or DNA damage.<p>The
  purified Rad17 and Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1) complexes can form a stable co-complex
  in the presence of ATP, using Rad17-Rad9 interactions. From computer modeling studies,
  the Rad17 subunit of the complex is also proposed to interact with the C-terminus
  of Rad1, p36 with the C-terminus of Hus1, and p38 with the C-terminus of Rad9. A
  major known function of the 9-1-1 complex is to recruit Chk1 to stalled replication
  forks for activation by ATR. However, the presence of the 9-1-1 complex also alters
  the ability of Rad17 to become phosphorylated, perhaps suggesting that 9-1-1 may
  regulate the recruiment of additional ATR substrates. The 9-1-1 complex has also
  been found to interact with base excision repair factors human DNA polymerase beta,
  flap endonuclease FEN1, and the S. pombe MutY homolog (SpMYH), indicating that 9-1-1
  also plays a direct role in DNA repair.
