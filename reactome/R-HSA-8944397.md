display_name: p-T69,T71-ATF2 binds PTEN gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The transcription factor ATF2, activated downstream of stress signaling by
  p38 MAPKs, binds to ATF response elements in the PTEN gene promoter to activate
  PTEN transcription. It has not been examined whether ATF2 heterodimerization partners
  are involved in ATF2-mediated up-regulation of PTEN (Shen et al. 2006).

## Summary

The transcription factor ATF2, activated downstream of stress signaling by p38 MAPKs, binds to ATF response elements in the PTEN gene promoter to activate PTEN transcription. It has not been examined whether ATF2 heterodimerization partners are involved in ATF2-mediated up-regulation of PTEN (Shen et al. 2006).
