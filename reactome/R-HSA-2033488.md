  binding
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After aberrantly dimerizing in response to epithelially expressed ligands,
  FGFR2b S252W and P253R mutants are assumed to undergo transautophosphorylation analagous
  to both the wild-type receptor, although this has not been explicitly demonstrated.  Transformation
  of NIH 3T3 cells with the FGFR2b S252W mutant confers anchorage independent growth
  and results in increased phosphorylation of FRS2 in a manner that depends on a functional
  kinase domain (Dutt, 2008). Knock-down or chemical inhibition of other FGFR2-activating
  mutations identified in endometrial cancer cells has been shown to cause cell death
  (Byron, 2008).<br><br>
