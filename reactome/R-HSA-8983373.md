stable_id: R-HSA-8983373
display_name: p-Y-STAT3 binds p-STAT5
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is believed to
  bind Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A/5B (STAT5). IL15 stimulation
  leads to the formation of DNA binding complexes that contain STAT3 and STAT5 (Johnston
  et al. 1995, Giron-Michel et al. 2003). This is a black box event because dimer
  formation is inferred from STAT3 and STAT5 co-occurrence in DNA binding complexes.
