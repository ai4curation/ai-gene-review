species: Homo sapiens
summary: Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of AUF1 and nuclease-dependent destruction
  of AUF1-bound mRNA are coupled in an unknown way. It is possible that ubiquitinated
  AUF1 targets other members of the AUF1 and signal transduction regulated complex
  (ASTRC), such as polyA-binding protein, for degradation and this renders the mRNA
  susceptible to nucleases.

## Summary

Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of AUF1 and nuclease-dependent destruction of AUF1-bound mRNA are coupled in an unknown way. It is possible that ubiquitinated AUF1 targets other members of the AUF1 and signal transduction regulated complex (ASTRC), such as polyA-binding protein, for degradation and this renders the mRNA susceptible to nucleases.
