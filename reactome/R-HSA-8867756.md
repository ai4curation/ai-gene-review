display_name: CLASP proteins and cargo are recruited to the nascent clathrin-coated
  pit
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CLASP proteins are recruited to nascent clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) through
  interactions with AP-2 and clathrin. Although in this pathway cargo recruitment
  is depicted as occuring after the recruitment of bulk AP-2 and clathrin, a number
  of studies suggest that they are largely recruited concomitantly (Liu et al, 2010;
  reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011). Concurrent interactions with sorting signals
  in cargo cytoplasmic tails and with clathrin and/or AP-2 ensure that CLASPs and
  cargo are incorporated into the emerging CCP (Schmid et al, 2006; Edeling et al,
  2006; reviewed in Traub, 2009; Traub and Bonifacino, 2013; Kirchausen et al, 2014).
  In addition, incorporation of CLASPs and cargo may play a role in regulating the
  timing and dynamics of endocytosis (Loerke et al, 2009; Mettlen et al, 2009; Soohoo
  et al, 2013; Mettlen et al, 2010; Puthenveedu et al, 2005).
