display_name: MUS81:EME1,EME2 cleaves D-loop
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The complex of MUS81 and EME1 or EME2 acts as an endonuclease and processes
  D-loops by cleaving the sister chromatid strand complementary to the invading strand
  at the junction point. MUS81:EME2 complex has a higher catalytic activity than MUS81:EME1
  complex and, in vitro, cleaves D-loops at several other sites in addition to the
  junction point (Osman et al. 2003, Pepe and West 2014). The yeast Mus81:Eme1 (Mus81:Mms4)
  complex also acts on D-loops (Schwartz et al. 2012). '
