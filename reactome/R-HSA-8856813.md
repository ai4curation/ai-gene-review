display_name: AAK1 phosphorylates AP-2 mu subunit at T156
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'AAK1 is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates T156 of the AP2 mu2
  subunit (Olusanya et al, 2001; Conner et al, 2002; Conner et al, 2003). This phosphorylation
  is thought to stabilize the open conformation of the AP-2 complex, exposing the
  cargo-binding sites and promoting cargo capture (Ricotta et al, 2002).  AAK1 kinase
  activity is stimulated by interaction with clathrin (Conner et al, 2003; Henderson
  et al, 2007).  '
