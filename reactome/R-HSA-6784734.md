display_name: PCSK9 binds LDLR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) binds to LDLR (Low-density
  lipoprotein receptor) on the cell surface. The binding site of PCSK9 has been localized
  to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF-A) domain of the LDLR (Zhang et
  al. 2007). The complex PCSK9:LDLR is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis
  and then routed to lysosomes via a mechanism that does not require ubiquitination
  and is distinct from the autophagy and proteosomal degradation pathways. In lysosomes,
  the affinity of the interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR dramatically increases. This
  promotes the final degradation of PCSK9 and LDLR without recycling. Monoclonal antibodies
  targeting PCSK9 have been shown to markedly reduce LDL cholesterol levels and are
  a novel treatment strategy for adults with hypercholesterolemia (Navarese et al.
  2015).
