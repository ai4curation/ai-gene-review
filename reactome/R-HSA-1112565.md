display_name: Tyrosine phosphorylated IL6ST binds STAT1,STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT1 binds to IL6ST (gp130) via phosphotyrosine residues 905 and 915 within
  two YXPD recognition motifs. STAT3 can be recruited to these sites and to two additional
  sites around Y767 and Y814 that have less restricted sequence recognition requirements
  (YXXQ) (Gerhartz et al. 1996). After receptor binding, STATs are phosphorylated
  on a single tyrosine residue by JAKs (Hemmann et al. 1996).
