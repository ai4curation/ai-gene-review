display_name: IP subcomplex binds NDUFAF3, NDUFAF4, TIMMDC1 to form Intermediate 1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Complex I assembly begins with the formation of a 315kDa subcomplex, centred
  around the core subunits NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur proteins 2
  and 3 (NDUFS2 and NDUFS3) (Mckenzie & Ryan 2010, Mimaki et al. 2012, Andrews et
  al. 2013). NDUFS2 is thought to be bound to NDUFAF7 (Carilla-Latorre et al. 2010).
  Defects in NDUFS2 can cause mitochondrial complex I deficiency (MT-C1D; OMIM:252010),
  causing a wide range of clinical disorders, ranging from lethal neonatal disease
  to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders (Loeffen et al. 2001). As an initial
  part of the 315kDa subcomplex, the subunits NDUFS7, S8 and A9, together with NDUFS2
  and S3, form an evolutionarily conserved hydrogenase module as part of the Iron-Sulfur
  protein fraction (IP) subcomplex (termed Intermediate 1 here) (Mckenzie & Ryan 2010,
  Andrews et al. 2013).
