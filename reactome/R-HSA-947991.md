stable_id: R-HSA-947991
display_name: Transport of glycoproteins with Man8 (or Man9) N-glycans to the Golgi
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The LMAN1(also known as ERGIC-53)/MCFD2 complex recognizes Man8 and Man9
  N-glycans released by the Calnexin/Calreticulin cycle and mediate their transport
  to the Golgi (Nyefeler B et al, 2003; Zhang B et al, 2003). Man8 glycan transfer
  is shown here.
