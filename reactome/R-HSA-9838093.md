display_name: LONP1 binds mitochondrial matrix proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: LONP1 binds substrate proteins and degrades them using an ATP-dependent mechanism
  (Mohammed et al. 2022). The binding of proteins to LONP1 can allosterically stimulate
  its ATPase activity (inferred from bacterial Lon proteases in Waxman et al. 1986,
  Lin et al. 2016). Human LONP1 binds, unfolds, and degrades several mitochondrial
  matrix proteins (Lee et al. 2021), including oxidized aconitase in which hydrophobic
  regions are exposed (Bota and Davies 2002). However, LONP1 is unable to degrade
  aggregated oxidized aconitase (Bota and Davies 2002). Steroidogenic acute regulatory
  protein (STAR) is directed to the mitochondrial matrix for degradation by LONP1
  and other proteases (Ondrovicova et al. 2005, Granot et al. 2007). The mitochondrial
  large ribosome subunit MRPL32 is degraded by LONP1 when MRPL32 is not incorporated
  in the ribosome and hence not bound to nucleic acid (Kunova et al. 2017). Other
  ribosomal subunits appear to be similarly degraded (Kunova et al. 2017). The helicase
  TWNK (Twinkle, PEO1) is degraded by LONP1 regardless of its association with nucleic
  acid (Kunova et al. 2017). Other substrates of LONP1 may include SSBP1, MTERFD3,
  FASTKD2, and CLPX (Rendón and Shoubridge 2018).
