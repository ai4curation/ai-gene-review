display_name: AXIN mutants destabilize the destruction complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Alterations in AXIN1 have been detected in a number of different cancers
  including liver and colorectal cancer and medullablastoma, among others (reviewed
  in Salahshor and Woodgett, 2005).  Missense and nonsense mutations that disrupt
  or remove protein-protein interaction domains are common, and AXIN variants in cancers
  tend to disrupt the formation of a functional destruction complex (Satoh et al,
  2000; Taniguchi et al, 2002;  Webster et al, 2000; Shimizu et al, 2002).
