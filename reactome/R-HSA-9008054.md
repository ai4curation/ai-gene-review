display_name: IL1F10 binds IL1RAPL1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukins are immunomodulatory proteins that elicit a wide array of responses
  in cells and tissues. Interleukin 1 family member 10 (IL1F10, IL 38) is a member
  of the IL1 family (Lin et al. 2001, Bensen et al. 2001 IL1F10 is produced in Human
  apoptotic cells (Mora et al. 2016) and human epidermal keratinocytes (based on mRNA
  studies) (Boutet M A et al. 2016). Full length (1 – 152 amino acids) IL1F10 can
  bind Interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein like 1 (IL1RAPL1) (Mora et al. 2016).
  N-terminally truncated IL1F10 (20 – 152 amino acids) is also known to bind IL1RAPL1
  but with much higher affinity. The physiological significance of full length IL1F10
  binding to IL1RAPL1 is not known.
