display_name: Acyl chain remodelling of PG
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the acyl chain remodelling pathway (Lands cycle), phosphatidylglycerol
  (PG) is hydrolyzed by phopholipases and subsequently reacylated by acyltransferases.  These
  cycles modify the fatty acid composition of glycerophospholipids to generate diverse
  molecules asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane.  The events occur additionally
  in the inner mitochondria membranes (IM) as well as in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) membrane (Ghomashchi et al. 2010, Singer et al. 2002, Cao et al. 2008, Yang
  et al. 2004, Nie et al. 2010).
