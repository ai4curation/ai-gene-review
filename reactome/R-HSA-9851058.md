stable_id: R-HSA-9851058
display_name: AcK685 p-Y705, S727 STAT3 dimer and DNMT1 bind IL2RG gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT3 recruits DNMT1 to the IL2RG promoter in NPM1-ALK cells as assessed
  by chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. DNMT1-dependent
  promoter methylation contributes to repression of IL2RG gene expression. STAT3 also
  contributes to DNMT1-dependent IL2RG repression by downregulating miR-21, a known
  negative regulator of DNMT1 mRNA expression (Zhang et al, 2011).

## Summary

STAT3 recruits DNMT1 to the IL2RG promoter in NPM1-ALK cells as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. DNMT1-dependent promoter methylation contributes to repression of IL2RG gene expression. STAT3 also contributes to DNMT1-dependent IL2RG repression by downregulating miR-21, a known negative regulator of DNMT1 mRNA expression (Zhang et al, 2011).
