stable_id: R-HSA-445079
display_name: Phosphorylation of L1 by ERK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: L1 cross linking can activate MAPK cascade components MEK1/2, ERK1/2, as
  well as Src, Raf-1,and p90rsk. MAP kinase signaling requires endocytosis mediated
  by Src. ERK2 can phos-phorylate internalized L1 at serine residues 1204 and 1248.
  This phosphorylation may increase the neurite growth.
