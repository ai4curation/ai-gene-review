display_name: EGR2:NAB2 and CHD4 bind the ID2 and ID4 promoter regions
species: Homo sapiens
summary: EGR2 is required for peripheral nerve cell myelination in Schwann cells where
  it activates some target genes and represses others (Topilko et al, 1999; Zorick
  et al, 1996; Le et al, 2005; Le Blanc et al, 2005). ID2 and ID4 were identified
  as targets of EGR2-mediated repression during peripheral nerve myelination (Mager
  et al, 2008). EGR2 represses ID2 and ID4 gene expression by recruiting NAB2 and
  the NURD chromatin remodelling complex (Mager et al, 2008, Srinivasan et al, 2006).
