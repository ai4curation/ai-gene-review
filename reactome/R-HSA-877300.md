display_name: Interferon gamma signaling
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) belongs to the type II interferon family and
  is secreted by activated immune cells-primarily T and NK cells, but also B-cells
  and APC. INFG exerts its effect on cells by interacting with the specific IFN-gamma
  receptor (IFNGR). IFNGR consists of two chains, namely IFNGR1 (also known as the
  IFNGR alpha chain) and IFNGR2 (also known as the IFNGR beta chain). IFNGR1 is the
  ligand binding receptor and is required but not sufficient for signal transduction,
  whereas IFNGR2 do not bind IFNG independently but mainly plays a role in IFNG signaling
  and is generally the limiting factor in IFNG responsiveness. Both IFNGR chains lack
  intrinsic kinase/phosphatase activity and thus rely on other signaling proteins
  like Janus-activated kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK2 and Signal transducer and activator of
  transcription 1 (STAT-1) for signal transduction. IFNGR complex in its resting state
  is a preformed tetramer and upon IFNG association undergoes a conformational change.
  This conformational change induces the phosphorylation and activation of JAK1, JAK2,
  and STAT1 which in turn induces genes containing the gamma-interferon activation
  sequence (GAS) in the promoter.
