summary: 'Tyrosine protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) binds Interleukin-20 receptor subunit
  alpha (IL20RA). JAK1 coimmunoprecipitates with several class II receptor complexes
  including Interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1), Interferon alpha/beta receptor 2
  (IFNAR2), Interferon lambda receptor 1 (IFNLR1), Interleukin-10 receptor subunit
  alpha (IL10RA), Interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha 1 (IL22RA1)  and Interleukin-20
  receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA), leading to the suggestion that Class II receptors
  may have a common sequence motif for JAK recognition (Ferrao et al. 2016). This
  is a black box event because JAK1 binding to IL20RA is inferred from binding to
  related receptors and subsequent JAK/STAT signaling events (Ferrao et al 2016, Hann
  et al. 2006, Murakami et al. 1991). '
