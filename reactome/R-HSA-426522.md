stable_id: R-HSA-426522
display_name: Nonendonucleolytic RISC binds exactly matching target RNAs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RISCs containing Argonaute-1 (AGO1, EIF2C1), AGO3 (EIF2C3), and AGO4 (EIF2C4)
  bind to target RNAs by base-pairing between the target RNA and the guide RNA of
  the RISC. AGO1,3,4 do not possess ribonuclease activity therefore exact matches
  between the guide and the target do not result in cleavage of the target. Rather,
  the effect of binding is inhibition of translation followed by decay of the target
  RNA. Argonaute proteins have been shown to interact with ribosomal proteins and
  with components of processing bodies (P-bodies) where RNA degradation occurs. Direct
  interaction between AGO and a TNRC6 protein is required for inhibition of translation
  and targeting to P-bodies in vivo.
