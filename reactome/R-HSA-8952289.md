## Summary

Extracellular serine/threonine protein kinase FAM20C is an extracellular kinase that can phosphorylate a broad range of secreted protein. FAM20C is bound and allosterically activated by the pseudokinase FAM20A (Tagliabracchi et al. 2012, 2015, Cui et al. 2015). <br>Loss of function mutations in Fam20C cause Raine Syndrome, an osteosclerotic bone dysplasia (Faundes et al. 2014).
