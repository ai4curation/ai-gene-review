summary: After aberrantly dimerizing in response to mesenchymally expressed ligands,
  FGFR2c S252W and P253R mutants are assumed to undergo transautophosphorylation analagous

  cancer cells has been shown to cause cell death (Byron, 2008).

## Summary

After aberrantly dimerizing in response to mesenchymally expressed ligands, FGFR2c S252W and P253R mutants are assumed to undergo transautophosphorylation analagous to the wild-type receptor, although this has not been explicitly demonstrated.  Knock-down or chemical inhibition of other FGFR2-activating mutations identified in endometrial cancer cells has been shown to cause cell death (Byron, 2008).
