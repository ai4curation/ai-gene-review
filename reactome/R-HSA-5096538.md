display_name: Defective LFNG does not transfer GlcNAc to Pre-NOTCH
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Fringe family (CAZy family GT31) of glycosyltransferases in mammals includes
  LFNG (lunatic fringe; MIM:602576), MFNG (manic fringe; MIM:602577) and RFNG (radical
  fringe; MIM:602578). Fringe enzymes function in the Golgi apparatus where they initiate
  the elongation of O -inked fucose on fucosylated peptides by the addition of a beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyl
  group (GlcNAc) (Moloney et al. 2000). Fringe enzymes elongate conserved O fucosyl
  residues conjugated to EGF repeats of NOTCH, modulating NOTCH activity (Cohen et
  al. 1997, Johnston et al. 1997) by decreasing the affinity of NOTCH extracellular
  domain for JAG ligands (Bruckner et al. 2000).<br><br>The spondylocostal dysostoses
  (SCDs) are a group of disorders that arise during embryonic development by a disruption
  of somitogenesis. The Notch signalling pathway is essential for somitogenesis, the
  precursors of vertebra and associated musculature. Defects in one of the Fringe
  enzymes, beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase lunatic fringe (LFNG), can cause
  spondylocostal dysostosis, autosomal recessive 3 (SCDO3; MIM:609813), a condition
  of variable severity associated with vertebral and rib segmentation defects (Sparrow
  et al. 2006). The missense mutation F188L can result in SCDO3 by not being able
  to modulate Notch activity (Sparrow et al. 2006).
