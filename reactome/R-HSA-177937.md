display_name: Phosphorylation of EGFR by SRC kinase
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Besides autophosphorylation, EGFR can become tyrosine-phosphorylated by the
  action of  the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase, c-src. This Src homology
  2 (SH2) domain-containing protein is one of many such proteins which bind to phosphorylated
  sites on EGFR to affect signal transmission into the cell.
