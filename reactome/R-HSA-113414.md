display_name: 7-14 nt. Backtracking of Pol II complex on the template leading to elongation
  arrest
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RNA Pol II arrest is believed to be a result of irreversible backsliding
  of the enzyme by ~7-14 nucleotides. It is suggested that, arrest leads to extrusion
  of displaced transcripts  3'-end through the small pore near the Mg2+ ion. Pol II
  arrest may lead to abortive termination of elongation due to irreversible trapping
  of the 3'-end of the displaced transcript in the pore (reviewed by Shilatifard et
  al., 2003).

It is suggested that, arrest leads to extrusion of displaced transcripts  3'-end through the small pore near the Mg2+ ion. Pol II arrest may lead to abortive termination of elongation due to irreversible trapping of the 3'-end of the displaced transcript in the pore (reviewed by Shilatifard et al., 2003).
