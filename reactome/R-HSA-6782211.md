display_name: DNA polymerases delta, epsilon or kappa bind the TC-NER site
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The DNA repair synthesis complex, consisting of PCNA, RFC, RPA and polymerase
  delta (POLD) or epsilon (POLE) complexes, or polymerase kappa (POLK), is formed
  at the transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) site, as well as
  the global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) site, following the incision
  of the damaged DNA strand 5' to the lesion by the ERCC1:ERCC4 (ERCC1:XPF) complex.
  3' incision by XPG (ERCC5) is not required for the loading of the DNA polymerases
  and may not be required for the initiation of NER-mediated DNA synthesis (Staresincic
  et al. 2009). XPG and RPA promote the assembly of the DNA synthesis complex at the
  NER site (Mocquet et al. 2008).
