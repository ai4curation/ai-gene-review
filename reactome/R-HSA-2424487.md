display_name: Phosphorylation of PLC-gamma by p-BTK/p-SYK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Three tyrosine residues at positions 771, 783 and 1254 in PLCgamma1 have
  been identified as the sites of receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. Of these
  Y783 and Y1254 are required for PLC-gamma1 activation. <br>In myeloid cells phosphorylation
  of the tyrosine residues of PLC-gamma1 is mediated by SYK and BTK kinases (Ormsby
  et al. 2010, Kim et al. 1994, Law et al. 1996, Watanabe et al. 2001).
