display_name: First strand transfer mediated by Repeated (R) sequence
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The minus strand strong stop DNA (-sssDNA) is transferred to the 3' end of
  the HIV-1 genomic RNA, where the 3' end of the -sssDNA anneals to the viral genomic
  R sequence motif (Ghosh et al. 1995; Klaver and Berkhout 1994; Ohi and Clever 2000;
  Telesnitsky and Goff 1997). Viral NC (nucleocapsid) protein may play a role in this
  transfer (Driscoll and Hughes 2000).
