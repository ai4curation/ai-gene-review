species: Homo sapiens
summary: PAK1 kinase is a member of serine/threonine protein kinase family and is
  widely believed as mediator between Cdc42 and Rac1 and the JNK signal transduction
  pathway. PAK1 is involved in regulating FCERI mediated mast cell degranulation via
  effects on calcium mobilisation and cytoskeletal changes (Allen et al. 2009). The
  conventional PAK family contains a N-terminal conserved Cdc42/Rac-interacting binding
  domain (CRIB) that overlaps a kinase inhibitory (KI) domain and a C-terminal catalytic
  domain. PAK1 molecules form trans-inhibited homodimers in which the N-terminal kinase
  inhibitory (KI) domain of one PAK1 molecule in the dimer binds and inhibits the
  C-terminal catalytic domain of the other. Isoprenylated Rac1/Cdc42-GTP localized
  to the membrane recruits PAK1 by binding to the N-terminal CRIB domain. Binding
  of activated Cdc42/Rac1, breaks the PAK1-dimer and removes the trans-inhibition
  and stimulates serine/threonine kinase activity of that allows autophosphorylation
  (Lu & Mayer 1999, Parrini et all. 2009, Zhao et al. 2005).

## Summary

PAK1 kinase is a member of serine/threonine protein kinase family and is widely believed as mediator between Cdc42 and Rac1 and the JNK signal transduction pathway. PAK1 is involved in regulating FCERI mediated mast cell degranulation via effects on calcium mobilisation and cytoskeletal changes (Allen et al. 2009). The conventional PAK family contains a N-terminal conserved Cdc42/Rac-interacting binding domain (CRIB) that overlaps a kinase inhibitory (KI) domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. PAK1 molecules form trans-inhibited homodimers in which the N-terminal kinase inhibitory (KI) domain of one PAK1 molecule in the dimer binds and inhibits the C-terminal catalytic domain of the other. Isoprenylated Rac1/Cdc42-GTP localized to the membrane recruits PAK1 by binding to the N-terminal CRIB domain. Binding of activated Cdc42/Rac1, breaks the PAK1-dimer and removes the trans-inhibition and stimulates serine/threonine kinase activity of that allows autophosphorylation (Lu & Mayer 1999, Parrini et all. 2009, Zhao et al. 2005).
