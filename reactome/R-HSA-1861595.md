display_name: Extension of pseudopodia by myosin-X in a PI3K dependent manner
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Myosin-X (Myosin 10) is one of the downstream effectors of PI3K in FCGR-phagocytosis
  and is involved in pseudopod extension and closure of phagocytic cups. It is recruited
  to the forming phagosome by binding, through its second PH domain to membrane PIP3,
  a major product of PI3-kinase (Cox et al. 2002). Myosin-X may act as a motor to
  transport membrane cargo molecules to the forming pseudopods, influencing actin
  dynamics. It is not understood with certainty how myosin X contributes to the mechanism
  of pseudopod extension. It selectively binds to actin bundle such that each head
  may bind, in an ATP-sensitive manner, to two adjacent actin filaments within the
  actin bundle. Myosin X hydrolyze ATP and converts this chemical energy to mechanical
  energy moving toward the plus end/barbed end of the actin filament facing towards
  the tip of the growing pseudopods (Araki 2006, Chavrier 2003, Watanabe et al 2010).
