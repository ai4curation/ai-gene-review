**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

Insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS1, IRS2)  bind to activated Interleukin-7 receptor complex . Interleukin-7 (IL7) stimulation of human thymocytes results in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of  IRS1 and IRS2.

This is a black box event because the kinase responsible for IRS phosphorylation is unclear.
