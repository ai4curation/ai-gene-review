stable_id: R-HSA-380905
display_name: Serotonin loaded synaptic vesicle docking and priming
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Serotonin loaded synaptic vesicles are docked, inside the synapse in the
  presynaptic cell, close to the plasmamembrane. The docking brings the vesicles in
  close proximity to the release site to fascilitate the release of serotonin. Some
  of the molecules involved in the docking process are Munc 18, Rab3a, Rab 3 interacting
  molecule (RIM). The priming reaction brings docked but unprimed synaptic vesicles
  into a releaseable pool. Priming involes formation of the trimeric SNARE complex
  between two plasmamembrane proteins SNAP25 and Syntaxin and vesicular membrane protein,
  VAMP2.
