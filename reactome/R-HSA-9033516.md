display_name: PEX2:PEX10:PEX12:Ub:PEX5L:PEX7:PEX13:PEX14 binds PEX1:PEX6:PEX26 and
  ZFAND6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PEX1:PEX6:PEX26 (known as the Receptor Export Module) extracts ubiquitinated
  PEX5L from the peroxisomal membrane Docking and Translocation Module (Tamura et
  al. 2006, Tamura et al. 2014). PEX1 and PEX6 are soluble proteins that form a hexameric
  ring bound to PEX26 in the peroxisomal membrane (Matsumoto et al. 2003, Welle et
  al. 2005). ZFAND6 (AWP1) probably binds to ubiquitinated PEX5 and PEX6 and acts
  as an export factor (Miyata et al. 2012).
