species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATM-mediated phosphorylation of CHEK2 (CHK2, Cds1) on threonine residue T68
  promotes formation of transitional CHEK2 homodimers primarily through intermolecular
  interactions of FHA domains and phospho-T68 residues of two CHEK2 protomers (Cai
  et al. 2009).

## Summary

ATM-mediated phosphorylation of CHEK2 (CHK2, Cds1) on threonine residue T68 promotes formation of transitional CHEK2 homodimers primarily through intermolecular interactions of FHA domains and phospho-T68 residues of two CHEK2 protomers (Cai et al. 2009).
