display_name: ATF6:HSPA5 (ATF6-alpha:BiP) dissociates and HSPA5 binds unfolded protein
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATF6-alpha is a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) membrane with N-terminal cytoplasmic and C-terminal luminal domains. BiP binds
  the luminal domain of ATF6-alpha via the substrate binding domain of BiP. Binding
  of BiP blocks 2 Golgi localization sequences on ATF6-alpha, maintaining ATF6-alpha
  in the ER. <br> BiP is also a general chaperone capable of binding unfolded proteins
  in the ER lumen. When chaperone activity in the ER is overwhelmed, BiP dissociates
  from ATF6-alpha and binds the excess unfolded proteins. It is unclear whether the
  dissociation is due to competition of unfolded proteins for BiP or to a more specific
  interaction between BiP and ATF6-alpha. The dissociation exposes the Golgi localization
  sequences of ATF6-alpha and allows ATF6-alpha to transit to the Golgi.
