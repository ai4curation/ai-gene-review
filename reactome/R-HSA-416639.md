display_name: Trafficking of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors to extrasynaptic sites
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GluR2 containing AMPA receptors are trafficked to the plasmamembrane by the
  activation of Ca activated PKC that binds PICK.The  PICK interaction delivers GluR2
  containing AMPA receptors to the Plasmamembrane. This reaction is a part of constitutive
  recycling of AMPA receptor that delivers the AMPA receptors from the endosome to
  the plasmamembrane and back to endosome from the plasmamembrane.
