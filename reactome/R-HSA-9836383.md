stable_id: R-HSA-9836383
display_name: p-PKR dimer phosphorylates ILF3:ILF2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated PKR phosphorylates interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (also
  known as NF90, NFAR, DRBP76, MBP4, or ILF3) at residues T188 and T315, resulting
  in dissociation of p-ILF3 from its complex with ILF2, retaining and accumulating
  p-ILF3 in the cytosol. On viral infection, cytosolic p-ILF3 binds to viral mRNA,
  inhibiting its translation. Since ILF3 also activates PKR, both processes appear
  to be part of a feedback loop, enhancing PKR signaling (Ting et al, 1998; Patel
  et al, 1999; Harashima et al, 2010).
