species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'ORC1 is ubiquitinated by the SKP2-containing ubiquitin ligase complex and
  targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation, which may play an important role in
  the maintenace of ploidy. While the ORC1 region phosphorylated by the CCNA:CDK1
  complex is involved in the interaction with SKP2, phosphorylation may not be a pre-requisite
  for ORC1 ubiquitination (Mendez et al. 2002). '

## Summary

ORC1 is ubiquitinated by the SKP2-containing ubiquitin ligase complex and targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation, which may play an important role in the maintenace of ploidy. While the ORC1 region phosphorylated by the CCNA:CDK1 complex is involved in the interaction with SKP2, phosphorylation may not be a pre-requisite for ORC1 ubiquitination (Mendez et al. 2002).
