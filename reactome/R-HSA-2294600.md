display_name: CDK1 phosphorylates condensin II subunit NCAPD3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation of the threonine residue T1415 of condensin II subunit NCAPD3
  is required for chromosome condensation in prophase. In vivo, phosphorylation of
  NCAPD3 threonine residue T1415 is blocked when cells are treated with CDK1 inhibitors.
  In addition, it was shown that CDK1 in complex with cyclin B1 (CDK1:CCNB1) phosphorylates
  NCAPD3 at T1415 in vitro (Abe et al. 2011).
