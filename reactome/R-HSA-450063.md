display_name: 'Interleukin-2: IL2 receptor alpha:beta binds IL2 receptor gamma subunit'
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Recruitment of the IL-2R gamma chain forms a very stable quaternary complex,
  capable of signaling. The IL-2 gamma chain further retards IL-2 dissociation so
  that the rate of IL-2 dissociation from the complex is three times slower than the
  rate of internalization of the complex (t1/2 55= 45 min vs. 15 min). Therefore,
  the complex continues to signal as long as it remains on the cell surface.
