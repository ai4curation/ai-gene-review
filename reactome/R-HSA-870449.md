summary: 'TRIM33 (also known as Ecto, Ectodermin or Tif1-gamma) monoubiquitinates
  nuclear SMAD4 on lysine residue K519. This leads to disruption of heterotrimeric
  complexes composed of SMAD4 and two phosphorylated R-SMADs (SMAD2 and/or SMAD3).
  TRIM33 inhibits SMAD activity without affecting steady state levels of SMAD4 (Dupont

## Summary

TRIM33 (also known as Ecto, Ectodermin or Tif1-gamma) monoubiquitinates nuclear SMAD4 on lysine residue K519. This leads to disruption of heterotrimeric complexes composed of SMAD4 and two phosphorylated R-SMADs (SMAD2 and/or SMAD3). TRIM33 inhibits SMAD activity without affecting steady state levels of SMAD4 (Dupont et al. 2009, Dupont et al. 2005).
