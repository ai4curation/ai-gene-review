display_name: CERT1-2 transfers CERA from the ER membrane to the Golgi membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CERT1-2 (ceramide transfer protein, isoform 2), an isoform of COL4A3BP, mediates
  the non-vesicular transfer of ceramide (CERA) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  membrane to the Golgi membrane at ER-Golgi membrane contact sites. This transfer
  is essential for cellular lipid homeostasis (Kumagai & Hanada 2019; Olayioye & Hausser
  2012). CERT1-2 is associated with the cytosolic face of the ER membrane as part
  of a complex with PPM1L (protein phosphatase 1-like) (Saito et al. 2008) and VAPA
  or VAPB (VAMP-associated proteins A or B) (Kawano et al. 2006). The carboxyterminal
  START domain of CERT1-2 protein specifically binds ceramides (Hanada et al. 2003;
  Kudo et al. 2008). The PH domain of CERT1-2 can bridge the gap between the ER and
  the Golgi apparatus to transfer a CERA molecule extracted from the ER membrane to
  the Golgi (Hanada et al. 2003; Saito et al. 2008). CERT1-2-mediated ceramide transfer
  is positively regulated by OSBP (oxysterol binding protein), apparently through
  accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4P) at membrane contact sites
  (Perry & Ridgway 2006; Goto et al. 2016).
