display_name: Glucosidase II removes glucose residue from Glu2Man9GlucNAc2-CDH1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After MOGS (Glucosidase I) removes the first glucose residue from the core
  glycan, the remaining two glucose residues are removed in a two-step process catalyzed
  by the Glucosidase II complex, which consists of the catalytic subunit GANAB (Glucosidase
  II subunit alpha) and the Glucosidase II subunit beta PRKCSH (reviewed in Helenius
  and Aebi 2004). After the middle glucose residue is removed by Glucosidase II, the
  monoglucosylated (Glu1Man9GlcNAc2) glycoprotein binds to chaperones calnexin and/or
  calreticulin (reviewed in Helenius and Aebi 2004). While the processing of CDH1
  by Glucosidase II has not been specifically studied, the product expected to be
  generated by Glucosidase II in the first processing step is detectable by mass spectroscopy
  (Guo et al. 2017).
