stable_id: R-HSA-8869456
display_name: USP4 deubiquitinate TRAF2,TRAF6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: USP4 specifically interacts with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated
  factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF6 but not TRAF3. It deubiquitinates both TRAF2 and TRAF6
  in vivo and in vitro, negatively regulating TNFalpha and IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB
  activation and cancer cell migration (Xiao et al. 2012). USP25, a negative regulator
  of the virus-triggered type I IFN signaling pathway, cleaves lysine 48- and lysine
  63-linked polyubiquitin chains in vitro and in vivo from DDX58 (Retinoic acid-inducible
  gene I (RIG-I)), TRAF2, and TRAF6 to inhibit RIG-I-like receptor-mediated IFN signaling
  (Zhong et al. 2013).
