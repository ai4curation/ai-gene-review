species: Homo sapiens
summary: MAP3K5 (ASK1) phosphorylates and activates MAP2K3 (MKK3) and MAP2K6 (MKK6)
  (Ichijo et al. 1997). A conserved docking site, DVD, at the C-terminus of MAP2K3
  and MAP2K6 is needed for the interaction with MAP3K5 and MAP3K5-mediated activation
  (Takekawa et al. 2005).
