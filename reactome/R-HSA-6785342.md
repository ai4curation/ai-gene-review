display_name: FANCD2:FANCI complex and UBE2T bind ICL-DNA associated with the FA core
  complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The ID2 complex, composed of FANCD2 and FANCI, binds to branched DNA structures,
  such as stalled replication forks at DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL-DNA) (Yuan
  et al. 2009, Longerich et al. 2009, Joo et al. 2011). The ID2 complex also interacts
  with the FA core complex component FANCL, activating the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity
  of FANCL (Rajendra et al. 2014, Longerich et al. 2014). Up to fifty FANCD2 molecules
  (ID2 complexes) may be recruited per one ICL, probably spreading to surrounding
  DNA (Douwel et al. 2014). The E2 ubiquitin ligase UBE2T is recruited to ICL-DNA
  by binding to the FANCL subunit of the FA core complex independently of the ID2
  complex (Machida et al. 2006, Alpi et al. 2007, Hodson et al. 2014). '
