stable_id: R-MMU-9763891
display_name: Src family kinases phosphorylate Cbl in Csf1 dimer:p-Y559-Csf1r dimer:Cbl
species: Mus musculus
summary: Cbl binds and is phosphorylated by phosphorylated Csf1r (Tanaka et al. 1995,
  Wang et al. 1996, Husson et al. 1997, Wang et al. 1999, Xiong et al. 2011). Cbl
  is observed to bind phosphotyrosine-974 (Wilhelmsen et al. 2002) but mutation of
  tyrosine-559 has a greater effect on phosphoryation of Cbl and multiubiquitination
  of Csf1r by Cbl (Wang et al. 1999). Based on response to inhibitors, the phosphorylation
  of Cbl is catalyzed by Src family kinases (Xiong et al. 2011).
