display_name: RNA polymerase III transcribes microbial dsDNA to dsRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RNA polymerase III (POL III) was reported to sense and transcribe cytosolic
  AT-rich dsDNA into 5'-triphosphate poly(A-U) RNA in human and mouse cells. This
  dsRNA ligand in turn activated retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) leading to
  production of type I interferon and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB
  (Chiu YH et al. 2009, Ablasser A et al. 2009). Knockdown of POL III expression by
  siRNA or inhibition of its enzymatic activity by specific chemical inhibitor ML-60218
  prevented IFN beta induction in HEK293 cells stimulated with DNA viruses or poly(dA-dT)
  (Chiu YH et al. 2009, Ablasser A et al. 2009). Moreover, Pol-III inhibition blocked
  interferon induction by intracellular Legionella pneumophila bacteria [Chiu YH et
  al 2009].<p>This project represents cytosolic RNA polymerase III as a complex comprising
  17 subunits, although the precise biochemical composition of the cytosolic holoenzyme
  complex which specifically recognizes AT-rich DNA  is not yet known.
