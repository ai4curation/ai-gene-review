display_name: GPX4-2 reduces 18(S)-HpEPE to 18(S)-HEPE
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In PMNs, cytosolic phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPX4
  isoform 2, GPX4-2) (Yagi et al. 1996) is a likely candidate for the reduction of
  organic hydroperoxides such as 18(S)-HpEPE to 18(S)-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid
  (18(S)-HEPE) (Han et al. 2013) using glutathione (GSH) as an electron donor (Brigelius-Flohe
  & Maiorino 2013).
