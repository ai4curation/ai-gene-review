summary: 'CAP-GLY domain containing linker protein 3 (CLIP3 or CLIPR-59) is thought
  to function as an adaptor protein recruiting CYLD into the TNFR1 signaling to facilitate
  CYLD-mediated deubiquitination of RIPK1 in TNFalpha signaling (Fujikura D et al.
  2012). CLIP3-assisted CYLD-mediated K63-deubiquitination of RIPK1 may promote caspase-8
  activation to induce apoptosis by TNFalpha. The effects of CLIP3 (CLIPR-59) knockdown
  on apoptosis induction by TNFalpha were more effective in human cervical cancer
  HeLa cells than in human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells or human fibrosarcoma
  HT1080 cells. These findings suggest that the role of CLIP3 on TNF-alpha-induced
  and RIP1-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling is dependent on cell type and context
  (Fujikura D et al. 2012). Further, low expression levels of CLIP3 (CLIPR-59) were
  detected in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells, such as U87MG, and high grade
  glioma biopsy samples (Ding Z et al. 2015). In malignant gliomas, a negative relationship
  between overexpression of speedy protein A (SPDYA or SPY1) and CLIP3 downregulation
  was associated with a highly aggressive phenotype of glioma (Ding Z et al. 2015;
  Kang H et al. 2021). In GBM cells, CLIP3 interacted with SPDYA, resulting in decreased
  association of CLIP3 with CYLD (Ding Z et al. 2015). This in turn led to reduced
  CYLD-mediated deubiquitination of RIPK1 suppressing TNF-α-induced cell death of
  glioma cells (Ding Z et al. 2015). '
