summary: 'Co-expression of both protein O-mannosyl-transferases 1 and 2 (POMT1 and
  POMT2; CAZy family GT39) is necessary for enzyme activity (Manya et al. 2004), that

  residues of proteins such as alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1; MIM:128239). This process
  occurs in the ER lumen and both POMT isozymes are ER membrane residents. O-Mannosyl
  residues are also called M0.


  DAG1 is a cell surface protein that plays an important role in the assembly of the

## Summary

Co-expression of both protein O-mannosyl-transferases 1 and 2 (POMT1 and POMT2; CAZy family GT39) is necessary for enzyme activity (Manya et al. 2004), that is mediating the transfer of mannosyl residues to the hydroxyl group of threonine residues of proteins such as alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1; MIM:128239). This process occurs in the ER lumen and both POMT isozymes are ER membrane residents. O-Mannosyl residues are also called M0.

DAG1 is a cell surface protein that plays an important role in the assembly of the extracellular matrix in muscle, brain, and peripheral nerves by linking the basal lamina to cytoskeletal proteins. Defects in POMT2 (MIM:607439) results in defective glycosylation of DAG1 and can cause severe congenital muscular dystrophy dystroglycanopathies ranging from a severe type A, MDDGA2 (brain and eye abnormalities; MIM:613150), through a less severe type B, MDDGB2 (congenital form with mental retardation; MIM:613156) to a milder type C, MDDGC2 (limb girdle form; MIM:603158) (Bertini et al. 2011, Wells 2013). Analogously, mutations in POMT1 can lead to the muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathies MDDGA1 (MIM:236670; Beltran-Valero de Bernabe et al., 2002), MDDGB1 (MIM:613155; van Reeuwijk et al., 2006), MDDGC1 (MIM:609308; Balci et al., 2005).
