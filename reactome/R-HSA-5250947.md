display_name: B-WICH complex binds rDNA promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Active rRNA genes are bound by the B‑WICH multiprotein complex (Cavellan
  et al. 2006, Percipalle et al. 2006). B-WICH binds the promoter region of the gene
  (Percipalle et al. 2006, Sarshad et al. 2013). The MYO1C component of the B-WICH
  complex binds chromatin and interacts with SMARCA5. Binding causes 200 bp of chromatin
  at the promoter to adopt a more open configuration and contributes to epigenetic
  modifications compatible with transcription activation (Vintermist et al. 2011,
  Sarshad et al. 2013). At the rRNA gene promoter the SMARCA5-MYOIC interaction is
  excluded when MYOIC interacts with actin in complex with RNA polymerase I (Sarshad
  et al. 2013). Binding of MYOIC to chromatin is regulated by GSK3beta-dependent phosphorylation
  that targets the MYOIC chromatin binding domain (Sarshad et al. 2014). Binding of
  MYOIC to the RNA polymerase I is partly mediated via phosphorylated TIF1A (Philimonenko
  et al. 2004). Binding of B‑WICH to rRNA genes requires MYOIC to be recruited to
  active rRNA genes and this mechanism appears to be a requirement to activate and
  maintain transcription by RNA polymerase I (Percipalle et al. 2006, Sarshad et al.
  2013, Sarshad et al. 2014, reviewed in Sarshad and Percipalle 2014).
