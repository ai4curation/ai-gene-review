summary: PIAS4 SUMOylates TOP2A with SUMO2,3 (Diaz-Martinez et al. 2006, Agostinho
  et al. 2008, Impens et al. 2014, Tammsalu et al. 2014). SUMOylation is observed
  in interphase and mitosis in response to inhibitors of topoisomerase. SUMOylated
  TOP2A is localized to centromeres during mitosis.
