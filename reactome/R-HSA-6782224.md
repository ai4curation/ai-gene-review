display_name: 3' incision by ERCC5 (XPG) in TC-NER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), as well as
  in global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), the cleavage of the damaged
  DNA strand 3' to the site of damage is carried out by a DNA endonuclease XPG (ERCC5).
  While the NER-mediated DNA synthesis may be initiated prior to the 3' incision (Staresincic
  et al. 2009), the components of the incision complex probably dissociate from the
  NER site shortly after the DNA synthesis complex assembly and 3' incision (Overmeer
  et al. 2011). The exception is the RPA heterotrimer, which is a constituent of the
  NER post-incision complex, and also coats the undamaged DNA strand, thereby protecting
  it from endonucleolytic cleavage. RNA polymerase II-associated factors also remain
  bound to the TC-NER site.
