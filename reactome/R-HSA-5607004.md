display_name: Soluble PROCR binds PRTN3:CD177
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Soluble PROCR binds to activated neutrophils via PRTN3, also known as myeloblastin
  and (Leukocyte) proteinase-3 (Kurosawa et al. 2000). PRTN3 is the most abundant
  serine protease in neutrophils (Campbell et al. 2000). After neutrophil activation,
  PRTN3 is secreted from azurophil granules, rebinding to the neutrophil surface through
  an association with CD177 (NB1) a 60-kDa glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked
  cell surface glycoprotein, which is expressed on a subpopulation of neutrophils
  in 97% of healthy individuals (Knuckleburg et al. 2012). PRTN3 is partially protected
  from inactivation when associated with CD177 (Campbell et al. 2000) which may increase
  its efficacy. CD177 is a heterophilic binding partner for endothelial cell platelet-endothelial
  cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1, which is expressed at endothelial cell junctions
  where transmigration occurs (Sun et al. 2000) suggesting that  CD177 directs at
  least a subpopulation of PRTN3 molecules to these areas to aid neutrophil diapedesis,
  perhaps through PRTN3 degradation of  cell junction proteins or the extracellular
  matrix.
