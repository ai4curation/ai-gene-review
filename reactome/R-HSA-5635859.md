display_name: GLI:SUFU dissociates
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Hh signaling promotes the dissociation of the GLI:SUFU complex in the cilium
  downstream of SMO activation (Humke et al, 2010; Tukachinsky et al, 2010).  This
  appears to divert the transcription factors away from the partial processing/degradation
  pathway and allow the full-length forms to translocate to the nucleus where they
  are converted to labile transcriptional activators (Humke et al, 2010; Tukachinsky
  et al, 2010; Pan et al, 2006; Kim et al, 2009).  How the Hh signal is transmited
  from SMO to promote the dissociation of the GLI:SUFU complex is not clear, however
  it may involve changes in PKA activity as a result of lowered cAMP levels upon pathway
  stimulation. (Tukachinsky et al, 2010; Wen et al, 2010; Tuson et al, 2011; Barzi
  et al, 2010; reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013). GPR161, which localizes to
  the cilium in a TULP3-dependent manner and which increases cAMP levels in the absence
  of ligand, is cleared from the cilium upon pathway activation, and deletion of GPR161
  increases Hh-dependent signaling (Mukhopadhyay et al, 2010; Mukhopadhyay et al,
  2013).  These data suggest that removal of ciliary GPR161 upon Hh stimulation may
  contribute to pathway activity by downregulating PKA activity through cAMP levels
  (reviewed in Mukhopadhyay and Rohatgi, 2014).

## Summary

Hh signaling promotes the dissociation of the GLI:SUFU complex in the cilium downstream of SMO activation (Humke et al, 2010; Tukachinsky et al, 2010).
