stable_id: R-HSA-5626699
display_name: MARK4 binds ODF2 in the centriole
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MARK4 (microtubule associated protein/microtubule affinity regulating kinase
  4) was identified in a screen as a positive regulator of ciliogenesis (Kuhns et
  al, 2013). MARK4 interacts at the centriole with the subdistal appendage component
  ODF2 and this interaction is required to promote axonemal extension (Kuhns et al,
  2013; reviewed in Kim and Dynlacht, 2013). Like Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2), MARK4
  appears to have a role in promoting the dissociation of CCP110 and CEP97, uncapping
  the centriole and allowing axonemal extension to take place (Kuhns et al, 2013;
  Ye et al, 2014;; Goetz et al, 2012). Although this reaction shows that MARK4 is
  recruited to the centriole subsequent to TTBK2, the timing of the ODF2:MARK4 interaction
  is not known.
