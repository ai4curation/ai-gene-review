display_name: CLAT:AP1:CLVS bind PI(3,5)P2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) originating from the trans-Golgi network
  (TGN) provide a major transport pathway from the secretory system to endosomes/lysosomes.
  Clavesin 1 and 2 (CLVS1 and 2) are enriched on CCVs and form a complex with clathrin
  heavy chain (CHC) and adaptor protein-1 (AP1) complex, major coat components of
  TGN-derived CCVs. The complex can bind phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PIP2),
  a phospholipid localised to late endosomes and lysosomes. This interaction is thought
  to assist the transport of cytosolic cargo proteins to the endosomal network (Katoh
  et al. 2009).
