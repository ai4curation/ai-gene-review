display_name: Release Of ADP From Myosin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The weak binding of the myosin head to the new site on the actin filament
  causes release of the inorganic phosphate produced by ATP hydrolysis, concomitantly
  with the tight binding of the head to actin. This release triggers the power stroke,
  a force-generating change in the shape during which the head regains its original
  conformation. In the course of the power stroke, the head loses its bound ADP, thereby
  returning to the start of a new cycle.

This release triggers the power stroke, a force-generating change in the shape during which the head regains its original conformation.
