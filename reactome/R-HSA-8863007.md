display_name: p25-bound CDK5 phosphorylates CDC25B
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CDK5, activated by binding to p25 phosphorylates CDC25B protein tyrosine
  phosphatase on serine and threonine residues S50, T69, S160, S321 and S470. In neurons,
  CDK25B localizes to both nucleus and cytosol and CDK5-mediated phosphorylation does
  not change its localization. Once activated by CDK5, CDC25B promotes activation
  of CDK1, CDK2 and CDK4 (Chang et al. 2012).
