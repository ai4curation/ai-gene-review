display_name: Phosphorylated STAT5 is released
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Deletion mutants have demonstrated that STAT dimerization can occur independently
  of the binding of 2 STAT molecules by a dimeric receptor.  Although this does not
  exclude the possibility that STATs may dimerize while still associated with the
  receptor complex, dimerization is believe to occur following the release of phosphorylated
  monomers (e.g. Turkson & Jove 2000).
