display_name: Clathrin-associated PIK3C2A phosphorylates PI(4)P to PI(3,4)P2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Clathrin-associated PIK3C2A catalyzes the conversion of PI(4)P to PI(3,4)P2,
  which contributes to the recruitment of BAR domain proteins such as SNX9 to the
  clathrin-coated pit (Domin et al, 2000; Gaidarov et al, 2001; Gaidarov et al, 2005;
  Posor et al, 2013; reviewed in Daumke et al, 2014).
