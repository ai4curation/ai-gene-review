display_name: Loading of claspin onto DNA during replication origin firing
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Claspin is loaded onto DNA replication origins during replication initiation.
  Studies in Xenopus egg extracts indicate claspin loading requires the presence of
  Cdc45, a factor that promotes the initial unwinding of the origin DNA in the presence
  of Cdk2. This step is followed by RPA binding which is a prerequisite for recruitment
  of PCNA and DNA polymerases alpha and delta. As RPA is not required for claspin
  binding, it is postulated that claspin binds at the time of initial origin unwinding
  but prior to the initiation of DNA synthesis. Claspin would then continue to associate
  with replication fork machinery where it can serve as a checkpoint sensor protein.
  Even though associated with the replication fork, claspin is not an essential DNA
  replication factor.<p>Studies of Xenopus claspin indicate that it can physically
  associate with cognate Cdc45, DNA polymerase epsilon, RPA, RFC, and Rad17-RFC on
  chromatin. Studies of purified human claspin indicate that it binds with high affinity
  to branched (or forked) DNA structures that resemble stalled replication forks.
  Electron microscopy of these complexes indicates that claspin binds as a ring-like
  structure near the branch. The protein is hypothesized to encircle the DNA at these
  sites.
