species: Homo sapiens
summary: MMACHC (Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type C protein) complexed
  with cob(II)alamin (vitamin B<sub>12r</sub>) binds to MMADHC (methylmalonic aciduria
  and homocystinuria type D protein). Formation of this complex is required for the
  targeted delivery of cob(II)alamin to both cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes (Mah
  et al. 2013, Plesa et al. 2011, Deme et al. 2012). but details of the mechanisms
  involved remain unclear (Banerjee et al. 2021).<p>Defects in MMADHC cause methylmalonic
  aciduria and homocystinuria type cblD (MMAHCD; MIM:277410), a disorder of Cbl metabolism
  characterized by decreased levels of the coenzymes adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and
  methylcobalamin (MeCbl) (Coelho et al. 2008).
