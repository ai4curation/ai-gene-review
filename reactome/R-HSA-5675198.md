species: Homo sapiens
summary: BRAF is subject to MAPK-dependent phosphorylation that limits its activity.
  Phosphorylation of S151 inhibits binding of BRAF to activated RAS, while phosphorylation
  of T401, S750 and S753 abrogates heterodimerization with RAF1 (Ritt et al, 2010;

## Summary

BRAF is subject to MAPK-dependent phosphorylation that limits its activity. Phosphorylation of S151 inhibits binding of BRAF to activated RAS, while phosphorylation of T401, S750 and S753 abrogates heterodimerization with RAF1 (Ritt et al, 2010; Rushworth et al, 2006; Brummer et al, 2003).
