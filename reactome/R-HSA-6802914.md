species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAF dimerization and phosphorylation downstream of moderately activating
  BRAF mutations is associated with increased MAP2K and MAPK phosphorylation (Wan
  et al, 2004; Freeman et al, 2013; Roring et al, 2012; reviewed in Holderfield et
  al, 2014; Lavoie and Therrien, 2015).  Although the interactions between oncogenic
  RAS or RAFs and downstream effectors hasn't been studied in detail, these disease
  pathways are presumed to recruit MAP2Ks and MAPKs in a scaffold-dependent manner
  similar to WT (reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011).
