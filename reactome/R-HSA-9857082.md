stable_id: R-HSA-9857082
display_name: ATF5 and HSF1 trimer activate expression of HSPE1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: During the mitochondrial response to unfolded protein (mtUPR), a reduction
  of mitochondrial protein import causes ATF5 to accumulate in the nucleus and activate
  expression of the mitochondrial chaperone HSPE1 (HSP10) (Fiorese et al. 2016). Trimeric
  Heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1) phosphorylated on serine-326 is also required
  for expression of HSPE1 during the mtUPR Sutndy et al. 2023, inferred from mouse
  homologs in Katiyar et al. 2020).

## Summary

Trimeric Heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1) phosphorylated on serine-326 is also required for expression of HSPE1 during the mtUPR Sutndy et al. 2023, inferred from mouse homologs in Katiyar et al. 2020).
