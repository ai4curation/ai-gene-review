display_name: Prostaglandin E synthase isomerizes PGH2 to PGE2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the most abundant prostanoid in the body and is
  a major mediator of inflammation in diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid
  arthritis. The product of arachidonate, prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) serves as the substrate
  for the isomerization to PGE2. The conversion is carried out by prostaglandin E
  synthases. Of the three forms, two are predominanly cytosolic. Prostaglandin E synthase
  3 (PTGES3) is also called cytosolic prostaglandin E2 synthase (cPGES). Prostaglandin
  E synthase 2 (mPGES-2, PTGES2) is synthesized as a Golgi membrane-associated protein
  which undergoes a spontaneous cleavage of the N-terminal hydrophobic domain leading
  to a truncated mature cytosolic protein.
