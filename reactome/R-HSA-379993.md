stable_id: R-HSA-379993
display_name: arginine + tRNA(Arg) + ATP => Arg-tRNA(Arg) + AMP + pyrophosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RARS (cytosolic arginyl tRNA synthetase) catalyzes the reaction of arginine,
  tRNA(Arg), and ATP to form Arg-tRNA(Arg), AMP, and pyrophosphate. The enzyme, a
  class I tRNA synthetase, is a monomer found in the cell as a component of the mutienzyme
  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (Ling et al. 2005).
