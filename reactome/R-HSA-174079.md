display_name: Phosphorylation of Cdh1 by Cyclin A:Cdk2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: At the G1/S transition, the Cdh1 subunit of the APC:Cdh1 complex is phosphorylated
  by Cyclin A:Cdk2 and  dissociates from APC/C. This inactivates APC/C and permits
  the accumulation of cell cycle proteins required for DNA synthesis and entry into
  mitosis.
