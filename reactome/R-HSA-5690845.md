display_name: TNIPs bind TNFAIP3 (A20)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TNFAIP3-interacting protein (TNIPs), also known as A20-binding inhibitors
  of NF-kappa-B activation (ABINs), bind TNFAIP3, the ubiquitin-editing nuclear factor-kappaB
  (NF-kappaB) inhibitor protein A20 (Heyninck et al. 1999). Overexpression of TNIPs
  inhibits NF-kappaB activation by tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNIPs have a ubiquitin-binding
  domain that is essential for their NF-kappaB inhibitory and anti-apoptotic activities.
  They may function as adaptors between ubiquitinated proteins and other regulatory
  proteins, or disrupt signaling complexes by competing with other ubiquitin-binding
  proteins (Verstrepen et al. 2009).

## Summary

TNFAIP3-interacting protein (TNIPs), also known as A20-binding inhibitors of NF-kappa-B activation (ABINs), bind TNFAIP3, the ubiquitin-editing nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor protein A20 (Heyninck et al. 1999). Overexpression of TNIPs inhibits NF-kappaB activation by tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNIPs have a ubiquitin-binding domain that is essential for their NF-kappaB inhibitory and anti-apoptotic activities. They may function as adaptors between ubiquitinated proteins and other regulatory proteins, or disrupt signaling complexes by competing with other ubiquitin-binding proteins (Verstrepen et al. 2009).
