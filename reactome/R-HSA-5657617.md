display_name: ALKBH3 associated with ASCC1:ASCC2:ASCC3 binds alkylated dsDNA containing
  3-meC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ALKBH3 (ABH3) has a preference for binding single strand DNA or RNA containing
  alkylation damage. ALKBH3 associates with dsDNA containing 3-methylcytosine (3-meC-dsDNA)
  alkylation damage in the presence of ASCC3 DNA helicase. ASCC3 is a part of ASCC1:ASCC2:ASCC3
  activating signal co-integrator complex, which unwinds dsDNA, providing an appropriate
  substrate for ALKBH3 (Duncan et al. 2002, Sundheim et al. 2006, Chen et al. 2010,
  Dango et al. 2011). ALKBH3 requires iron (Fe2+) for its catalytic activity (Duncan
  et al. 2002, Sundheim et al. 2006). ALKBH3 is ~2-fold more active on DNA containing
  3-methylcytosine than 1-methyladenine (Duncan et al. 2002).
