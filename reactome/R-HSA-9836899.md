display_name: sG binds to HSPGs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The secreted soluble isoform of hRSV G protein (sG) binds to proteoglycans
  on the surface of host cells (Escribano-Romero et al, 2004). sG has been reported
  to enhance cytotoxic T-cell responses in mice, act as an antigen decoy, and modulate
  Fc-mediated antibody anti-viral activity (reviewed by Anderson et al, 2021).
