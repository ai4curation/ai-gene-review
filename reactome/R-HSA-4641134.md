stable_id: R-HSA-4641134
display_name: SMURF2 binds AXIN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SMURF2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for AXIN and promotes its ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation.  Ectopic SMURF2 immunoprecipitates both exogenously expressed and endogenous
  AXIN.  AXIN is polyubiquitinated by SMURF2 at lysine 505 both in vitro and in vivo
  (Kim and Jho, 2012).
