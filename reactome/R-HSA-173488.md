display_name: The SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex transfers to the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The phosphorylated R-SMAD:CO-SMAD complex rapidly translocates to the nucleus
  (Xu et al. 2000, Kurisaki et al. 2001, Xiao et al. 2003) where it binds directly
  to DNA and interacts with a plethora of transcription co-factors. Translocation
  of SMAD2 and SMAD3 to the nucleus is negatively regulated by ERK-mediated phosphorylation
  (Kretzschmar et al. 1999). Regulation of target gene expression can be either positive
  or negative. A classic example of a target gene of the pathway are the genes encoding
  for I-SMADs. Thus, TGF-beta/SMAD signaling induces the expression of the negative
  regulators of the pathway (negative feedback loop).

Translocation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 to the nucleus is negatively regulated by ERK-mediated phosphorylation (Kretzschmar et al. 1999). Regulation of target gene expression can be either positive or negative. A classic example of a target gene of the pathway are the genes encoding for I-SMADs.
