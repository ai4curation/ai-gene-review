display_name: p-STAT1,p-STAT3 dissociate from IL24:IL20RA:p-Y1022,Y1023-JAK1:IL20RB:p-STAT1,
  p-STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta (STAT1) dissociate
  from the Interleukin-24 (IL24)  receptor complex (Wang et al. 2002). This complex
  is formed by IL24 ligand, phosphorylated Interleukin-20 receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA),
  phosphorylated Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and Interleukin-20 receptor subunit
  beta (IL20RB) (Parrish-Novak et al. 2007). This is a black box event because dissociation
  is inferred to occur to allow STAT dimerization and translocation to the nucleus,
  as is the case for STAT3 activation by the Interleukin-10 receptor (Niemand et al.
  2003).
