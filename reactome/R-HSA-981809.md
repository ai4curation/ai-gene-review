display_name: ST6GALNAC3/4 transfers sialic acid to the sialyl T antigen to form the
  disialyl T antigen
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The human genes ST6GALNAC3 and 4 encode GalNAc alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase
  III and IV respectively which can add sialic acid (Neu5Ac) to sialyl T antigen to
  produce a disialyl T antigen. ST6GALNAC4 is characterised  (Harduin-Lepers et al.
  2000) while ST6GALNAC3 is thought to perform a similar function based on sequence
  similarity.
