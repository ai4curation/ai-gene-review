stable_id: R-HSA-110368
display_name: POLD,POLE-mediated DNA strand displacement synthesis
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Polymerase delta complex (POLD) or polymerase epsilon complex (POLE) bound
  to PCNA-associated replication complex that also includes RPA and RFC complexes,
  catalyzes DNA strand displacement synthesis in a reaction facilitated by FEN1 and
  APEX1. POLD or POLE extend the 3' end of the single strand break (SSB) by adding
  up to 10 nucleotides. The 5' end of the SSB, which contains the oxidatively damaged
  AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) dideoxyribose phosphate residue (5'ddRP) that could not
  be excised by POLB, is displaced as a flap structure by the joint action of FEN1
  and POLD or POLE (Klungland and Lindahl 1997, Stucki et al. 1998, Dianov et al.
  1999, Podlutsky et al. 2001, Ranalli et al. 2002).
