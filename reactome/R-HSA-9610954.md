stable_id: R-HSA-9610954
display_name: HCMV Final Envelopment
species: Homo sapiens
summary: As part of the HCMV Vesicle Formation Complex, Vps4 controls the release
  of ESCRT complexes from membranes. Upstream ESCRT complexes ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II
  are believed to work in parallel to recruit the cargo, whereas Vps4 and ESCRT-III
  work in series. Virus envelopment occurs by budding into endosomal vesicles, which
  fuse with the plasma membrane to release virions to the extracellular space. Accumulation
  of viral glycoproteins gM-gN and ESCRT proteins at the periphery of AC support this
  model of viral egress, where these proteins provide essential functions such as
  envelopment and endosomal budding before viral exit.
