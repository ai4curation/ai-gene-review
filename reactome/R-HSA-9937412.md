display_name: Stalled 55S mitochondrial ribosome is dissociated to yield 28S subunit
  and 39S subunit:mRNA:peptidyl-tRNA:tRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mitochondrial ribosomes that are stalled due to a defective tRNA are observed
  by cryo-EM to be dissociated into 39S and 28S subunits (Desai et al. 2020). The
  39S subunit contains a tRNA at the E site and a peptidyl-tRNA at the P site (Desai
  et al. 2020). The dissociated 39S subunit is also bound by the MALSU1:MIEF1:NDUFAB1
  complex (Desai et al. 2020), which also participates in separating the ribosomal
  subunits during translation initiation (Brown et al. 2017). The mechanism that causes
  separation of the subunits of a stalled ribosome is unknown.

The 39S subunit contains a tRNA at the E site and a peptidyl-tRNA at the P site (Desai et al. 2020). The dissociated 39S subunit is also bound by the MALSU1:MIEF1:NDUFAB1 complex (Desai et al. 2020), which also participates in separating the ribosomal subunits during translation initiation (Brown et al. 2017). The mechanism that causes separation of the subunits of a stalled ribosome is unknown.
