display_name: Active G alpha (q) binds RGS proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) sense extracellular signals and activate
  different Guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). Upon activation, GPCRs
  can replace the GDP with GTP in the alpha subunit of G proteins. GTP binding modifies
  the conformation of G alpha proteins and activates them. The Regulator of G protein
  Signalling (RGS) are GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs) that can directly inhibit
  the G alpha subunit activity. There are at least 25 different types of RGS proteins
  known. Several of these RGS proteins (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21)
  can bind and stabilize the transition state for GTP hydrolysis of Guanine nucleotide
  binding protein G(q) subunit alpha class (GNAQ/GNA11/GNA14/GNA15). Subsequently,
  this leads to GTP hydrolysis and inactivation of G alpha (q) and terminating downstream
  signalling (Neubig RR and Siderovski DP et al. 2002, Kach J et al., 2012). The primary
  function of G alpha (q) is activation of phospholipase C beta thereby triggering
  phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation.
