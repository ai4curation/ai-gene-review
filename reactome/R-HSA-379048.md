species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'G alpha q protein (or Gq/11) consists of four family members (G-alpha 11,
  -alpha 14, -alpha 15 and -alpha q). It activates phospholipase C (PLC) (Dowal L
  et al, 2006). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol (PIP2) to diacyl glycerol (DAG)
  and inositol triphosphate (IP3). DAG acts as a second messenger that activates protein
  kinase C (PKC) and IP3 can bind to IP3 receptors, particular calcium channels in
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Calcium flow causes the cytosolic concentration
  of calcium to increase, causing a cascade of intracellular changes and activity. '
