## Summary

Src and its downstream signaling molecule PLC gamma 2 are implicated in GPIb-IX-V (GPIbR) signalling. GPIbR-mediated platelet activation correlates with cytoskeletal association of Src, activation of PI3K and the appearance of multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Jackson et al. 1994). von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and the vWF modulator botrocetin induce tyrosine phosphorylation of FceRIgamma, Syk, LAT and PLCgamma2. Src kinase inhibition markedly suppresses these events (Wu et al. 2001). Src and Lyn form a complex with FceRIgamma and Syk upon GPIbR/vWF interaction (Wu et al. 2003). FcgammaRIIa was tyrosine phosphorylated upon vWF and ristocetin-induced-platelet activation, followed by Syk and PLCgamma2 activation. A selective Src kinase inhibitor inhibited these events (Torti et al. 1994).<br>
