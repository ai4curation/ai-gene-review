display_name: CTNNB1 S45 mutants aren't phosphorylated by CK1alpha
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Missense or deletion mutations at Ser45 abolish the CK1alpha phosphorylation
  site of beta-catenin, which, via its critical role in providing a priming site for
  GSK3 phosphorylation of three other residues, prevents its ubiquitin-mediated degradation
  (Morin et al, 1997; Amit et al, 2002).  S45 mutant forms of beta-catenin show enhanced
  nuclear localization, supershift TCF-DNA complexes in vitro and support enhanced
  transcriptional activity as assessed by reporter assay (Morin et al, 1997; Koesters
  et al, 2003; Laurent-Puig et al, 2003).  Nuclear accumulation of mutant beta-catenin
  is also associated with increased cell proliferation (Nhieu et al, 1999).  S45 gain-of-function
  mutants of beta-catenin have been identified in colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas,
  soft tissue cancer and Wilms Tumors, among others (reviewed in Polakis, 2000).
