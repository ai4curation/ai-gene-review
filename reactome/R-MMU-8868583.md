display_name: Cdk5:p25 phosphorylates Prdx1
species: Mus musculus
summary: In mouse neurons, Cdk5, aberrantly activated by binding to p25, inactivates
  peroxide reductase Prdx1 by phosphorylating a conserved threonine residue T90 of
  Prdx1, which contributes to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Sun et
  al. 2008).

## Summary

In mouse neurons, Cdk5, aberrantly activated by binding to p25, inactivates peroxide reductase Prdx1 by phosphorylating a conserved threonine residue T90 of Prdx1, which contributes to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Sun et al. 2008).
