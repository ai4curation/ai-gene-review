stable_id: R-HSA-9926524
display_name: MITF-M-dependent CDC25B gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CDC25B is a tyrosine protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates CDK1, stimulating
  its kinase activity and thereby promotes G2/M transition (Timofeev et al, 2010).
  By ChIP and RNAseq analysis, CDC25B has been identified as a direct target of MITF-M-dependent
  regulation (Strub et al, 2011).
