stable_id: R-HSA-5690701
display_name: SHP1 binds p-CD22
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The phosphorylated ITIMs of CD22 facilitates recruitment of the tyrosine
  phosphatase SHP1 (Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 also referred
  as PTPN6/Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 6), which down modulates
  BCR signalling (Doody et al. 1995). Activation of SHP1 regulates the strength of
  the BCR-induced Ca+2 signal. Regulation of Ca+2 signalling occurs both by dephosphorylation
  of intracellular SHP1 substrates which are important for triggering of Ca+2 signals
  (Adachi et al. 2001, Stebbins et al. 2003), as well as by a SHP1 dependent activation
  of the Ca+2 plasma membrane pump PMCA4 which controls termination of the signal
  (Muller et al. 2013, Ghosh et al. 2006).
