stable_id: R-HSA-2691226
display_name: NOTCH1 HD domain mutants bind JAG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: It has not been directly shown that JAG1 binds to and activates NOTCH1 HD
  (heterodimerization) domain mutants, but NOTCH1 HD mutants are expected to respond
  to JAG1 like they respond to DLL1 (Malecki et al. 2006).
