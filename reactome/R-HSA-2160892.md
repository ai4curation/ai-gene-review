display_name: HYAL2 hydrolyses HA into 20kDa fragments
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HYAL2 (hyaluronidase 2) hydrolyses high molecular weight hyaluronate (HA),
  initially in the form of a complex with HAR (hyaluronan receptors) and HYAL2, generating
  20kDa HA fragments fragments, HAR, and HYAL2 (Lepperdinger et al. 1998, Jedrzejas
  & Stern 2005). The acidic microenvironment required for HYAL2 activity (Bourguignon
  et al. 2004) is generated by SLC9A1 activated by CHP1 (of calcineurin homologous
  protein 1) (Lin & Barber 1996, Pang et al. 2004, Mishima et al. 2007), a feature
  of the reaction captured here as positive regulation of the hydrolysis reaction
  by SLC9A1:CHP1:Ca2+.
