stable_id: R-HSA-4420365
display_name: Defective B3GALT6 does not transfer Gal to the tetrasaccharide linker
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 6 (B3GALT6) normally transfers a second galactose
  to the tetrasaccharide linker, an initiator sequence  required for the biosynthesis
  of chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and heparans. Defects in B3GALT6 cause
  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome progeroid type 2 (EDSP2; MIM:615349), resulting in a broad
  range of skeletal and connective tissue disorders characterised by loose skin, spinal
  deformaty, muscle hypotonia, impaired wound healing and joint dislocation (Okajima
  et al. 1999, Nakajima et al. 2013, Malfait et al. 2013). Defects in B3GALT6 can
  also cause spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity type 1 (SEMDJL1; MIM:271640),
  characterised by spinal deformaty and lax joints, especially of the hands and respiratory
  compromise resulting in early death (Nakajima et al. 2013, Malfait et al. 2013).
  Mutations causing EDSP2 include S309T and R6W and the frameshift mutations R197Afs*81
  and D118Afs*160 (Nakajima et al. 2013, Malfait et al. 2013). Mutations causing SEMDJL1
  include M1?, R232C, D156N, C300S, S56G, P67L, D207H and G217S (Nakajima et al. 2013,
  Malfait et al. 2013).
