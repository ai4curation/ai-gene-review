summary: 'The catalytic activity of linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC)
  enables recruitment of TRAF-associated NF-κB activator (TANK) binding kinase 1 (TBK1)
  and inhibitor-kappa-B kinase (IKK) epsilon (IKKε or IKBKE) to the TNFR1 signaling
  complex, also known as complex-I (Lafont E et al. 2018; Xu D et al. 2018). LUBAC,
  composed of the HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN subunits, generates linear Met1-linked
  polyubiquitin chains. HOIP deficiency strongly diminished recruitment of TBK1 or
  IKBKE to the complex-I in human epithelial cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and lung
  carcinoma A549 cells (Lafont E et al. 2018). Western blot analysis revealed that
  TBK1 and IKBKE are recruited to and strongly phosphorylated within the TNFR1 complex
  in various TNFα-stimulated human cell lines including A549, keratinocyte HaCaT,
  monocytic U937 and THP-1 cells (Lafont E et al. 2018). Similarly, TBK1 was found
  to associate with components of the complex-I in the LUBAC-dependent manner in mouse
  cells (Xu D et al. 2018). IKBKE, but not TBK1, was detected within the TNFR1 complex
  in human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)-immortalized dermal fibroblasts
  derived from patients with TBK1 deficiency as a result of loss-of-function mutation
  at W619* (Taft J et al. 2021). The enzymatic activity of TBK1/IKBKE is initiated
  by phosphorylation at S172 located in the T loop of the TBK1 and IKKε kinase domains
  (Shimada T et al. 1999; Kishore N et al. 2002; Gu L et al. 2013). Activated TBK1
  and IKBKE are known to trigger phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3
  (IRF3) and IRF7 and subsequent expression of type I interferons (IFNs; IFN-α/β)
  downstream of pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors 3 and 4
  (TLR3, TLR4), cGAS/STING and RIG-I-like receptors (Fitzgerald KA et al. 2003; Fang
  R et al. 2017). While TBK1 or IKBKE showed limited effect on TNFα-induced gene expression
  in human A549 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (Lafont E et al. 2018), both
  kinases prevented TNFα-induced cell death by suppressing RIPK1 activation in human
  and mouse cells (Lafont E et al. 2018; Xu D et al. 2018; Taft J et al. 2021). TBK1
  and/or IKBKE directly phosphorylate RIPK1 within the TNFR1 signaling complex to
  prevent RIPK1 kinase-dependent cell death downstream of TNFR1 (Lafont E et al. 2018;
  Xu D et al. 2018). TBK1 or IKBKE deficiency enhanced TNF-induced autophosphorylation
  of RIPK1, association of RIPK3 with caspase-8:FADD and phosphorylation of MLKL in
  human A549 and HeLa cells (Lafont E et al. 2018). Similar findings were reported
  for mouse cells (Lafont E et al. 2018; Xu D et al. 2018). In vivo studies showed
  that the embryonic lethality of Tbk1−/− mice was caused by TNFα-stimulated hyperactivation
  of RIPK1 kinase activity (Xu D et al. 2018). Furthermore, chronic systemic autoinflammation
  in patients carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TBK1 (W619*, R440*
  and Y212D) is associated with the enhanced TNFα-induced RIPK1-dependent cell death
  (Taft J et al. 2021). In addition, TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of CYLD may also
  control the TNFR1 signaling pathway by regulating the ubiquitination status of RIPK1
  (Xu X et al. 2020; Taft J et al. 2021). These data suggest that TBK1 and IKBKE downregulate
