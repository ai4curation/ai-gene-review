stable_id: R-HSA-1112587
display_name: STAT1 and STAT3 dimers translocate to the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In untreated cells STAT1 and STAT3 are distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm
  and nucleus. A few minutes after Interleukin-6 treatment both are preferentially
  located in the nucleus. This translocation is transient; after 2 hours the distribution
  is comparable to that of untreated cells (Zhang et al. 1995). It is believed that
  STATs entry to the nucleus is mediated by importins via nuclear pore complexes (NPCs)
  (Reich & Liu 2006).
