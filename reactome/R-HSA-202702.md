stable_id: R-HSA-202702
display_name: CD177 binds PECAM-1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CD177 is a 58- to 64-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein
  expressed exclusively by neutrophils, neutrophilic metamyelocytes, and myelocytes,
  but not by any other blood cells. It has been shown that neutrophil-specific CD177
  is a heterophilic binding partner of PECAM-1, constituting a novel pathway that
  promotes neutrophil transmigration.
