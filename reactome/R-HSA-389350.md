stable_id: R-HSA-389350
display_name: Activation of Cdc42 by pVav1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Vav1 functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42, facilitating
  its activation. Once activated, Cdc42 transmits its signals downstream to the PAK1
  kinase, which plays a key role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell signaling.
  This Vav1-Cdc42-PAK1 signaling axis is crucial for processes like cell movement
  and immune responses (Tybulewicz 2005).
