display_name: Autophosphorylation of BTK/ITK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After initial phosphorylation by SFK's, subsequently Y223 (Y180 in ITK and
  Y206 in TEC) in the SH3 domain of BTK is autophosphorylated, which may prevent inhibitory
  intramolecular interactions (Nore et al. 2003, Joseph et al. 2007, Park et al. 1996)
