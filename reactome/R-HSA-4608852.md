stable_id: R-HSA-4608852
display_name: SMURF1/2 ubiquitinates PRICKLE1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PRICKLE1 is a conserved PCP protein with a localization pattern opposite
  to that of DVL.  PRICKLE1 is recruited to the PARD6A:ppDVL2:SMURF complex through
  its interaction with DVL and is subsequently ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase activity
  of SMURF (Narimatsu et al, 2009; Jenny et al, 2005).  This leads to localized degradation
  of PRICKLE1, contributing to its asymmetrical localization (Narimatsu et al, 2009).
  Note that in this reaction the interaction between PRICKLE1 and DVL is not shown.
