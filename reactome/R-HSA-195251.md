stable_id: R-HSA-195251
display_name: Assembly of the destruction complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The exact composition of the destruction complex is not known. A number of
  components appear to form a core complex, while others may associate with the complex
  transiently when a Wnt signal is present (reviewed in Kimelman and Xu, 2006). The
  core components  include Axin, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), Casein kinase
  1 (CKI) alpha, beta-catenin, Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and Adenomatous Polyposis
  Coli (APC). CK1 epsilon, Diversin and PP1 may also be components of the complex.
