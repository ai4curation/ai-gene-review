stable_id: R-HSA-9701549
display_name: AcK685-p-Y705,S727 STAT3 and SIN3A bind the PDRM1 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Acetylated, phosphorylated STAT3 and SIN3A bind to the PRDM1 promoter downstream
  of ALK signaling as assessed by ChIP in NPM-ALK cells (Gambi et al, 2019). Binding
  contributes to transcriptional repression of PRDM1, also known as BLIMP1, a transcription
  factor with roles in innate and adaptive immune response in B and T cells (reviewed
  in Boi et al, 2015).
