display_name: p-2S-SMAD3:p-2S-SMAD3:SMAD4 forms a complex with SP1 and EP300 at the
  COL1A2 gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The heterotrimer composed of SMAD4 and two molecules of phosphorylated SMAD3
  binds to the promoter of the collagen I gene COL1A2, together with the transcription
  factor SP1 (Zhang et al. 2000, Ihn et al. 2006) and the histone acetyltransferase
  EP300 (p300) (Higashii et al. 2003, Ihn et al. 2006). SMAD2 interferes with binding
  of SMAD3 to the COL1A2 promoter (Meng et al. 2010). The transcription factor YBX1,
  activated by interferon-gamma (IFNG) signaling can bind to SMAD3 at the COL1A2 promoter
  and interfere with the recruitment of EP300 (Higashi et al. 2003).
