stable_id: R-HSA-72691
display_name: Formation of the 43S pre-initiation complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ternary complex (Met-tRNAi:eIF2:GTP) binds to the complex formed by the
  40S subunit, eIF3 and eIF1A, to form the 43S complex. eIF1A promotes binding of
  the ternary complex to the 40S subunit within 43S. The initiator methionyl-tRNA
  from the ternary complex is positioned at the ribosomal P site.
