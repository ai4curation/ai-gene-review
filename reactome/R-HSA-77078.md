summary: After the capping complex is formed, the RNA triphosphatase activity of the

  to a diphosphate.<BR>The RNA triphosphatase (RTP) domain of mammalian capping enzyme
  is a member of a superfamily of phosphatases that include the protein tyrosine phosphatases,
  some lipid phosphatases, and several nucleic acid phosphatases. This family uses
  a conserved nucleophilic cysteine residue to attack the target phosphate. A transient
  phospho-cysteinyl enzyme intermediate is then hydrolyzed to regenerate the enzyme
  active site. It should be noted that while higher eukaryotic capping enzymes use
  PTP-like triphosphatase domains, the yeast triphosphatases are a completely different
  class of enzymes. The yeast RTPs are metal-dependent phosphatases. RNA 5'-triphosphatase
