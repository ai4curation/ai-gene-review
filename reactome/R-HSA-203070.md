display_name: Association of profilin with monomeric actin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Profilins PFN1 and PFN2 bind to monomeric actin (G-actin), forming a 1:1
  complex and subsequently regulate actin filament barbed end assembly downstream
  of various signaling pathways (Pring et al. 1992, Korenbaum et al. 1998, Nodelman
  et al. 1999)
