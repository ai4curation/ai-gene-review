stable_id: R-HSA-209566
display_name: TRAF6 is auto-ubiquitinated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The activity of TRAF6 is regulated by autoubiquitination. This process, in
  turn, is regulated by p62. Cells devoid of p62 exhibit low basal TRAF6 polyubiquitination.
  When p62 is expressed, auto-ubiquitination of TRAF6 is enhanced. The details curated
  in this event represent the ubiquitination of TRAF6, even as ubiquitin is shown
  as 1 stoichiometrically.
