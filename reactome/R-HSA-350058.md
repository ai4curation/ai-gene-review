summary: 'Mammalian CSL Corepressor Complexes: In the absence of activated Notch signaling,
  DNA-bound CSL proteins recruit a corepressor complex to maintain target genes in
  the repressed state until Notch is specifically activated. The mammalian corepressor
  complexes include NCOR complexes, but may also include additional corepressor proteins,
  such as SHARP (reviewed in Mumm, 2000 and Kovall, 2007). The exact composition of
  the CSL NCOR complex is not known, but in other pathways the "core" NCOR corepressor
  complex includes at least one NCOR protein (NCOR1, NCOR2, CIR), one Histone Deacetylase
  protein (HDAC1, HDAC3, or certain others), and one TBL1 protein (TBL1X, TBL1XR1)
  (reviewed in Rosenfeld, 2006). In some contexts, the core NCOR corepressor complex
  may also recruit additional corepressor proteins or complexes, such as the SIN3
  complex, which consists of SIN3 (SIN3A, SIN3B), and SAP30, or other SIN3-associated
  proteins. An additional CSL - NCOR binding corepressor, SHARP, may also contribute
  to the CSL corepressor complex in some contexts (Oswald, 2002). The CSL corepressor
  complex also includes a bifunctional cofactor, SKIP, that is present in both CSL
  corepressor complexes and CSL coactivator complexes, and may function in the binding
  of NICD and displacement of the corepressor complex during activated Notch signaling
  (Zhou, 2000). The formation of the CSL-NCOR corepressor complexes is modelled here
  as the simultaneous assembly of the various components shown. The order of addition
  of components is not known, and may vary in different contexts.'

## Summary

Mammalian CSL Corepressor Complexes: In the absence of activated Notch signaling, DNA-bound CSL proteins recruit a corepressor complex to maintain target genes in the repressed state until Notch is specifically activated. The mammalian corepressor complexes include NCOR complexes, but may also include additional corepressor proteins, such as SHARP (reviewed in Mumm, 2000 and Kovall, 2007). The exact composition of the CSL NCOR complex is not known, but in other pathways the "core" NCOR corepressor complex includes at least one NCOR protein (NCOR1, NCOR2, CIR), one Histone Deacetylase protein (HDAC1, HDAC3, or certain others), and one TBL1 protein (TBL1X, TBL1XR1) (reviewed in Rosenfeld, 2006). In some contexts, the core NCOR corepressor complex may also recruit additional corepressor proteins or complexes, such as the SIN3 complex, which consists of SIN3 (SIN3A, SIN3B), and SAP30, or other SIN3-associated proteins.
