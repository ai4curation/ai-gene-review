summary: Dynamin is a large GTPase whose GTP hydrolysis activity is required for the
  scission of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ferguson
  and De Camilli, 2012).  Dynamin is recruited to the plasma membrane through protein-protein
  interactions with many components of the clathrin-coated pit including ITSNs, SNX9
  and 18 and amphiphysin (Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003; Soulet et al, 2005; David et
  al, 1996; Owen et al, 1998; Shupliakov et al, 1997).  Although dynamin is recruited
  at lower levels throughout formation of the clathrin-coated pit, the bulk of dynamin
  is recruited at late stages, after the incorporation of BAR domain-containing proteins
  and actin-polymerizing factors (Ferguson et al, 2009; Taylor et al, 2011; Taylor
  et al, 2012; Posor et al, 2013; Meineke et al, 2013; Aguet et al, 2013; reviewed
  in Daumke et al, 2014).  Several BAR domain proteins have SH3 domains that bind
  the proline rich domain (PRD) of dynamin.  These interactions regulate dynamin GTPsae
  activity and vesicle formation (Neuman and Schmid, 2013).  To facilitate scission
  of a clathrin-coated pit from the plasma membrane, dynamin self assembles into helical
  oligomers, stimulating its GTPase activity and contributing to the membrane remodeling
  required to form the neck of the emerging vesicle (Sweitzer and Hinshaw 1998; Yoshida
  et al, 2004; Chappie et al, 2010; Faelber et al, 2011; Ford et al, 2011; reviewed
  in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Daumke et al, 2014).
