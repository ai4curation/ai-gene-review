stable_id: R-HSA-2972966
display_name: POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG bind the HHEX promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The HHEX gene is bound by POU5F1 (OCT4) (Boyer et al. 2005), SOX2 (Boyer
  et al. 2005), and NANOG (Boyer et al. 2005, Lister et al. 2009) and POU5F1 represses
  expression (Babaie et al. 2007, Kunarso et al. 2010). POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG bind
  adjacently (Boyer et al. 2005) therefore POU5F1 and SOX2 may heterodimerize. As
  inferred from mouse, HHEX is required for hepatic differentiation (Hunter et al.
  2007), hematopoiesis (Jayaraman et al. 2000), and endodermal tissues for forebrain
  and thyroid (Martinez Barbera et al. 2000).
