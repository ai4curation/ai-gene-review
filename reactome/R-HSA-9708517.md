stable_id: R-HSA-9708517
display_name: FBXL17 ubiquitinates BACH1 (in BACH1:FBXL17:SCF (SKP2))
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The leucine-rich repeat family of F-box proteins (FBXLs) function as adapter
  for the SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase. FBXL17 is a regulator
  of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2) oxidative stress pathway.
  By binding to the transcriptional repressor/regulator protein BACH1 it controls
  the transcription of the NFE2L2 target heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) via turnover of
  BACH1 in the absence or presence of extrinsic oxidative stress (Tan et al, 2013).
