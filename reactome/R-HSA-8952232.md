stable_id: R-HSA-8952232
display_name: BCL2L11 (BIM) gene transcription is stimulated by RUNX3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In response to TGF-beta treatment, transcription factors RUNX3 (presumably
  in complex with CBFB), SMAD3 (presumably in complex with SMAD4) and FOXO3 (FOXO3A)
  bind to their corresponding response elements in the promoter of the pro-apoptotic
  BCL2L11 (BIM) gene, synergistically stimulating BCL2L11 transcription (Wildey et
  al. 2003, Yano et al. 2006, Yamamura et al. 2006).
