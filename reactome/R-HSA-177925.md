species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'SHC1 (Src homology 2 domain-containing) transforming protein can bind to
  either phosphorylated tyrosine sites Y1172 (p-Y1172) i.e. Y1148 (p-Y1148) in the
  mature protein and/or tyrosine Y1197 (p-Y1197) i.e. Y1173 (p-Y1173) in the mature
  protein on the EGF receptor. The N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain (PBD)
  of SHC1, also known as the phosphotyrosine interaction (PI) domain, binds to phosphorylated
  p-Y1172 (i.e. p-Y1148) of EGFR, which is part of the NPXpY motif. The SH2 domain
  of SHC1 binds to p-Y1192 (i.e. p-Y1173) of EGFR (Batzer et al. 1995, Songyang et

The N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain (PBD) of SHC1, also known as the phosphotyrosine interaction (PI) domain, binds to phosphorylated p-Y1172 (i.e. p-Y1148) of EGFR, which is part of the NPXpY motif. The SH2 domain of SHC1 binds to p-Y1192 (i.e. p-Y1173) of EGFR (Batzer et al. 1995, Songyang et al. 1995, Sakaguchi et al. 1998).
