summary: 'The TCR is a multisubunit complex that consists of clonotypic alpha/beta
  chains noncovalently associated with the invariant CD3 delta/epsilon/gamma and TCR
  zeta chains. T cell activation by antigen presenting cells (APCs) results in the
  activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that associate with CD3 and TCR zeta
  subunits and the co-receptor CD4. Members of the Src kinases (Lck), Syk kinases
  (ZAP-70), Tec (Itk) and Csk families of nonreceptor PTKs play a crucial role in
  T cell activation. Activation of PTKs following TCR engagement results in the recruitment
  and tyrosine phosphorylation of enzymes such as phospholipase C gamma1 and Vav as
  well as critical adaptor proteins such as LAT, SLP-76 and Gads. These proximal activation
  leads to reorganization of the cytoskeleton as well as transcription activation
  of multiple genes leading to T lymphocyte proliferation, differentiation and/or
  effector function. '
