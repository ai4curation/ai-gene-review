display_name: Tenascins C, R, (X, N) bind lecticans
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Tenascins are a family of 4 oligomeric extracellular glycoproteins, tenascin
  (TN) C, R, X, and N (also called W). In rotary shadowing images TNC is seen as a
  symmetrical structure called a hexabrachion (Erickson & Iglesias 1984). This hexamer
  is formed from initial trimers (Kammerer et al. 1988). All members of the family
  are believed able to form trimers but only C, R and W have the extra cysteine required
  for form hexamers. All have amino-terminal heptad repeats, epidermal growth factor
  (EGF)-like repeats, fibronectin type III domain repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal
  fibrinogen-like globular domain (Hsia & Schwartzbauer 2005). TNC was the first family
  member to be discovered and is the best characterised. Its subunits vary greatly
  in size (between 190 and 330 kDa of the tenascin-C monomer) due to glycosylation
  and splicing isoforms (Joester & Faissner 1999). During embryonic development TNC
  is expressed in neural, skeletal, and vascular tissues. In adults it is detectable
  only in tendon and tissues undergoing remodeling processes such as wound repair
  and neovascularization, or in pathological processes such as inflammation and tumorigenesis
  (Midwood & Orend 2009). TNR forms dimers and trimers (Norenberg et al. 1992) and
  is expressed only in the developing and adult central nervous system. TNC and TNR-null
  mice (single and double knock-outs) have surprisingly normal gross phenotypes, but
  exhibit behavioural and wound healing abnormalities (Mackie & Tucker 1999, Montag-Sallaz
  & Montag 2003). TNX is the largest member of the family and is widely expressed
  during development, but in adults is limited to musculoskeletal, cardiac, and dermal
  tissue. It can form trimers, though it lacks the amino-terminal cysteine residues
  involved in hexamer formation. It is clearly associated with a variant of a heritable
  connective tissue disorder known as Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, which is associated with
  fibrillar collagen defects (Burch et al. 1997, Mao et al. 2002). TNY is thought
  to be an avian orthologue of TNX (Chiquet-Ehrismann 2004). TNN, first identified
  in zebrafish (Weber et al. 1998), is the least well characterized member of the
  tenascin family. It forms hexamers (Degen et al. 2007) and is expressed in developing
  skeletal tissue and neural crest cells, a pattern that partially overlaps with TNC.
  <br><br>TNC and TNR bind to members of the lectican family, a class of extracellular
  chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans consisting of aggrecan, versican, brevican and

  and neurocan (Milev et al. 1994, Grumet et al. 1994, Rauch et al. 1997). TNR binds
