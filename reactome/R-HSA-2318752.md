stable_id: R-HSA-2318752
display_name: miR-26A microRNAs bind PTEN mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MIR26A microRNAs, miR-26A1 and miR-26A2, transcribed from genes on chromosome
  3 and 12, respectively, bind PTEN mRNA (Huse et al. 2009).<br><br>The MIR26A2 locus
  is frequently amplified in glioma tumors that retain one wild-type PTEN allele.
  The resulting miR-26A2 overexpression leads to down-regulation of PTEN protein level.
  Overexpression of miR-26A2 was shown to enhance tumorigenesis and negatively correlates
  with the loss of heterozygosity at the PTEN locus in a mouse PTEN +/- glioma model,
  based on monoallelic PTEN loss (Huse et al. 2009, Kim et al. 2010).
