summary: 'SDA-CoA (6,9,12,15-18:4(n-3)) is rapidly elongated by two carbon atoms to

  enzyme long-chain fatty acyl elongase (ELOVL5) mediates this reaction which and
  adds malonyl-CoA to the SDA-CoA and releases carbon dioxide and free CoA (Leonard

## Summary

SDA-CoA (6,9,12,15-18:4(n-3)) is rapidly elongated by two carbon atoms to 8,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoyl-CoA (8,11,14,17-20:4(n-3), ETA-CoA). The  NADPH-consuming enzyme long-chain fatty acyl elongase (ELOVL5) mediates this reaction which and adds malonyl-CoA to the SDA-CoA and releases carbon dioxide and free CoA (Leonard et al. 2004).
