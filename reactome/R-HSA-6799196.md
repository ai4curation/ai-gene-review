summary: In the last step, the MCIA complex and it is assumed all of the assembly
  factors (NDUFAF2-7, TIMMDC1) dissociate from the 980kDa complex to leave mature
  Complex I (Mckenzie & Ryan 2010, Andrews et al. 2013).

## Summary

In the last step, the MCIA complex and it is assumed all of the assembly factors (NDUFAF2-7, TIMMDC1) dissociate from the 980kDa complex to leave mature Complex I (Mckenzie & Ryan 2010, Andrews et al. 2013).
