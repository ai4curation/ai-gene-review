display_name: AP1G2 binds HGS and CHMP2A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AP-1 complex subunit gamma-like 2 (AP1G2) is an 87-kDa protein that is similar
  to gamma-adaptin (AP1G1), a large chain of the AP1 clathrin-associated adaptor complex,
  both in primary structure (60% amino acid identity) and domain organisation (Takatsu
  et al. 1998). AP1G2 can be viewed as a putative endosomal sorting and trafficking
  adaptor that is specifically required for degradative endocytic trafficking and
  may help in maintaining homeostasis of the multivesicular body (MVB) protein-sorting
  pathway. AP1G2 specifically interacts with the core ESCRT subunits hepatocyte growth
  factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS, aka HRS) and charged multivesicular
  body protein 2a (CHMP2A aka hVps2-1), involved in MVB processing (Doring et al.
  2010).<br><br>AP1G2 is also able to bind the large envelope protein (surface protein
  S) of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), a protein that plays an important role in viral
  budding (Hartmann-Stuhler & Prange 2001). Disruption of this binding can inhibit
  virus production (Rost et al. 2006). Thus, AP1G2 may play a role in L-mediated processes
  of viral biogenesis or pathogenesis.
