display_name: NGEF exchanges GTP for GDP on RHOA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The tyrosine phosphorylation of ephexin1 (NGEF)/Ephexin-1 enhances its exchange
  activity and specifically activates inactive RHOA:GDP to active RHOA:GTP. Activated
  RHOA regulates myosin II activity in neurons through Rho-associated kinase (ROCK),
  and leads to rapid growth cone collapse, neurite retraction, or neurite growth inhibition
  in axons. Through this repulsive mechanism EPH receptors and ephrins (EFNs) guide
  retinal axons to their targets in the visual centres in the brain (Sahin et al.
  2005).

## Summary

The tyrosine phosphorylation of ephexin1 (NGEF)/Ephexin-1 enhances its exchange activity and specifically activates inactive RHOA:GDP to active RHOA:GTP. Activated RHOA regulates myosin II activity in neurons through Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), and leads to rapid growth cone collapse, neurite retraction, or neurite growth inhibition in axons. Through this repulsive mechanism EPH receptors and ephrins (EFNs) guide retinal axons to their targets in the visual centres in the brain (Sahin et al. 2005).
