species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukins (IL) are immunomodulatory proteins that elicit a wide array
  of responses in cells and tissues. Interleukin 37 (IL-37, IL-1 F7) is a member of
  the IL-1 family. There are five isoforms of IL-37 (a-e) of which transcript IL-37b
  is known to be functional (Sharma et al. 2008). This isoform is represented in UniProt
  as the canonical form of IL-37 and in Reactome as the full length, unprocessed form
  of IL-37. IL-37 can bind the Interleukin-18 receptor 1 (IL-18R1) (Shi et al. 2003,
  Kumar et al. 2002). Upon binding to IL-18R1, IL-37 facilitates the recruitment of
  Single Ig IL 1 related receptor (SIGIRR, TIR-8, IL-1R8) forming a complex (Nold
  Petry et al. 2015). These events ultimately lead to suppression of cytokine production
  in several types of immune cells resulting in reduced inflammation.
