stable_id: R-HSA-9621406
display_name: EGR2 and SREBF2 dimer bind CYP51A1 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CYP51A1 encodes lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase, a protein involved in steroid
  biosynthetic pathways (Stromstedt et al, 1996; Strushkevich et al, 2010). Consistent
  with its expression during Schwann cell myelination, expression is synergistically
  activated by EGR2 and SREBF2 acting through cognate sites in the promoter (Nagarajan
  et al, 2001; Halder et al, 2002; LeBlanc et al, 2005; Jang et al, 2010).
