stable_id: R-HSA-9925159
display_name: CD274 mRNA binds miR-140 RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: microRNA-140 (miR-140) plays a key role in T cell differentiation to regulate
  immune homeostasis and in disease like osteoarthritis, cancer (Ghafouri-Fard et
  al., 2020, Guan et al., 2016). miR-140 also regulates PD-L1 expression. miR-140
  directly targets PDL1 mRNA and suppresses PDL1 expression. Luciferase assays with
  a PD-L1 3' UTR reporter in A549 and H1299 cells (Xie et al., 2018) and MG63 and
  SaOS2 (Ji et al., 2018), were used to show that PD-L1 is a direct target of miR-34a.
  The reduction of PD-L1 expression led to enhanced T-cell activation and anti-tumor
  immunity.
