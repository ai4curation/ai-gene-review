  PRMT1 and GATA1 and inhibited by the complex of RUNX1, SIN3A and PRMT6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The RUNX1:CBFB complex binds the promoter of the MIR27A gene, encoding microRNA
  miR-27a, and stimulates MIR27A transcription. Based on the analogy with the ITGA2B
  gene transcription, transcription of MIR27A is significantly upregulated by PRMT1-dependent
  arginine methylation of RUNX1, which interferes with the recruitment of the SIN3A
  (or, possibly, SIN3B) co-repressor (Zhao et al. 2008). The transcription activator
  complex at the MIR27A gene promoter includes the RUNX1:CBFB complex, PRMT1, the
  GATA1:ZFPM1 complex, histone acetyltransferases p300 (EP300) and PCAF (KAT2B), and
  the WDR5-containing histone methyltransferase MLL complex. The MLL complex produces
  the activating H3K4me3 mark on nucleosomes associated with the MIR27A gene promoter
  (Herglotz et al. 2013).<br>The transcription repressor complex at the MIR27A promoter
  is formed when SIN3A (or possibly SIN3B) co-repressor binds to the RUNX1:CBFB complex
  along with histone arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 and histone deacetylase HDAC1.
  Histone H3 arginine methylation by PRMT6 interferes with methylation of H3K4me2
