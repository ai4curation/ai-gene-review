stable_id: R-HSA-392748
display_name: L1 binds to AP-2 Clathrin complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: L1 in the C-domain membrane is internalized via clathrin mediated endocytosis.
  The assembly of clathrin coats at the plasma membrane depends on the adaptor complex
  AP-2 which is composed of two large chains (alpha and beta1  or beta2 adaptin),
  one medium (mu2) chain, and one small chain (sigma2). When dephosphorylated, the
  sorting signal/endocytic motif YRSLE sequence enables L1 to directly bind the mu2
  subunit of AP-2, and concentrates L1 molecules in clathrin coated areas of the plasma
  membrane.
