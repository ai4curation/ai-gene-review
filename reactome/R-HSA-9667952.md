stable_id: R-HSA-9667952
display_name: ANKLE2 is deacetylated by SIRT2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ANKLE2 (LEM4) is required for normal nuclear envelope (NE) formation at the
  end of mitosis (Ascencio et al. 2012, Kaufmann et al. 2016). Deacetylation of ANKLE2
  on residue K302 by SIRT2 promotes this process (Kaufman et al. 2016).
