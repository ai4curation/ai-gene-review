display_name: Formation of the lid particle 2 (LP2)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Two subcomplexes of the proteasome 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) lid,
  Module1 and lid particle 3 (LP3), associate to form the lid particle 2 (LP2) (reviewed
  in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). Existence of the lid subcomplex corresponding to
  LP2 was confirmed in human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, where it was shown
  that PSMD11 (Rpn6) of the LP3 subcomplex plays a crucial role in connecting Module
  1 and LP3 into LP2, through directly interacting with the Module 1 subunit PSMD6
  (Rpn7) (Bai et al. 2019).
