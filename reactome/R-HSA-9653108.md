display_name: Raf dimer inhibitors bind RAF heterodimers
species: Homo sapiens
summary: LY3009120, TAK-580 and TAK-632 are pan-RAF inhibitors that binds to all 3
  RAF isoforms as well as to RAF dimers to inhibit phosphorylation of MAP2K and MAPK
  proteins (Nakamura et al, 2013; Okaniwa et al, 2013; Sun et al, 2017; Peng et al,
  2015; Henry et al, 2015; Vakana et al, 2017). Because they inhibit the kinase activity
  of RAF homo- and heterodimers, treatment with pan-RAF dimer inhibitors generates
  minimal paradoxical RAF activation and inhibits cellular proliferation in a number
  of tumor models (Peng et al, 2015; Henry et al, 2015, Vakana et al, 2017; reviewed
  in Karoulia et al, 2017; Agianian and Gavathiotis, 2018; ).
