species: Homo sapiens
summary: After the nascent pre-mRNA undergoes the initial capping and methylation
  reactions, it gets associated with numerous factors, including the various heterogeneous
  nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPS), the nuclear Cap-Binding Complex, and many splicing
  factors that make the pre-mRNA a substrate for splicing, 3'-end processing, and
  in some cases editing.
