display_name: DSE converts GlcA to IdoA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The glucuronate (GlcA) moiety of chondroitin sulfate (CS) can undergo C-5
  epimerization to change into an iduronic acid (IdoA) moiety, thus changing the polymer
  composition and creating dermatan sulfate (DS). The GlcA of unsulfated chondroitin
  chains can also undergo this C-5 epimerization to produce dermatan. Dermatan-sulfate
  epimerase (DSE) mediates these reactions (Tiedemann et al. 2001). Mutations in DSE
  can cause a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDSMC2, MIM:615539; Mueller et al.,
  2013). More recently, a single homologue of DSE, dermatan sulfate epimerase-like
  (DSEL), has been determined to possess epimerase activity (Pacheco et al. 2009).
  DSEL is genetically associated with type II bipolar disorder (Goossens et al. 2003).
