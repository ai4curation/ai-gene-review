## Summary

Receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIPK1) polyubiquitination is required for the recruitment of the downstream signaling complexes such as the IkB kinase (IKK) complex in the response to TNFR1 stimulation (Ea CK et al. 2006; Blackwell K et al. 2013). RIPK1 is polyubiquitinated at Lys377 (K377, equivalent to K376 of mouse RIPK1)  (Ea CK et al. 2006). A point mutation of RIPK1 at Lys377 (K377R) was found to abolish its polyubiquitination and prevent the recruitment and activation of IKK and the TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex (Ea CK et al. 2006). TNFα-induced recruitment of the IKK complex to TNFR1 is completely impaired, recruitment of TAK1 is severely reduced, and recruitment of the LUBAC E3 ligase complex, is also reduced in human RIPK1-deficient Jukart T-cells (Blackwell K et al. 2013).
