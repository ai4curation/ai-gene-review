species: Homo sapiens
summary: The activated TGF-beta receptor complex is internalized by clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis into early endosomes. ZFYVE9 (SARA) resides in the membrane of early
  endosomes. Crystallographic studies suggest that dimeric SARA in the early endosome
  coordinates two R-SMAD molecules (SMAD2 and/or SMAD3) per one receptor complex.

## Summary

Crystallographic studies suggest that dimeric SARA in the early endosome coordinates two R-SMAD molecules (SMAD2 and/or SMAD3) per one receptor complex.
