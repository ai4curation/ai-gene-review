display_name: CUL9:RBX1 ubiquitinates BIRC5
species: Homo sapiens
summary: One defined target of CUL9 ubiquitin ligase is BIRC5 (also known as Survivin),
  which has roles in cellular proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis and maintenance
  of genome stability (Zhao et al, 2000; Watanabe, 2010). Deletion of CUL9 leads to
  polyploidy, abnormal nuclear morphology and DNA damage and is accompanied by an
  increase in survivin protein levels (Li et al, 2014). CUL9-mediated ubiquitination
  of BIRC5 is negatively regulated by the 3M complex, consisting of CUL7, CCDC8 and
  OBSL1 (Li et al, 2014; Yan et al, 2014). This CUL7-dependent inhibition of CUL9
  ubiquitin ligase activity is promoted by heterodimerization between CUL7 and CUL9
  (Li et al, 2014).
