stable_id: R-HSA-158313
display_name: factor XII -> factor XIIa
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cleavage of a single peptide bond converts factor XII to activated factor
  XII (factor XIIa) (Fujikawa and McMullen 1983; McMullen and Fujikawa 1985). Identification
  of the catalytic activity or activities responsible for this cleavage has not been
  straightforward. Studies in vitro have demonstrated the autoactivation of factor
  XII as well as activation by kallikrein. Both reactions require the presence of
  negatively charged surfaces and are accelerated in the presence of kininogen (high
  molecular weight kininogen, HK) (Griffin and Cochrane 1976; Meier et al. 1977; Silverberg
  et al. 1980). Recent work suggests that factor XII activation in vivo may occur
  primarily on endothelial cell surfaces and that, as in vitro, association with kininogen
  may accelerate the reaction (Mahdi et al. 2002; Schmaier 2004), although alternative
  pathways and alternative mechanisms for associating factor XII with the cell surface
  have not been excluded (Joseph et al. 2001).
