display_name: TPX2 binds AURKA at centrosomes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TPX2 binds to aurora kinase A (AURKA) at centrosomes. The first 43 amino
  acids at the N-terminus of TPX2 are needed for binding to AURKA (Bayliss et al.
  2003). HMMR (RHAMM) binds to TPX2 (Groen et al. 2004, Maxwell et al. 2005) and is
  involved in the proper localization of TPX2 to centrosomes and TPX2-mediated AURKA
  activation (Chen et al. 2014, Scrofani et al. 2015).<p>TPX2 binding to Aurora A
  protects premature AURKA degradation by APC/C-mediated proteolysis during early
  mitosis. TPX2 differentially regulates AURKA stability, activity and localization.
  While amino acids 1-43 in TPX2 facilitate complex formation between AURKA and TPX2
  and promote kinase activation, they are insufficient for AURKA targeting to the
  mitotic spindle (Giubettini et al. 2011).
