display_name: Recruitment of TRAF6 to CBM complex by binding to MALT1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRAF6 is a ubiquitin ligase that plays a central role in the IKK-dependent
  canonical NF-kB pathway. It is recruited to the CBM complex by binding to MALT1.
  The MALT1 C-terminal Ig domain and extension contain two binding motifs for TRAF6
  (Noels et al 2007). After oligomerzation TRAF6, together with Ubc13/Uev1A, activates
  TAK1 and IKK. It also acts as an E3 ligase for MALT1 and mediates lysine 63-linked
  ubiquitination (Oeckinghaus et al. 2007).
