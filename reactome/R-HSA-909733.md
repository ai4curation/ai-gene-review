display_name: Interferon alpha/beta signaling
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Type I interferons (IFNs) are composed of various genes including IFN alpha
  (IFNA), beta (IFNB), omega, epsilon, and kappa. In humans the IFNA genes are composed
  of more than 13 subfamily genes, whereas there is only one IFNB gene. The large
  family of IFNA/B proteins all bind to a single receptor which is composed of two
  distinct chains: IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The IFNA/B stimulation of the IFNA receptor
  complex leads to the formation of two transcriptional activator complexes: IFNA-activated-factor
  (AAF), which is a homodimer of STAT1 and IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which
  comprises STAT1, STAT2 and a member of the IRF family, IRF9/P48. AAF mediates activation
  of the IRF-1 gene by binding to GAS (IFNG-activated site), whereas ISGF3 activates
  several IFN-inducible genes including IRF3 and IRF7.'
