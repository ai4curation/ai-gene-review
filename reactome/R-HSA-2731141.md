stable_id: R-HSA-2731141
display_name: Syndecan-1 binds fibronectin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Syndecans have attached heparan sulfate (HS) and to a lesser extent chondroitin
  sulfate (CS) chains. These allow interactions with a large number of proteins. Various
  enzymes involved in post-translational HS chain modifications produce unique binding
  motifs that selectively recognize different proteins (Tkachenko et al. 2005). Syndecans
  binds with extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin (Human syndecan-1,
  Saunders & Bernfield 1988; rat syndecan-4 in Woods et al. 2000; rat syndecan-2 to
  bovine fibronectin in Klass & Woods 2000). Syndecan-1 functions to regulate integrin
  activity and fibronectin fibril assembly (Stepp et al. 2010).

Syndecan-1 functions to regulate integrin activity and fibronectin fibril assembly (Stepp et al. 2010).
