summary: One of the functions of PTEN is to act as a phosphoinositide phosphatase
  that catalyzes dephosphorylation of PIP3 into PIP2. PTEN thus reduces the amount
  of available PIP3, counteracting PI3K activity and downregulating AKT signaling.
  PTEN is frequently targeted by loss of function mutations in cancer and in familial
  cancer syndromes known as PTHS (PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes, a collection of
  diseases including Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, and Lhermitte-Duclos
  disease). Some PTEN loss-of-function variants are also found in autism spectrum
  disorder patients. For a recent review of PTEN involvement in cancer, please refer
  to Hollander et al. 2011. <br> <br>The majority of missense mutations that impair
  phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of PTEN cluster in exon 5 of PTEN gene and
  result in substitution of amino acid residues in the catalytic cleft of the phosphatase
  domain. Arginine at position 130 is the most frequently substituted PTEN residue
  in cancer. R130 of human PTEN is the last arginine residue in the conserved H-C-K/R-A-G-K-G-R
  sequence (corresponding to HCXXGXXR motif of protein tyrosine phosphatases) in the
  catalytic cleft of the PTEN phosphatase domain and is essential for catalysis (Barford
  et al. 1994, Lee et al. 1999). PTEN R130 substitution mutants show markedly decreased
  phosphoinositide phosphatase activity (Han et al. 2000, Koul et al. 2002) and are
  frequently found in endometrial carcinoma (Kong et al. 1997, Konopka et al. 2007).
  The cysteine residue at position 124 (C124) of human PTEN, in the conserved H-C-K/R-A-G-K-G-R
  sequence, 'attacks' the phosphate group of a substrate and forms a thio-phosphate
  intermediate during the dephosphorylation reaction (Guan and Dixon 1991, Barford
  et al. 1994, Lee et al. 1999). Therefore, substitution of this critical C124 abolishes
  PTEN phosphatase activity (Han et al. 2000, Koul et al. 2002). Substitution of histidine
  H123 in the conserved H-C-K/R-A-G-K-G-R sequence also impairs PTEN phosphatase activity
  (Lee et al. 1999).<br><br>Missense mutations also target amino acid residues in
  the N-terminal phosphatase domain that are outside the catalytic cleft. Substitution
  of histidine at position 93 affects the conserved WPD loop of the phosphatase domain
  of PTEN, and PTEN H93 mutants show low phosphoinositide phosphatase activity (Lee
  et al. 1999). Serine residue S170 and histidine residue H173 participate in the
  formation of hydrogen bonds between the N-terminal phosphatase domain of PTEN and
  the C-terminal membrane-binding C2 domain (Lee et al. 1999). H173, and to a lesser
  extent S170, are targeted by missense mutations in cancer, and substitution mutants
  have impaired phosphoinositide phosphatase activity (Han et al. 2000). <br><br>Missense
  mutations also occur in the C2 domain of PTEN. The C2 domain is implicated in membrane
  binding and localization of PTEN, but also in PTEN roles unrelated to its phosphoinositide
  phosphatase function (Raftopoulou et al. 2004). Since the roles of these C2 domain
  PTEN mutants in cancer have not been clarified, these variants will be annotated
  when more information becomes available. <br><br>Besides missense mutations, nonsense
  mutations that result in PTEN protein truncation are also frequently found in cancer
  samples. The three residues most frequently targeted by nonsense mutations are R130,
  R233 and R335. While R130* mutation directly affects the phosphatase domain of PTEN,
  R233* and R335* affect the C2 domain. PTEN 130*, PTEN R233* and PTEN R335* mutants
  have not been functionally studied, but it was shown that comparable PTEN truncation
  mutants generated by directed mutagenesis, PTEN-254 and PTEN-342, were unstable
  when expressed in human cells and had severely diminished phosphatase activity in
  vitro (Georgescu et al. 1999). <br>Cancer-derived PTEN truncation mutants whose
  phosphatase domain (amino acid residues 14-185) is absent or partially truncated
  are annotated as truncation mutant set members (PTEN E7*, PTEN R11*, PTEN K13*,
  PTEN Q17*, PTEN E18*, PTEN G20*, PTEN L23*, PTEN Y27*, PTEN E40*, PTEN E43*, PTEN

  PTEN truncation mutants whose phosphatase domain is intact but whose C2 tensin-type
  domain (amino acids 190-350), responsible for interaction with membrane phospholipids

  truncated are annotated as truncation mutant set candidates (PTEN R189*, PTEN G209*,
  PTEN C211*, PTEN Q214*, PTEN C218*, PTEN Q219*, PTEN K221*, PTEN Y225*, PTEN S229*,
