display_name: Cleavage of ERBB4m80 by gamma-scretase complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After ERBB4 is cleaved by ADAM17, gamma-secretase complex performs additional
  cleavage in the transmembrane region of the m80 ERBB4 fragment, releasing the soluble
  ERBB4 intracellular domain of 80 kDa, known as s80 or E4ICD (Ni et al. 2001).
