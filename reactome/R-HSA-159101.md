stable_id: R-HSA-159101
display_name: NXF1:NXT1 (TAP:p15) binds capped mRNA:CBC:EJC:TREX (minus DDX39B)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The mRNA is transferred from ALYREF of the TREX complex to NXF1 (TAP) of
  the NXF1:NXT1 export complex (Hautbergue et al. 2008). Interaction between the TREX
  complex and NXF1 exposes the arginine-rich RNA-binding domain of NXF1 (Viphakone
  et al. 2012). Methylation of arginine residues on ALYREF also appears to be necessary
  for dissociation of mRNA from ALYREF during the transfer (Hung et al. 2010). The
  interaction between ALYREF and NXF1 occurs in the vicinity of nuclear speckles (Teng
  and Wilson 2013). DDX39B (UAP56) binds (Kota et al. 2008) and hydrolyzes ATP (Taniguchi
  and Ohno 2008). UAP56 is believed to hydrolyze ATP and UAP56:ADP is believed to
  dissociate at some point during the transfer of the mRNA to NXF1 (Taniguchi and
  Ohno 2008, Chang et al. 2013).
