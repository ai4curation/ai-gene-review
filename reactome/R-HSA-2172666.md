display_name: RB1 binds condensin II
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'RB1 binds the condensin II complex through interaction with the NCAPD3 subunit
  of condensin II. This interaction is E2F independent and is important for targeting
  of the condensin II complex to chromatin (Longworth et al. 2008). RB1 may be particularly
  important for targeting of the condensin II complex to centromeres (Manning et al.
  2010). RB1 deficient cells exhibit chromosome condensation defects and are prone
  to aneuploidy caused by aberrant chromosomal segregation. Therefore, tumor suppressor
  role of RB1 is based both on E2F-dependent control of G1/S transition, as well as
  on E2F-independent maintenance of genomic stability through regulation of mitotic
  chromosome condensation (Longworth et al. 20008, Coschi et al. 2010, Manning et
  al. 2010).<br><br>The role of RB1 in the maintenance of genomic stability is supported
  by studies of the childhood eye cancer retinoblastoma and its precursor, retinoma.
  Retinoma, a quiescent precursor of malignant retinoblastoma with functional loss
  of both RB1 alleles, is genomically unstable (Dimaras et al. 2008). Also, while
  the majority of retinoblastoma tumors are caused by the loss-of-function of the
  tumor suppressor gene RB1, ~2% of retinoblastoma tumors in unilaterally affected
  patients are initiated by a high level amplification of MYCN gene, in the presence
  of two functional, unmutated RB1 alleles. These tumors, with normal RB1 and amplified
  MYCN show a much lower level of genomic instability than retinoblastoma tumors with
  RB1 loss-of-function (Rushlow et al. 2013). '
