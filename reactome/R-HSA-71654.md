display_name: PGAM dimers isomerise 3PG to 2PG
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cytosolic phosphoglycerate mutase catalyzes the reversible isomerisation
  of 3- and 2-phosphoglycerate. The active form of the enzyme is a dimer. There are
  two isoforms of this enzyme, PGAM1 (isoform B, widely expressed in non-muscle tissue)
  and PGAM2 (isoform M, expressed in muscle) (Blouquit et al. 1988; Omenn and Cheung
  1974; Repiso et al. 2005; Tsujino et al. 1993).
