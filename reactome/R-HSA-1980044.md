display_name: NOTCH1 binds JAG2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NOTCH1 is activated by JAG2 ligand expressed on a neighboring cell. When
  the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 expressing exogenous human NOTCH1 is grown with
  NIH3T3 cells expressing exogenous human JAG2, myogenic differentiation is inhibited
  and a NOTCH1 polypeptide that corresponds to the NOTCH intracellular domain appears
  (Luo et al. 1997).

## Summary

NOTCH1 is activated by JAG2 ligand expressed on a neighboring cell. When the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 expressing exogenous human NOTCH1 is grown with NIH3T3 cells expressing exogenous human JAG2, myogenic differentiation is inhibited and a NOTCH1 polypeptide that corresponds to the NOTCH intracellular domain appears (Luo et al. 1997).
