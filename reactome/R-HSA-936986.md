species: Homo sapiens
summary: Polyubiquitinated TRAF6 (as E3 ubiquitin ligase) generates free K63 -linked
  polyubiquitin chains that non-covalently associate with ubiquitin receptors of TAB2/TAB3
  regulatory proteins of the TAK1 complex, leading to the activation of the TAK1 kinase.

## Summary

Polyubiquitinated TRAF6 (as E3 ubiquitin ligase) generates free K63 -linked polyubiquitin chains that non-covalently associate with ubiquitin receptors of TAB2/TAB3 regulatory proteins of the TAK1 complex, leading to the activation of the TAK1 kinase.
