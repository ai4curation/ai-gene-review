display_name: Association of Cks1 with SCF(Skp2) complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The accessory protein, Cks1 promotes efficient interaction between phosphorylated
  p27 and the SCF (Skp2) complex (Ganoth et al., 2001; Spruck et al., 2001). Cks1
  binds to Skp2 in the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and C-terminal tail (Hao et
  al., 2005). The phosphorylated Thr187 side chain of p27 associates with a phosphate
  binding site on Cks1, and the side chain containing Glu185 is positioned in the
  interface between Skp2 and Cks1 where it interacts with both (Hao et al., 2005).
