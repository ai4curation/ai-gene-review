stable_id: R-HSA-164505
display_name: Synthesis of full-length duplex viral DNA with a discontinuous plus
  strand
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After the second jump, elongation of the plus and minus strands continues.
  The elongation process requires strand displacement, which RT can mediate, at least
  in vitro (Huber et al. 1989; Hottiger et al. 1994; Rausch and Le Grice 2004). The
  final product is a blunt-ended linear duplex DNA with a discontinuity in its "plus"
  strand at the site of the cPPT sequence motif.

## Summary

After the second jump, elongation of the plus and minus strands continues. The elongation process requires strand displacement, which RT can mediate, at least in vitro (Huber et al. 1989; Hottiger et al. 1994; Rausch and Le Grice 2004). The final product is a blunt-ended linear duplex DNA with a discontinuity in its "plus" strand at the site of the cPPT sequence motif.
