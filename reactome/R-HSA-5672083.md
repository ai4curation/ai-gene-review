stable_id: R-HSA-5672083
display_name: KTN1 binds Kinesin-1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The C-terminal region of KTN1 (kinectin) binds the cargo-binding tail of
  the kinesin heavy chain KIF5A and enhances microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity
  of KIF5A. KIF5A is a part of the conventional kinesin complex, kinesin-1. RHO GTPases,
  KTN1 and kinesin-1 colocalize on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and ER-derived
  vesicles and are thought to be involved in organelle/vesicle motility (Ong et al.
  2000, Vignal et al. 2001)
