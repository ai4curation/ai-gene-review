stable_id: R-HSA-5683986
display_name: APBB1 and MAPK8 bind diphosphorylated H2AFX
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the absence of sufficient EYA1-4 activity, APBB1 (FE65) binds diphosphorylated
  H2AFX and recruits MAPK8 (JNK1) to H2AFX. This triggers pro-apoptotic signaling
  and targets the affected cell for apoptosis instead of DNA repair (Cook et al. 2009).

## Summary

In the absence of sufficient EYA1-4 activity, APBB1 (FE65) binds diphosphorylated H2AFX and recruits MAPK8 (JNK1) to H2AFX. This triggers pro-apoptotic signaling and targets the affected cell for apoptosis instead of DNA repair (Cook et al. 2009).
