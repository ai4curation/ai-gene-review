stable_id: R-HSA-6785648
display_name: MEMO1 binds RHOA:GTP:DIAPH1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MEMO1, in complex with phosphorylated ERBB2 heterodimers, associates with
  the complex of activated RHOA and formin family member DIAPH1. MEMO1 maintains the
  plasma membrane association of the RHOA:GTP:DIAPH1 complex (Zaoui et al. 2008) and
  modulates RHOA:GTP:DIAPH1-regulated actin and microtubule dynamics and the consequent
  cell motility/migration downstream of ERBB2 (Marone et al. 2004, Zaoui et al. 2010).
