summary: The cytokine receptor gp130 is the shared signalling subunit of the interleukin
  (IL)-6-type cytokines. IL-6 and IL-11 signal through gp130 homodimer whereas leukaemia
  inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR), Cardiotrophin-like
  cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1), Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) and Oncostatin-M (OSM) exerts
  its action through a heterodimer of gp130 and the LIF receptor (LIFR) (Heinrich
  et al. 2003, Giese et al. 2005). LIFR beta structure closely resembles that of gp130
  and upon ligand binding forms gp130:LIFR beta heterodimer. Finally CNTFR alpha complexed
  with this signal transducing heterodimer converts into functional tripartite CNTF
  receptor and induces phosphorylation of both gp130 and LIFR beta (Davis et al. 1993,
  Stahl & Yancopoulos 1994). Formation of the tripartite complex then leads to activation
  of Janus family kinases, JAK1, 2, 3, and TYK2 and phosphorylation of tyrosine residues
  on the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 (Kass 2011).
