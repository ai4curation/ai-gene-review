summary: 'Activation of the Hh pathway causes the GLI:SUFU complex to concentrate
  in the primary cilium (Humke et al, 2010; Tukachinsky et al, 2010; Kim et al, 2009).  The
  net movement of the GLI:SUFU complex into the cilium occurs downstream of SMO phosphorylation
  and activation, and requires the Cos2 homologue KIF7, but how the signal is transmitted
  from the SMO:EVC complex is not clear (Chen et al, 2009; Chen et al, 2010; Pusapati
  et al, 2013; Endoh-Yamagami et al, 2009; Liem et al, 2009; Cheung et al, 2009).
  SUFU appears to be a major regulator of the ratio of full length:repressor forms
  of GLI proteins in vertebrate cells, and the GLI:SUFU interaction is required for
  the production of GLIR.  Dissociation of the GLI:SUFU complex after ligand stimulation
  diverts GLI from the degradation pathway and allows the full-length form to be activated
  (Humke et al, 2010; Tukachinsky et al, 2010; Pan et al, 2006; Kim et al, 209; Wen
  et al, 2010; Chen et al, 2009; reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013). This represents

  In Drosophila, absence of SUFU has no effect on Hh signaling, and the scaffolding

## Summary

Activation of the Hh pathway causes the GLI:SUFU complex to concentrate in the primary cilium (Humke et al, 2010; Tukachinsky et al, 2010; Kim et al, 2009).  The net movement of the GLI:SUFU complex into the cilium occurs downstream of SMO phosphorylation and activation, and requires the Cos2 homologue KIF7, but how the signal is transmitted from the SMO:EVC complex is not clear (Chen et al, 2009; Chen et al, 2010; Pusapati et al, 2013; Endoh-Yamagami et al, 2009; Liem et al, 2009; Cheung et al, 2009). SUFU appears to be a major regulator of the ratio of full length:repressor forms of GLI proteins in vertebrate cells, and the GLI:SUFU interaction is required for the production of GLIR.  Dissociation of the GLI:SUFU complex after ligand stimulation diverts GLI from the degradation pathway and allows the full-length form to be activated (Humke et al, 2010; Tukachinsky et al, 2010; Pan et al, 2006; Kim et al, 209; Wen et al, 2010; Chen et al, 2009; reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013).
