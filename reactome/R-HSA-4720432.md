display_name: HDAC4 SUMOylates NR1H2 (LXRbeta) with SUMO2,3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HDAC4 SUMOylates NR1H2 (LXR-beta) with SUMO2,3 at lysine-409 and lysine-447
  (lysine-410 and lysine-448 of the isoform used by Ghisletti et al. 2007) (Venteclef
  et al. 2010). SUMOylation is enhanced when NR1H2 binds specific oxysterols and causes
  NR1H2 to recruit the NCOR repressor and transrepress promoters such as iNOS.
