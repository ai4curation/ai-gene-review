## Summary

Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), associated with the plasma membrane of the host cell, mediates the hydrolytic cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein component of the viral membrane-associate S3:M:E:encapsidated SARS coronavirus genomic RNA: 7a:O-glycosyl 3a tetramer complex associated with ACE2 (Xia et al, 2020; Bestle et al, 2020; Koch et al, 2021).<br><br>Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a receptor expressed in a broad range of cells from human organ systems including respiratory, urinary, digestive, reproductive, and immune systems.
