stable_id: R-HSA-5682896
display_name: LC3:ATG7 dimer binds ATG3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ATG7 dimer with bound LC3 binds ATG3. Deletion mutagenesis, biochemical
  data and modeling suggest that recruitment of ATG3 to the ATG7 N-terminal FAP domain
  results in presentation of the ATG3 active site to the LC3-ATG7 thioester linkage
  from the opposing monomer in the ATG7 dimer (Tanida et al. 2012, Klionsky & Schulman
  2014). The activated LC3 protein is transferred to the E2-like enzyme ATG3 through
  a thioester bond (Ichimura et al. 2000).
