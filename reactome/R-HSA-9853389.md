stable_id: R-HSA-9853389
display_name: FIGNL1 binds RAD51
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FIGNL1 strongly binds to RAD51 and localizes to ionizing radiation-induced
  DNA damage foci. The interaction involves the N-terminal half of FIGNL1, requiring
  conserved residues 295-344 called FIGNL1's RAD51 binding domain (FRBD). The efficiency
  of homologous recombination repair (HRR) is impaired in cells with FIGNL1 depletion
  (Yuan and Chen 2013). The interaction between FIGNL1 and RAD51 is conserved between
  human and Arabidopsis. The FIGNL1 binding partner FIRRM (also known as Apolo1 or
  FLIP or C1orf112) does not directly interact with RAD51 but depletion of either
  FIRRM or FIGNL1 negatively regulates the formation or the turnover of RAD51 foci
  in Arabidopsis (Fernandes et al. 2018).
