stable_id: R-HSA-202216
display_name: Phosphorylation of SLP-76
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once SLP-76 is recruited to Gads its rapidly phosphorylated on the tyrosine
  residues in the N-terminal acidic domain. This domain contains three tyrosine phosphorylation
  sites, Y113, Y128 and Y145. These tyrosine residues are phosphorylated by tyrosine
  kinase ZAP-70 and these phosphorylated tyrosine residues provide the binding site
  for the SH2 domains of the incoming signaling proteins like Vav, Itk and PLC-gamma1.
