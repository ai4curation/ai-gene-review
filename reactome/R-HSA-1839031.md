summary: '8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (EMS) is a myeloproliferative disorder
  that rapidly progresses to acute myeloid leukemia if not treated (reviewed in Jackson,
  2010, Knights and Cook, 2010).  A characteristic feature of EMS is the presence
  of fusion proteins that contain the kinase domain of FGFR1 and the oligomerization
  domain of an unrelated protein.  This is believed to promote the ligand independent
  dimerization and activation of the kinase domain. To date, there are 11 identified
  partners that form fusion proteins with FGFR1 in EMS: ZMYM2 (Xiao, 1998; Popovici,
  1998; Reiter, 1998; Ollendorff, 1999; Xiao, 2000), FGFR1OP1 (Popovici, 1999), CNTRL
  (Guasch, 2000), BCR (Demiroglu, 2001), FGFR1OP2 (Grand, 2004), TRIM24 (Belloni,
  2005), CUX1 (Wasag, 2011), MYO18A (Walz, 2005), CPSF6 (Hidalgo-Curtis, 2008), HERV-K
  (Guasch, 2003) and LRRFIP1 (Soler, 2009).'

## Summary

8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (EMS) is a myeloproliferative disorder that rapidly progresses to acute myeloid leukemia if not treated (reviewed in Jackson, 2010, Knights and Cook, 2010).  A characteristic feature of EMS is the presence of fusion proteins that contain the kinase domain of FGFR1 and the oligomerization domain of an unrelated protein.  This is believed to promote the ligand independent dimerization and activation of the kinase domain.
