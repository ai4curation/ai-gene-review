stable_id: R-HSA-5218815
display_name: p-6Y-VEGFR2 binds NCK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In response to VEGF, the increased actin polymerization required to trigger
  actin based motility involves the recruitment of adapter protein NCK to VEGFR2 (Lamalice
  et al. 2007). Phosphorylated tyrosine 1214 in VEGFR2 is the binding site for NCK.
  NCK later recruits FYN and PAK2, which are required for the activation of SAPK2/p38
  activation, formation of stress fibers, and endothelial cell migration (Lamalice
  et al. 2006, Stoletov et al. 2004, Lu et al. 1997). NCK also participates in a signaling
  pathway leading to actin nucleation and polymerization through its interactions
  with N WASP and WAVE1 (Stoletov et al. 2004, Rhoatgi et al. 2001).
