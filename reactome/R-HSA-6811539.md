species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The inital scaffold of the cornified envelope (CE) is reinforced by the
  inclusion of loricrin (LOR) and small proline-rich proteins (SPRs), which together
  comprise about 75% of the total mass of the CE. Other proteins include filaggrin
  (FLG) (8%), elafin (6%), cystatin A (5%), involucrin (IVL) and keratin intermediate
  filaments (KIFs) (about 2% each) (Steinert & Marekov 1995). Other minor proteins
  include repetin (RPTN), trichohyalin (TCHH) and elafin (PI3) (Steinert & Marekov
  1997, Steinert et al. 1998). <br><br>LOR is poorly soluble in vivo, while SPRs are
  very soluble. Both are preferred substrates of cytosolic transglutaminase-3 (TGM3)
  (Candi et al. 1999, Steinert et al. 1999, Tarcsa et al. 1999), which suggests that
  TGM3 may cross-link LOR and SPRs to create soluble complexes that are more easily

  are good substrates for TGM1 (Candi et al. 1999, Steinert et al. 1999) which may
  link the LOR-SPR complexes to the CE scaffold. LOR can also be crosslinked by TGM5
  (Candi et al. 2001). SPR content varies in epithelia from different body sites and
  increasing SPR content correlates with mechanical requirements of the tissue (Steinert
  et al. 1998). In humans LOR is initially deposited in the granular layer of the
  epidermis in keratohyalin granules, intermixed with profilaggrin (Yoneda & Steinert
  1993). These are encoded in a linked ''Epidermal Differentiation Complex.'' (Kypriotou

  al. 2005). LOR can also form crosslinks with keratin and filaggrin (Steinert & Marekov
  1995). CE crosslinking involves TGM1, TGM3 and TGM5 (Lorand & Graham 2003). The
  type-II keratin chains (K1, K2e and K5) are crosslinked at a specific Lys residue
  that is located in a conserved region of the V1 subdomain of the head domain (Steinert

  Gln495 and Gln496 (Simon & Green 1998). In vitro, LOR is a substrate for TGM1-3
  and 5 (Candi et al. 1995). In the epidermis, TGM1, TGM5 and TGM3 are believed to
  crosslink LOR sequentially; an initial attachment by TGM1 and 5 forms interchain
  crosslinks followed by a compaction process that involves TGM3 (Candi et al. 2005).

## Summary
