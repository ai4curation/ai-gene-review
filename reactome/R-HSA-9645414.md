display_name: Auto ubiquitination of TRAF6 bound to ALPK1:ADP-heptose:TIFA oligomer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6) possesses ubiquitin ligase activity
  and undergoes K-63-linked auto-ubiquitination after its oligomerization. In the
  first step, ubiquitin is activated by an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme. The activated
  ubiquitin is transferred to a E2 conjugating enzyme (a heterodimer of proteins Ubc13
  and Uev1A) forming the E2-Ub thioester. Finally, in the presence of ubiquitin-protein
  ligase E3 (TRAF6, a RING-domain E3), ubiquitin is attached to the target protein
  (TRAF6 on residue Lysine 124) through an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus
  of ubiquitin and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue in the target protein.
  In contrast to K-48-linked ubiquitination that leads to the proteosomal degradation
  of the target protein, K-63-linked polyubiquitin chains act as a scaffold to assemble
  protein kinase complexes and mediate their activation through proteosome-independent
  mechanisms. This K63 polyubiquitinated TRAF6 activates the TAK1 kinase complex.

## Summary

TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6) possesses ubiquitin ligase activity and undergoes K-63-linked auto-ubiquitination after its oligomerization. In the first step, ubiquitin is activated by an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme. The activated ubiquitin is transferred to a E2 conjugating enzyme (a heterodimer of proteins Ubc13 and Uev1A) forming the E2-Ub thioester. Finally, in the presence of ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 (TRAF6, a RING-domain E3), ubiquitin is attached to the target protein (TRAF6 on residue Lysine 124) through an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue in the target protein. In contrast to K-48-linked ubiquitination that leads to the proteosomal degradation of the target protein, K-63-linked polyubiquitin chains act as a scaffold to assemble protein kinase complexes and mediate their activation through proteosome-independent mechanisms. This K63 polyubiquitinated TRAF6 activates the TAK1 kinase complex.
