display_name: ILF3 binds CDH11 gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ILF3 (Interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3) binds to two out of four putative
  ILF3 binding sites in the CDH11 gene promoter, at positions -2982 to -2978, and
  -2602 to -2598 upstream from the start site. ILF3 binding directly stimulates CDH11
  gene transcription (Zhang et al. 2011).
