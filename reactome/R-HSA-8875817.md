display_name: MET phosphorylates STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated MET phosphorylates STAT3 at Y705, triggering STAT3 dimerization
  and nuclear translocation (Boccaccio et al. 1998, Zhang et al. 2002, Cramer et al.
  2005). Endocytosis of MET and interaction with STAT3 at endosomes may be required
  for sustained STAT3 phosphorylation in response to HGF stimulation (Kermorgant and
  Parker 2008). Activated SRC may also contribute to phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705.
  STAT3 may promote HGF transcription in a SRC-dependent way, but this autocrine HGF
  loop may be limited to breast cancer cells (Wojcik et al. 2006, Sam et al. 2007).
