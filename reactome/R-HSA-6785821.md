stable_id: R-HSA-6785821
display_name: SOCS5,(SOCS1) bind IL4RA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SOCS5 can bind the type I IL4R, reducing its association with JAK1, which
  results in the inhibition of IL4-mediated STAT6 activation (Seki et al. 2002). Similarly
  SOCS1 serves as a regulator of IL-4 signaling, diminishing the magnitude and duration
  of STAT6 activation (Dickensheets et al. 2007).
