stable_id: R-HSA-5218811
display_name: DOCK180:ELMO binds CRK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The SH3 domain of CRK interacts constitutively with proline rich motifs present
  in Dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK180), an exchange factor for RAC1. Unlike many
  GEFs, DOCK180 does not contain a conserved Dbl homology (DH) domain. Instead, it
  has a DHR2 or DOCKER domain capable of loading RAC1 with GTP (Brugnera et al 2002).
  Binding of DOCK180 to RAC1 alone is insufficient for GTP loading, a DOCK180-ELMO
  interaction is required. Engulfment and cell motility protein 1 (ELMO1) or ELMO2
  form a complex with DOCK180 which functions as a bipartite GEF to optimally activate
  RAC1 (Gumienny et al 2001, Brugnera et al 2002, Birge et al. 2009).
