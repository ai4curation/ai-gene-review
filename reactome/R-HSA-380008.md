stable_id: R-HSA-380008
display_name: lysine + tRNA(Lys) + ATP => Lys-tRNA(Lys) + AMP + pyrophosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: KARS (cytosolic lysyl tRNA synthetase) catalyzes the reaction of lysine,
  tRNA(Lys), and ATP to form Lys-tRNA(Lys), AMP, and pyrophosphate. The enzyme, a
  class II tRNA synthetase, is a homodimer found in the cell as a component of the
  mutienzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex. The same gene encodes both cytosolic
  and mitochondrial KARS enzymes (Shiba et al. 1997).
