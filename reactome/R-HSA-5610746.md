stable_id: R-HSA-5610746
display_name: SCF(beta-TrCP) ubiquitinates p-GLI3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Hyperphosphorylated GLI3 binds directly with beta-TrCP though at least three
  independent domains and is polyubiquitinated at lysines 773, 778, 784 and 800 (Tempe
  et al, 2006). After ubiquitination, GLI3 is processed to the truncated repressor
  form by the proteasome (Tempe et al, 2006; Wang and Li, 2006)
