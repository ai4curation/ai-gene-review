stable_id: R-HSA-5665982
display_name: RHOA:GTP:DIAPH1 binds EVL and sequesters profilin:G-actin from MKL1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once activated by binding to RHOA:GTP, DIAPH1 binds profilin:G-actin complexes
  together with EVL (VASP) homotetramers and promotes elongation of actin filaments
  (Copeland and Treisman 2002, Grosse et al. 2003, Kursula et al. 2008, Breitsprecher
  et al. 2008). Binding of nonpolymerized actin (G-actin) to DIAPH1 and EVL releases
  MKL1 (MAL) transcription co-factor which is inhibited when bound to G-actin (Miralles
  et al. 2003).

## Summary

Once activated by binding to RHOA:GTP, DIAPH1 binds profilin:G-actin complexes together with EVL (VASP) homotetramers and promotes elongation of actin filaments (Copeland and Treisman 2002, Grosse et al. 2003, Kursula et al. 2008, Breitsprecher et al. 2008). Binding of nonpolymerized actin (G-actin) to DIAPH1 and EVL releases MKL1 (MAL) transcription co-factor which is inhibited when bound to G-actin (Miralles et al. 2003).
