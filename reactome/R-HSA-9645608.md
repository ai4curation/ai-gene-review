display_name: v-ATPase:Ragulator:RRAGA,B:GTP:RRAGC,D:GDP binds mTORC1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The heterodimer comprising RRAGA,B:GTP and RRAGC,D:GDP (RagA:GTP or RagB:GTP
  complexed with RagC:GDP or RagD:GDP) forms the active conformation of the Rag complex
  that recruits the mTORC1 complex from the cytosol to the lysosomal membrane (Kim
  et al. 2008, Sancak et al. 2008, Sancak et al. 2010) where RHEB activates the protein
  kinase activity of mTORC1. Hydrolysis of ATP by the v-ATPase complex is also required
  for recruitment of mTORC1 (Zoncu et al. 2011). The active state of the RRAGA,B:RRAGC,D
  heterodimer is less stably associated with the Ragulator complex and appears to
  cycle with mTORC1 between the lysosomal membrane and the cytosol (Lawrence et al.
  2018). The cycling may provide a mechanism for attenuating mTORC1 signaling.
