display_name: Exocytosis of ficolin-rich granule membrane proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Ficoli-1 rich granules are a relatively new fourth neutrophil granule population
  that is enriched in the microbial lectin ficolin-1. Ficolin-1 is present in tertiary
  granules, but ficolin-1 rich granules can be differentiated by having low levels
  of gelatinases and an elevated exocytosis propensity (Rorvig et al. 2009, 2013).
  The importance of these granules may be to provide rapid release of pattern recognition
  molecules to activate the lectin complement pathway (Rorvig et al. 2009).
