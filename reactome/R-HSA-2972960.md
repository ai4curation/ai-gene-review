display_name: POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG bind the FGF2 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The FGF2 gene is bound by POU5F1 (OCT4) (Boyer et al. 2005), SOX2 (Boyer
  et al. 2005, Lister et al. 2009), NANOG (Boyer et al. 2005, Lister et al. 2009)
  and expression of the FGF2 mRNA is activated by POU5F1 (Babaie et al. 2007, Greber
  et al. 2007) and SOX2 (Greber et al. 2007).
