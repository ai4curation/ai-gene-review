stable_id: R-HSA-8950328
display_name: Expression of Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Experiments using human cord blood CD4(+) T cells show 22 protein spots and
  20 protein spots, upregulated and downregulated proteins respectively, following
  Interleukin-12 stimulation (Rosengren et.al, 2005). Among the up-regulated proteins
  is :Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A(PPIA). This protein is found in four spots,
  which probably represent four different isoforms.
