stable_id: R-HSA-389532
display_name: PP2A binds CTLA4 dimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Newly synthesized CTLA4 expressed on the transmembrane associates with PP2A,
  and under these conditions the inhibitory function of CTLA4 is inactive. CTLA4 homodimer
  has a PP2A trimer bound to each tail. The A subunit of PP2A binds the lysine-rich
  motif located at lysine residues 152, 155, and 156 of the juxtamembrane region of
  the CTLA-4 tail, and the C subunit binds the Y165 residue (Wendy A Teft et al. 2009).
