stable_id: R-HSA-186800
display_name: PI3K catalyses the phosphorylation of PIP2 to PIP3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The preferred substrate of PI3K is phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  [PI(4,5)P2] (PIP2), which is phosphorylated to the trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] (PIP3).
  PI3-kinase and its products have been found to be of importance in PDGF-stimulated
  actin reorganization, and directed cell movement, as well as in the stimulation
  of cell growth and inhibition of apoptosis.
