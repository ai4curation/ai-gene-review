display_name: IRAK4 binds to the activated TLR receptor:TIRAP:MyD88 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IRAK4 is the mammalian homolog of Drosophila melanogaster Tube [Towb P et
  al 2009; Moncrieffe MC et al 2008]. Like Tube, IRAK4 possesses a conserved N-terminal
  death domain (DD), which mediates interactions with MyD88 at one binding site and
  a downstream IRAK kinase at the other, thereby bridging MyD88 and IRAK1/2 association
  [Towb P et al 2009; Lin SC e al 2010]. IRAK-4 plays a critical role in Toll receptor
  signaling - any interference with IRAK-4's kinase activity virtually abolishes downstream
  events. This is not the case with other members of the IRAK family [Suzuki N et
  al 2002; Li S et al 2002].
