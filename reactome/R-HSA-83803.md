display_name: Recruitment of RNA Polymerase III to TFIIIB:SNAPc:Type 3 Promoter Complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The binding of SNAPc to the PSE is stabilized not only by cooperative interactions
  with the Oct-1 POU domain, but also by cooperative interactions with TBP and Brf2
  (Hinkley et al., 2003 ; Ma and Hernandez, 2002; Mittal and Hernandez, 1997).  Moreover,
  Brf2, which cannot bind to DNA on its own, recognizes and stabilizes TBP bound to
  the TATA box (Cabart and Murphy, 2001; Cabart and Murphy, 2002; Ma and Hernandez,
  2002).  Thus, the U6 transcription initiation complex is stabilized by a complex
  network of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.  Nothing is known, however,
  about how the complex recruits RNA polymerase III.
