stable_id: R-HSA-265177
display_name: Exocyst complex formation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A beta cell contains about 10 000 secretory granules. Of these, about 1000
  are docked at the inner surface of the plasma membrane and a subset of about 100
  docked granules form the "readily releasable" pool (granules which are released
  within about 5 minutes of glucose stimulation). As inferred from rat MIN6 cells,
  docking occurs by interaction between EXOC3/Sec6 located on the membrane of the
  secretory granule and EXOC4/Sec8 located at the plasma membrane (Tsuboi et al. 2005).
  Additional components (EXOC1, EXOC2, EXOC5, EXOC6, EXOC7, EXOC8) form the Exocyst
  Complex. EXOC7 binds the plasma membrane (Matern et al. 2001).
