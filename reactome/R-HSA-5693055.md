summary: Expression of TNFAIP3 (also known as A20) is upregulated by NFkappaB activation.
  TNFAIP3 (A20) is believed to inhibit NFkappaB with the help of its ubiquitin-editing
  functions (Wertz IE et al, 2004). The N-terminal half of TNFAIP3 harbors a deubiquitinating
  (DUB) domain that mediates the deubiquitination of K63-polyubiquitinated substrates
  such as receptor interacting protein 1 (RIPK1), an essential mediator of the proximal
  TNFR1 signalling complex  (Shembade N et al. 2010; Wertz IE et al. 2004). The carboxy-terminal
  domain of TNFAIP3 (A20), composed of seven C2/C2 zinc fingers, functions as a ubiquitin
  ligase by polyubiquitinating target proteins with K48-linked ubiquitin chains, thereby
  targeting them for proteasomal degradation (Wertz IE et al. 2004). TNFAIP3 zinc
  fingers have been also shown to support TNFAIP3's binding to different ubiquitinated
  molecules (Wertz IE et al. 2004; Shembade N et al. 2010; Lu TT et al. 2013).<p>The
  Reactome pathway shows that upon TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) stimulation, the E3 ubiquitin
  ligases such as baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein (BIRC2/3 or cIAP1/2) mediate
  polyubiquitination of RIPK1 generating K63-linked chains. TNFAIP3 removes these
  K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, preventing the interaction of RIPK1 with NFkappaB
  essential modulator (NEMO) (Wertz IE et al. 2004). Subsequently, TNFAIP3 facilitates
  addition of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains to RIPK1, targeting it for proteasomal
  degradation (Wertz IE et al. 2004). In this way, TNFAIP3 restricts TNF-induced NFkappaB
  signaling by sequential deubiquitination and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of RIPK1.<p>TNFAIP3
  (A20) is thought to limit NFkappaB activation, however the inhibitory mechanisms
  for TNFAIP3 are not fully understood and are partially contradicting. A study with
  knockin mice expressing DUB-inactive Tnfaip3 C103A mutant reported that the deubiquitinase
  (DUB) activity was dispensable for LPS- or TNF-stimulated NFkappaB signaling (De
  A et al 2014). In contrast to Tnfaip3 knockout mice that develop perinatal lethality,
  the knockin Tnfaip3 C103A mice were normal and did not have an inflammatory phenotype
  (De A et al 2014). These finding are in agreement with an earlier study reporting
  that the Tnfaip3 C103A knockin mice were grossly normal for at least 4 months and
  contained a normal number of lymphocytes (Lu TT et al. 2013). In addition, bone
  marrow-derived macrophage cells (BMDM) from the knockin mice showed normal LPS-
  and TNF-induced NFkappaB activation and downstream gene expression, comparable to
  cells from wild-type mice (De A et al 2014). The study suggests that the deubiquitinase
  activity of TNFAIP3 in general is not obligate for most of the regulatory functions
  of TNFAIP3 and alternative mechanisms might be involved in TNFAIP3-mediated NFkappaB
  regulation (De A et al 2014). Indeed, there is biochemical evidence for different
  mechanisms that may contribute to TNFAIP3 inhibitory effects on TNFR1 pro-inflammatory
  signaling in a cell type-dependent manner:<ul><li>Deubiquitination of K63-linked
  ubiquitin chains from RIPK1 by the OTU domain and adding of K48-linked polyubiquitin
  chains via its forth zinc finger (ZnF4) domain (Wertz IE et al. 2004).</li><li>Triggering
  degradation of E2 enzymes such as ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Ubc13 by adding K48-linked
  polyubiquitin chains and disruption of interactions between E2 and E3 (BIRC2,3 or
  TRAF2) enzymes in the TNFR1 pathway. This event was impaired with DUB-inactive TNFAIP3
  (C103A, within the OTU domain) suggesting that there might be a crosstalk with DUB-dependent
  mechanisms (Shembade N et al. 2010).</li><li>A non-catalytic blockage of TAK1-mediated
