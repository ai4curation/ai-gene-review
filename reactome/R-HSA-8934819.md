display_name: Cytoplasmic proteases cleave Profilaggrin producing Filaggrin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Filaggrin is initially synthesized as a large, insoluble, highly phosphorylated
  precursor containing many tandem copies of 324 residues. This precursor is dephosphorylated
  and proteolytically cleaved by several proteases, including the undefined protease
  PEP1 (Resing et al. 1996), mu-calpain (Yamazaki et al. 1997), furin, PCSK6 (PACE4)
  (Pearton et al. 2001), PRSS8 (cap1) (Leyvraz et al. 2005), ST14 (matriptase) (List
  et al. 2003), CELA2 (Bonnart et al. 2010), CASP14 (Denecker et al. 2007) and Kallikrein-related
  peptidase 5 (KLK5) (Sakabe et al. 2013). Filaggrin is further processed and proteolytically
  degraded by CASP14 (Eckhart & Tschachler 2011).
