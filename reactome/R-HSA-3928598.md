display_name: Recruitment of p190RhoGEF to p-FAK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FAK-mediated spine morphogenesis was shown to occur, in part through Rho
  guanine nucleotide exchange factor 28 (ARHGEF28, p190RhoGEF), suggesting that FAK-mediated
  spine maturation might proceed through a FAK-RhoGEF-RHOA mechanism. p190RhoGEF binds
  directly to phosphorylated PTK2 through a motif in the RhoGEF C-terminal domain,
  a feature not shared with other GEFs (Moeller et al. 2006, Rico et al. 2004, Zhai
  et al. 2003).
