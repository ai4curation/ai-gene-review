display_name: Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) produces Nitric Oxide (NO)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) produces NO from L-arginine. There are three
  isoforms of NOS, endothelial, neuronal and inducible (eNOS, nNOS, and iNOS) (Alderton
  WK et al. 2001). The three isozymes are regulated differentially. eNOS and nNOS,
  which are constitutively expressed in certain cells, are activated by he binding
  of calcium (Ca2+) and calmodulin (Alderton WK et al. 2001; Feng C 2012). iNOS is
  induced in response to immunostimulatory signals and once synthesized, iNos is constitutively
  active (Alderton WK et al. 2001; Aktan F 2004; Pautz A et al. 2010). NO produced
  by NOS acts as a signalling molecule by diffusing across cell membranes to activate
  soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC).

## Summary

The three isozymes are regulated differentially. eNOS and nNOS, which are constitutively expressed in certain cells, are activated by he binding of calcium (Ca2+) and calmodulin (Alderton WK et al. 2001; Feng C 2012). iNOS is induced in response to immunostimulatory signals and once synthesized, iNos is constitutively active (Alderton WK et al. 2001; Aktan F 2004; Pautz A et al. 2010).
