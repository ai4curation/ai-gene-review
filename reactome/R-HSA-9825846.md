stable_id: R-HSA-9825846
display_name: MITF-M-dependent PMEL gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PMEL is a protein component of the melanosome that forms fibrils on which
  melanin is synthesized and accumulates (reviewed in Bissig et al, 2016). Another
  melanosome-specific protein MLANA plays a role in the maturation and stabilization
  of PMEL (Hoashi et al, 2005; Ho et al, 2016; reviewed in Bissig et al, 2016). Both
  PMEL and MLANA are direct transcriptional targets of MITF-M as assessed by ChIP,
  EMSA and reporter gene and Northern analysis (Du et al, 2003; Baxter and Pavan,
  2003; Strub et al, 2011; reviewed in Cheli et al, 2010; Goding and Arnheiter, 2019).
