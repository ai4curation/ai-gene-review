display_name: Translocation Of Telomerase RNP And Alignment Of RNA Template (TERC)
  To Extended Single Stranded Telomeric Chromosome-End
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The human telomerase RNP can catalyze multiple rounds of repeat addition
  on the same telomeric substrate in vitro. Before initiating synthesis of another
  repeat, telomerase undergoes a translocation step to reposition itself on the telomere.
  Base pairs in the DNA/RNA hybrid are unannealed, the RNA template is repositioned
  relative to the active site, and the template base-pairs at the 3' end of the newly
  synthesized DNA. The anchor site interaction with DNA 5' of the RNA-DNA duplex is
  thought to maintain the interaction of telomerase with DNA during the translocation
  step.
