display_name: Ubiquitination of IKBKG by TRAF6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: During the phosphorylation of the IKK beta (IKBKB), the regulatory subunit
  NEMO (IKBKG) undergoes K-63-linked polyubiquitination. Ubiquitinated TRAF6 acts
  as a E3 ligase and induces this ubiquitination. Studies of different NF-kappa-B
  signaling pathways revealed several potential ubiquitination sites on IKBKG (e.g.,
  K285, K277, K309 and K399) (Fuminori et al. 2009).
