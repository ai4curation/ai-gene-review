display_name: EGFR binds EPS15, EPN1, EPS15L1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: EH-containing proteins such as EPS15, EPN1 and EPS15L1 are required for the
  endocytosis of ligand-activated EGFR (Confalonieri et al, 2000; Huang et al, 2004;
  reviewed in van Bergen en Henegouwen, 2009).  EPS15 and EPN1 bind components of
  the clathrin coated pit through DPF motifs and likely bind to EGFR through the ubiquitin
  interacting motifs (UIMs).  In this way EH proteins may help cluster activated EGFR
  into nascent clathrin-coated pits (Kazazic et al, 2009; Benmerah et al, 2000; reviewed
  in van Bergen en Henegouwen, 2009).  Note, however, that EH-containing proteins
  are also involved in the clathrin-independent endocytosis of EGFR (Sigismund et
  al, 2005)
