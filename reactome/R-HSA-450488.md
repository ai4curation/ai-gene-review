stable_id: R-HSA-450488
display_name: BRF1 Complex recruits RNA degradation activities
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BRF1 recruits RNA degradation activities to hydrolyze the RNA bound to BRF1.
  Coimmunoprecipitation has shown BRF1 interacts with the exosome (3' to 5' nuclease),
  XRN1 (5' to 3' nuclease), and DCP1a and DCP2 (decapping). BRF1 localizes RNAs to
  processing bodies, sites of translation repression and possible sites of RNA degradation.
