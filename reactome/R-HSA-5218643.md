stable_id: R-HSA-5218643
display_name: HSP90AA1 binds p-6Y-VEGFR2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Heat-shock protein of 90 kDa (HSP90) a molecular chaperone, associates with
  VEGFR2 in response to VEGF. The last 130 amino acids of VEGFR2 C-terminal portion
  are involved in the association of VEGFR2 with HSP90. HSP90 associated with VEGFR2
  is involved in regulating the activity of a Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK)
  that is required to phosphorylate FAK on residue S732 (Le Bouef et al. 2004, 2006).
