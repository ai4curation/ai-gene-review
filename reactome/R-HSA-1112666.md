display_name: BLNK (SLP-65) Signalosome hydrolyzes phosphatidyinositol bisphosphate
  forming diacylglycerol and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phospholipase C gamma (PLC-gamma) is activated by phosphorylation in response
  to antigen-binding by the B cell receptor (Carter et al. 1991, Roitman and Wang
  1992, Rodriguez et al. 2001, Kim et al. 2004, Sekiya et al. 2004). Phospholipase
  C gamma hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to yield inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
  and diacylglycerol (Carter et al. 1991, Kim et al. 2004). Human B cells contain
  both PLC-gamma1 and PLC-gamma2, with PLC-gamma2 predominating (Coggeshall et al.
  1992).
