display_name: Formation of translation initiation complexes yielding circularized
  Ceruloplasmin mRNA in a  'closed-loop' conformation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The precise order of events leading to the circularization of poly (A) mRNA
  during translation initiation is unknown. Here the association of PABP with the
  poly (A) mRNA and the association of PABP with eIF4F are represented as occuring
  simultaneously after formation of the initiation complex.  However, it is also possible
  that these interactions occur during the formation of the translation initiation
  complex. The binding of eIF4F to the cap and binding of PABP to the poly (A) tail,  for
  example,  may occur at the same time. In fact, the eIF4G-PABP interaction helps
  eIF4F to bind tighter to the cap (Borman et al. 2000.)  In addition, eIF4B and eIF4H
  bind more transiently to the mRNA and may not be part of an initial complex in which
  PABP has not yet touched eIF4G.
