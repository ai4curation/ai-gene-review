display_name: CSN polymer binds CaPO4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In milk, caseins (CSNs) interact with calcium phosphate (CaPO4), forming
  large stable colloidal particles called micelles. These micelles make it possible
  to maintain a supersaturated CaPO4 concentration in milk, providing the newborn
  with sufficient calcium phosphate for the mineralisation of calcified tissues. Human
  alpha-S1-casein (CSN1S1) is able to bind CaPO4 in milk. CSN1S1 forms a disulfide
  cross-linked heteropolymer with kappa-casein (CSN3), another CSN that is thought
  to stabilise micelle formation and thus preventing casein precipitation in milk
  (Brignon et al. 1985, Rasmussen et al. 1995, Johnson et al. 1995).
