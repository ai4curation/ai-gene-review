display_name: Active MTORC1 binds the ULK1 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Under nutrient-rich conditions, the mTORC1 complex associates with the ULK
  complex (Mizushima 2010). Binding is mediated by Raptor, a substrate recognition
  subunit of mTORC1, and the PS domain of ULK1 (Hosokawa et al. 2009).<br><br>Active
  mTORC1 phosphorylates ULK1 Ser-758, which disrupts the interaction between ULK1
  and AMPK, thereby maintaining ULK1 in an inactive state (Jung et al. 2009, Kim et
  al. 2011, Egan et al. 2011). <br><br>When cellular energy is depleted, AMPK is activated.
  It inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity via phosphorylation of both TSC2 and raptor (Gwinn
  et al. 2008). Inhibition of mTORC1 reduces S758 phosphorylation on ULK1 (Shang et
