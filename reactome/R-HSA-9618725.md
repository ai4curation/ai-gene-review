stable_id: R-HSA-9618725
display_name: SOX10, EGR2 and NAB proteins bind the GJB1 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GJB1 expression is regulated by two alternate promoters in a tissue specific
  manner.  In Schwann cells, expression is driven by the P2 promoter and depends on
  binding by SOX10, EGR2 and NAB1 or NAB2 (Neuhaus et al, 1996; Bondurand et al, 2001;
  Le et al, 2005; Lopez-Arido et al, 2015).
