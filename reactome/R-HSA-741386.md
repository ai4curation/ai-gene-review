display_name: RIP2 induces K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RIP2 induces the K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO at K285 and K399, positively
  modulating subsequent NF-kappaB activation (Abbot et al. 2007). TRAF6 E3 ligase
  is capable of performing this ubiquitination step when overexpressed in HEK239 cells,
  and this effect is blocked if RIP2 siRNA is co-transfected, but small interfering
  RNA (siRNA) experiments indicate that there are additional E3 ligases that can substitute
  for TRAF6 in NEMO ubiquitination. In addition to TRAF6, the K63-specific E2 ligase
  Ubc13 is required for NEMO ubiquitination suggesting a common mechanism for NEMO
  ubiquitination in NOD and TLR signaling.
