display_name: Interaction of PECAM-1 and SHP-1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The phosphorylation of two tandem tyrosine residues (Y663 and Y686) within
  the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 is required for the downstream signalling events
  observed following PECAM-1 ligation. Both SH2 domains of SHP-1 are required in tandem
  to bind PECAM-1.
