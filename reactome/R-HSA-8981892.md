stable_id: R-HSA-8981892
display_name: Active G alpha (z) binds RGS proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) sense extracellular signals and activate
  different Guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). Upon activation, GPCRs
  can replace the GDP with GTP in the alpha subunit of G proteins. GTP binding modifies
  the conformation of G alpha proteins and activates them. The Regulator of G protein
  Signalling (RGS) are GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs) that can directly inhibit
  the G alpha subunit activity. There are at least 25 different types of RGS proteins
  known. RGS16, RGS17 and RGS20 can bind and stabilize the transition state of Guanine
  nucleotide binding protein G(z) subunit alpha (GNAZ) along its path to GTP hydrolysis.
  Subsequently, this leads to GTP hydrolysis and inactivation of GNAZ, terminating
  downstream signalling (Neubig & Siderovski 2002, Kach et al. 2012, Goto K et al.
  2017). GNAZ inhibits adenylyl cyclase and interacts with Rap1GAP to attenuate Rap1
  signaling.
