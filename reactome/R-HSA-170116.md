display_name: PKMYT1 phosphorylates CCNA:CDK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: <p>PKMYT1 (Myt1), which localizes preferentially to the endoplasmic reticulum
  and Golgi complex, phosphorylates CDK1 (Cdc2) on threonine 14 (T14) ( Liu et al.,
  1997). While the CCNA:CDK2 complex is not inactivated by PKMYT1, PKMYT1 significantly
  reduces histone H1 kinase activity of the CCNA:CDK1 complex as compared with the
  mock-treated lysate or lysate in which CDK1 was replaced with the Cdc2-AF, a mutant
  of CDK2 in which T14 and Y15 are replaced with A and F, respectively (Booher et
  al. 1997). Therefore, it is the CDK subunit and not the cyclin subunit that determines
  whether a CDK:cyclin complex is recognized and phosphorylated by PKMYT1 (Booher
  et al. 1997). In the study of Booher et al. both cyclin A (a synonym for CCNA2)
  and cyclin A1 (CCNA1) complex with CDK2 are mentioned, and it is not clear which
  CCNA isoform or if both isoforms were used. Because of a wider use and ubiquitous
  expression of CCNA2, CCNA2 is annotated as a CCNA set member, while CCNA2 is annotated
  as a set candidate.</p><p>In Drosophila intestinal stem cells and enteroblasts,
  Myt1 depletion promotes ectopic mitoses in a cyclin A:Cdk1-dependent manner, implicating
