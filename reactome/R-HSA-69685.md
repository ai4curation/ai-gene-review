summary: 'CHEK2 (Chk2) phosphorylates TP53 (p53) at serine residue S20 (Hirao et al.
  2000, Shieh et al. 2000, Chehab et al. 2000). Phosphorylation of TP53 at serine
  residue S20 is necessary for DNA damage-induced TP53 stabilization as it compromises
  the interaction of TP53 with the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (Chehab et al. 1999, Chehab
  et al. 2000). S20 phosphorylation is also required for the induction of TP53-dependent
  transcripts in response to DNA damage (Hirao et al. 2000). '
