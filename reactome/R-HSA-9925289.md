stable_id: R-HSA-9925289
display_name: CD274 mRNA binds miR-424 RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA-424 (miR-424) expression, regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia induced
  expression, is observed in human endothelial cells and placental trophoblast (Ghosh
  et al., 2010, Mouillet et al., 2013). It is downregulated in cancers and its high
  expression is related to reversal of chemoresistance via activation of T-cell immune
  response (Xu et al., 2016, Ghafouri-Fard et al., 2024). miR-424 also plays a role
  in the regulation of CD274 (PD-L1) expression. miR-424 bind the 3' UTR region of
  PDL1 mRNA and suppress its expression by inhibiting PDL1 translation (Xu et al.,
  2016, Cao et al., 2020).
