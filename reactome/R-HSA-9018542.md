display_name: NOTCH3 coactivator complex binds DLGAP5 gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NOTCH3 coactivator complex binds the RBPJ (CSL) response elements in the
  promoter of the DLGAP5 gene. Two adjacent CSL-binding motifs in the DLGAP5 promoter,
  which are 6 bp apart, are both necessary for NOTCH3-mediated induction of DLGAP5
  transcription (Chen et al. 2012).
