stable_id: R-HSA-375131
display_name: Basigin binds CD98 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CD97hc is a multifunctional glycoprotein with a single transmembrane domain,
  is highly expressed on proliferating cells, and functions as a chaperone for transporters.
  CD98hc forms disulfide-bonded heterodimers with at least seven different light chains
  (SLC7A5-11) that serve as amino acid transporters. Covalent cross-linking, mass
  spectrometric protein identification, and co-immunoprecipitation shows selective
  CD147 association with CD98hc complex.
