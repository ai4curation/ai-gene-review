display_name: Activation of APC/C:Cdc20 by dissociation of Cdc20:phospho-APC/C from
  Cdc20:phospho-APC/C:Mad2:Bub3:BubR1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: One model ( the direct inhibition model) describing the inhibition of the
  APC/C during the mitotic spindle checkpoint suggests that the association of the
  hBUBR1:hBUB3:MAD2*:CDC20  mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) with APC/C results in
  the inactivation of APC/C. The affinity between MCC and APC/C is not high,  thus
  inhibition is readily reversible when the mitotic spindle checkpoint has been satisfied.

## Summary

One model ( the direct inhibition model) describing the inhibition of the APC/C during the mitotic spindle checkpoint suggests that the association of the hBUBR1:hBUB3:MAD2*:CDC20  mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) with APC/C results in the inactivation of APC/C. The affinity between MCC and APC/C is not high,  thus inhibition is readily reversible when the mitotic spindle checkpoint has been satisfied.
