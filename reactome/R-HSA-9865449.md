display_name: Metallochaperone inserts Cu2+ into MT-CO1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A metallochaperone complex consisting of nine subunits (COA3, COA5, COX10,
  dimeric COX11, COX15, COX16, COX19, SCO1, SCO2) carries a copper cation from the
  outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it was delivered by the copper
  chaperone COX17, to the pre-assembled Complex IV on the inner side of the membrane,
  where it inserts the cation into the MT-CO1 subunit. This copper ion is frequently
  called CuB (Leary et al., 2013; Bode et al., 2015; Nývltová et al., 2022; reviewed
  in Ruiz et al., 2021).
