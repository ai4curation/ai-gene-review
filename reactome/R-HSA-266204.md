display_name: Association of HMGB1/HMGB2 with chromatin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The major HMG-box-containing chromatin proteins HMGB1 and HMGB2 stimulate  DNA
  cleavage by DFF40/CAD (Liu et al., 1998; Toh et al., 1998; Widlak et al., 2000).
  Changes in DNA conformation following  HMG-box binding makes the substrate more
  accessible to cleavage by DFF40/CAD nuclease and thus may contribute to preferential
  linker DNA cleavage during apoptosis (Kalinowska-Herok and Widlak., 2008).

Changes in DNA conformation following  HMG-box binding makes the substrate more accessible to cleavage by DFF40/CAD nuclease and thus may contribute to preferential linker DNA cleavage during apoptosis (Kalinowska-Herok and Widlak., 2008).
