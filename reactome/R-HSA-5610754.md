display_name: GLI3 is partially degraded by the proteasome to yield the GLI3 repressor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'After phosphorylation and ubiquitination, GLI3 is processed by the proteasome
  to an 83-kDa repressor form that lacks the C-terminal activation domain (Wang et
  al, 2000; Tempe et al, 2006; Wang and Li, 2006).  Partial processing appears to
  rely on at least three features of the GLI3 protein: the folded N-terminal zinc
  finger domain, an adjacent simple linker sequence, and the degron in the C-terminus
  that contains the phosphorylation and ubiquitination target residues (Pan and Wang,
  2007; Schrader et al, 2011).  The C-terminal end of the processed repressor form
  is not precisely defined.'

## Summary

After phosphorylation and ubiquitination, GLI3 is processed by the proteasome to an 83-kDa repressor form that lacks the C-terminal activation domain (Wang et al, 2000; Tempe et al, 2006; Wang and Li, 2006).  Partial processing appears to rely on at least three features of the GLI3 protein: the folded N-terminal zinc finger domain, an adjacent simple linker sequence, and the degron in the C-terminus that contains the phosphorylation and ubiquitination target residues (Pan and Wang, 2007; Schrader et al, 2011).  The C-terminal end of the processed repressor form is not precisely defined.
