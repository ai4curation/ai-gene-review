display_name: RAB8 GEFs exchange GTP for GDP on RAB8
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAB8 is involved in trafficking from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the
  plasma membrane, contributes, with RAB10, 13 and 14 to GLUT4 transport, and plays
  a role in the formation of the primary cilium (Huber et al, 1993;  Ishikura et al,
  2008; Sun et al, 2010;  Nachury et al, 2007; Yoshimura et al, 2007; reviewed in
  Hoffman and Elmendorf, 2011; Reiter et al, 2012).  RAB8 also plays a role in regulating
  G2/M transition in complex with Optineurin (OPTN) (Kachaner et al, 2012).<br><br>RAB3IP
  is the best characterized GEF for RAB8A, with established roles in ciliogenesis

  Feng et al, 2012; reviewed in Sung and Leroux, 2013). Other potential RAB8 GEFs
  include RAB3IPL and DENND1C (Yoshimura et al, 2010; reviewed in Ishida et al, 2016).
