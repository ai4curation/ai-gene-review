display_name: IL24:p-IL20RA:p-JAK1:IL20RB binds STAT1,STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta (STAT1) and
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) are believed to bind
  the Interleukin-24 (IL24) receptor complex (Wang et al. 2002, Andoh et al. 2009,
  Parrish-Novak et al. 1998, Li et al. 2013). This is a black box event because STAT3
  binding is inferred from other interleukin receptor ligand interactions where STAT3
  activation is followed by a transient interaction with the receptor complex e.g.Interleukin-10
  receptor (Weber-Nordt et al. 1996).
