summary: Phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  dissociates from the Interleukin-22 (IL22) receptor complex, which consists of IL22,
  phosphorylated Interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha 1 (IL22RA1), phosphorylated
  Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1), Interleukin-10 receptor subunit beta (IL10RB),
  phosphorylated Non-receptor tyrosine protein-kinase TYK2 (TYK2) and Tyrosine protein
  phosphatase non receptor type 11 (PTPN11 or SHP2) and STAT3. This is a black-box
  event because dissociation is inferred from other interleukin signaling cascades
  e.g. Interleukin-10 (Niemand et al. 2003, Braum et al. 2013, Xiong et al. 2014,
  Sheikh et al. 2006) where dissociation occurs before STAT dimerization and translocation
  to the nucleus.

This is a black-box event because dissociation is inferred from other interleukin signaling cascades e.g. Interleukin-10 (Niemand et al. 2003, Braum et al. 2013, Xiong et al. 2014, Sheikh et al. 2006) where dissociation occurs before STAT dimerization and translocation to the nucleus.
