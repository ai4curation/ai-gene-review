display_name: Phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 linker regions by CDK8 or CDK9
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CDK8 in complex with cyclin C (CDK8:CCNC) and CDK9 in complex with cyclin
  T (CDK9:CCNT) are able to phosphorylate the linker region of SMAD2 and SMAD3. In
  SMAD3, CDK8/CDK9 preferentially targets threonine residue T179, although serine
  residues S208 and S213 can also be phosphorylated. In SMAD2, CDK8/9 preferentially
  targets threonine residue T220 (corresponds to T190 in the short isoform of SMAD2,
  SMAD2-2). Phosphorylation of serine residues that correspond to serines S208 and
  S213 of SMAD3 has not been examined. Phosphorylation of the linker region of SMAD2
  and SMAD3 by CDK8/CDK9 enhances transcriptional activity of SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex,
  but also primes SMAD2 and SMAD3 for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Alarcon
  et al. 2009).
