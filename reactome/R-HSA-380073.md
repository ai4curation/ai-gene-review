display_name: Liganded Gi-activating GPCR acts as a GEF for Gi
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The liganded receptor undergoes a conformational change, generating a signal
  that is propagated in a manner that is not completely understood to the G-protein.
  This stimulates the exchange of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit, activating
  the G-protein.<br><br>This event is negatively regulated by some Activators of G
  protein signaling (AGS) proteins, a class of proteins identified in yeast functional
  screens for proteins able to activate G protein signaling in the absence of a G
  protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) (Cismowski et al. 1999, Takesono et al. 1999). AGS
  proteins contain G protein regulatory (GPR) motifs (also referred to as the GoLoco
  motif) that bind and stabilize the Galpha subunit in its GDP-bound conformation
  (Mochizuki et al. 1996, Peterson et al. 2000, Cao et al. 2004, Blumer & Lanier 2014).
  Some RGS proteins similarly bind to Galpha preventing the exchange of GDP for GTP
  (Soundararajan et al. 2008).
