summary: 'Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL1RAPL1) belongs to the
  interleukin-1/Toll receptor family. It has extracellular Ig-like domains and an
  intracellular Toll/IL1R (TIR) domain. It regulates synapse formation of cortical
  neurons. Trans-synaptic interaction between postsynaptic IL1RAPL1 and presynaptic
  Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase delta (PTPRD) bidirectionally regulates
  excitatory synapse development. IL1RAPL2 is related to IL1RAPL1 and may also function
  in excitatory synapse organization although with less potency than IL1RAPL1 (Yoshida
  et al. 2011, Valnegri et al. 2011).


  IL1RAPL1 is associated with cognitive diseases ranging from nonsyndromic X-linked
  mental retardation to autism (Hayashi et al. 2013, Piton et al. 2008, Carrie et
  al. 1999).'

## Summary

Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL1RAPL1) belongs to the interleukin-1/Toll receptor family. It has extracellular Ig-like domains and an intracellular Toll/IL1R (TIR) domain. It regulates synapse formation of cortical neurons. Trans-synaptic interaction between postsynaptic IL1RAPL1 and presynaptic Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase delta (PTPRD) bidirectionally regulates excitatory synapse development. IL1RAPL2 is related to IL1RAPL1 and may also function in excitatory synapse organization although with less potency than IL1RAPL1 (Yoshida et al. 2011, Valnegri et al. 2011).
