summary: Heat-shock 70kDa proteins (HSP70s) are a family of conserved, ubiquitously
  expressed heat-shock proteins which play important roles in protein folding and
  in protecting cells from stress. They possess three functional domains; an N-terminal
  ATPase domain, a substrate binding domain and a C-terminal domain. HSP70s are bound
  to either ATP or ADP. In the ATP-bound state, HSP70s do not interact with a substrate
  peptide as the C-terminal domain (which acts as a lid) is "open", allowing peptides
  to bind to the substrate binding domain but then be released very rapidily. However,
  a substrate peptide in the binding domain can stimulate the intrinsic ATPase activity
  of HSP70s, hydrolysing ATP to ADP. With ADP bound, the C-terminal domain of HSP70s
  closes around the peptide, effectively trapping the peptide.<br><br>Intrinsic ATPase
  activity proceeds relatively slowly but can be dramatically increased by binding
  of J-domain chaperones such as HSP40s. These are eukaryotic orthologues of the DnaJ
  cochaperones found in prokaryotes. The human HSP40s that are able to modulate intrinsic
  ATPase activity of HSP70s are DNAJB1, B6, C2 and C7 (Raabe & Manley 1991, Melville
  et al. 1999, Hanai & Mashima 2003, Izawa et al. 2000, Hundley et al. 2005, Brychzy
  et al. 2003). They are also able to co-localise to the nucleus with HSP70s upon
  heat-shock (Hattori et al. 1992).
