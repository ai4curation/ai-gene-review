species: Homo sapiens
summary: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a major ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)
  found in fish oil is the source of E-series resolvins, one of the specialized proresolving
  mediators (SPMs) that show potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions (Molfino
  et al. 2017, Calder 2017). The initial transformation of EPA can be mediated by
  either cytochrome P450s or aspirin-acetylated cyclooxygenase-2, resulting in 18(R)-
  and 18(S)-stereospecific E-resolvins. Combinations of oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis
  reactions determine the type of E-resolvin formed (RvE1, RvE2 or RvE3) (Serhan &
  Petasis 2011).  Aspirin acetylation of cyclooxygenase isoforms results in changed
  activities. Acetylation of cyclooxygenase-1 results in its inhibition and thereby
  halting production of inflammatory mediators. However, acetylation of cyclooxygenase-2
  transforms its enzyme activity from a cyclooxygenase to a lipoxygenase, thereby
  blocking prostaglandin biosynthesis and, additionally, initiating the production
  of SPMs (Arita et al. 2005, Kyriakopoulos et al. 2017). The biosynthesis of 18(R)
  E-resolvins is described here.
