summary: HNP-1 is recognized as a substrate by arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase-1
  which ribosylates Arg-14 of the peptide. The modified defensin has reduced antimicrobial
  and cytotoxic activities but its chemotactic properties remain unchanged whilst
  its ability to induced the chemokine IL-8 is enhanced.

## Summary

HNP-1 is recognized as a substrate by arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase-1 which ribosylates Arg-14 of the peptide. The modified defensin has reduced antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities but its chemotactic properties remain unchanged whilst its ability to induced the chemokine IL-8 is enhanced.
