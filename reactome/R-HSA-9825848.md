stable_id: R-HSA-9825848
display_name: MITF-M dimer, SOX10, pS133 CREB1 and CTNNB1:LEF1 bind the DCT promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upregulation of DCT expression during melanogenesis depends on the binding
  of MITF-M to M- and E-box elements in its promoter, as assessed by reporter gene
  assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation
  (ChIP) (Lowings et al, 1992; Bertolotto et al, 1998a, b; Yavuzer et al, 1995; Lang
  et al, 2005; Strub et al, 2011). MITF-M appears to compete with PAX3 for binding
  at the DCT promoter, allowing a switch from the repressive PAX3:LEF1:TLE4 complex
  (Lang et al, 2005). Expression is additionally stimulated downstream of cAMP signaling
  by the binding of CREB1 to its cognate site (Bertolotto et al, 1998a), and through
  the concerted binding of SOX10, LEF1 and CTNNB1 (Ludwig et al, 2004, Yasumoto et
  al, 2002; Lang et al, 2005; reviewed in Cheli et al, 2010).
