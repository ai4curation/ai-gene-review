species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'UNC-5 uses DCC as a co-receptor and binds to the DCC P1 domain with its
  DB domain to repel axons at low netrin concentration. It is generally thought that
  UNC5 receptor alone transduces short range signals whereas DCC-Unc5 complex transduces
  long range signals important for neuron migration, neurite growth and axon repulsion. '

## Summary

UNC-5 uses DCC as a co-receptor and binds to the DCC P1 domain with its DB domain to repel axons at low netrin concentration. It is generally thought that UNC5 receptor alone transduces short range signals whereas DCC-Unc5 complex transduces long range signals important for neuron migration, neurite growth and axon repulsion.
