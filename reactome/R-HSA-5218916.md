species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated MAP kinase-activated protein kinase (MAPK/MAPKAPK) 2 and 3 in turn
  phosphorylate heat shock protein beta 1 (HSPB1, HSP27). HSP27 is an actin-capping
  protein. Its phosphorylation has been proposed to release it from actin filaments,
  thus allowing addition of actin monomers and elongation of filaments. Phosphorylation-induced
  conformational changes causes disaggregation of oligomeric complexes of HSP27 and
  subsequent disassociation from actin filaments, which may result in a higher rate
  of actin polymerization (Lamalice et al. 2007, Rousseau et al. 2000, Lavoie et al.
  1995).
