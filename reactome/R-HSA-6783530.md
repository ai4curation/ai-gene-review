display_name: gp130:JAKs bind CNTFR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Members of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokines, IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory
  factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM) cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) and cardiotrophin-like cytokine
  (CLC) share one or both of the receptor signal transducing subunits glycoprotein
  (gp) 130 and LIFR in their respective receptor complexes (Taga et al. 1997). gp130
  (also known as CD130) is the central signal transducer of the interleukin-6 (IL6)-related
  cytokines. It is expressed in almost all organs, including heart, kidney, spleen,
  liver, lung, placenta, and brain. Mice lacking gp130 gene results in embryonic lethality
  at day 12.5 (Yoshida et al. 1996). CNTFR alpha bound to CNTFR or CLCF1:CRLF1 complex
  recruits gp130 by binding to the cytokine-binding domain (CBD) of gp130 (Man et
  al. 2003).
