species: Homo sapiens
summary: G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) sense extracellular signals and activate
  different Guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). Upon activation, GPCRs
  can replace the GDP with GTP in the alpha subunit of G proteins. GTP binding modifies
  the conformation of G alpha proteins and activates them. The Regulator of G protein
  Signalling (RGS) are GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs) that can directly inhibit
  the G alpha subunit activity. There are at least 25 different types of RGS proteins
  known. Several of these RGS proteins (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
  16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21) can bind and stabilize the transition state of Guanine nucleotide
  binding protein G(i) subunit alpha (GNAI). Following this, the RGS domain of the
  proteins exert GAP activity on GNAI and allosterically modulate residues within
  G-alpha subunit to accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity that hydrolyses GTP
  to GDP.  This inactivates GNAI and terminates downstream signalling (Neubig & Siderovski
  2002, Kach et al. 2012).

## Summary

G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) sense extracellular signals and activate different Guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). Upon activation, GPCRs can replace the GDP with GTP in the alpha subunit of G proteins. GTP binding modifies the conformation of G alpha proteins and activates them. The Regulator of G protein Signalling (RGS) are GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs) that can directly inhibit the G alpha subunit activity. There are at least 25 different types of RGS proteins known. Several of these RGS proteins (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21) can bind and stabilize the transition state of Guanine nucleotide binding protein G(i) subunit alpha (GNAI).
