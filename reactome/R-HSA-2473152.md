species: Homo sapiens
summary: Acetyltransferases ESCO1 and ESCO2 are homologs of the S. cerevisiae acetyltransferase
  Eco1, essential for viability in yeast. ESCO1 and ESCO2 share sequence homology
  in the C-terminal region, consisting of a H2C2 zinc finger motif and an acetyltransferase
  domain (Hou and Zou 2005). Both ESCO1 and ESCO2 acetylate the cohesin subunit SMC3
  on two lysine residues, K105 and K106 (Zhang et al. 2008), an important step in
  the establishment of sister-chromatid cohesion during the S-phase of the cell cycle.
  Divergent N-termini of ESCO1 and ESCO2, necessary for chromatin binding, suggest
  that ESCO1 and ESCO2 may perform distinct functions in sister chromatid cohesion
  (Hou and Zou 2005). Several studies suggest that ESCO2 may be predominantly involved
  in acetylation of the SMC3 subunit of centromeric cohesin. A conditional targeting
  of Esco2 locus in mice leads to pre-implantational loss of homozygous Esco2 -/-
  embryos at the eight-cell stage. Prometaphase chromosomes isolated from two-cell
  stage Esco2 knockout embryos show marked cohesion defect at centromeres (Whelan
  et al. 2012). ESCO2 protein appears in the S-phase (Hou and Zou 2005, Whelan et
  al. 2012) and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts Esco2 predominantly localizes to pericentric
  heterochromatin (Whelan et al. 2012). Mutations in the ESCO2 gene (Vega et al. 2005)
  that impair ESCO2 acetyltransferase activity (Gordillo et al. 2008) are the cause
  of the Roberts syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by craniofacial
  and limb abnormalities, and intellectual disability. Metaphase chromosomes of Roberts
  syndrome patients exhibit loss of cohesion at heterochromatic regions of centromeres
  and the Y chromosome, with a characteristic 'railroad track appearance' (Van den
  Berg and Francke 1993, Vega et al. 2005).
