## Summary

Antigen receptor triggered PKC theta dependent linker phosphorylation of S559 residue is required to release this inhibition and expose the CARD motif for downstream Bcl10 recruitment (Sommer et al. 2005). PDK1 and maybe other unknown adapter proteins bring PKC theta and CARMA1 into close proximity, facilitating PKC theta mediated CARMA1 phosphorylation and consequent activation.
