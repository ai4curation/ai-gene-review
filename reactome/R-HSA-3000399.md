stable_id: R-HSA-3000399
display_name: RANBP2 SUMOylates SP100 with SUMO1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RANBP2 SUMOylates SP100 with SUMO1 at lysine-297 (Pichler et al. 2002, Tatham
  et al. 2005). RANBP2 has a binding site for SUMO1 and a binding site for UBE2I (UBC9)
  which may recruit the SUMO1:UBE2I (SUMO1:UBC9) complex (Tatham et al. 2005). RANBP2
  is located on the cytoplasmic filaments of the nuclear pore so that SUMOylation
  may occur during nuclear import of SP100 (Pichler et al. 2002)
