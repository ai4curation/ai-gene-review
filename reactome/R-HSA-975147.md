display_name: Auto ubiquitination of oligo-TRAF6 bound to p-IRAK2 at endosome membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRAF6 possesses ubiquitin ligase activity and undergoes K-63-linked auto-ubiquitination
  after its oligomerization. In the first step, ubiquitin is activated by an E1 ubiquitin
  activating enzyme. The activated ubiquitin is transferred to a E2 conjugating enzyme
  (a heterodimer of proteins Ubc13 and Uev1A) forming the E2-Ub thioester. Finally,
  in the presence of ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 (TRAF6, a RING-domain E3), ubiquitin
  is attached to the target protein (TRAF6 on residue Lysine 124) through an isopeptide
  bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine
  residue in the target protein. In contrast to K-48-linked ubiquitination that leads
  to the proteosomal degradation of the target protein, K-63-linked polyubiquitin
  chains act as a scaffold to assemble protein kinase complexes and mediate their
  activation through proteosome-independent mechanisms. This K63 polyubiquitinated
  TRAF6 activates the TAK1 kinase complex.

## Summary

TRAF6 possesses ubiquitin ligase activity and undergoes K-63-linked auto-ubiquitination after its oligomerization. In the first step, ubiquitin is activated by an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme. The activated ubiquitin is transferred to a E2 conjugating enzyme (a heterodimer of proteins Ubc13 and Uev1A) forming the E2-Ub thioester.
