stable_id: R-HSA-77589
display_name: Recognition of AAUAAA sequence by CPSF
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Poly(A) polymerase has no specificity for any particular RNA sequence, as
  well as a very low affinity for the RNA. Under physiological conditions, the activity
  of poly(A) polymerase depends on two auxiliary factors, both of which bind to specific
  RNA sequences and recruit the poly(A) polymerase by a direct contact. One of these
  proteins is the heterotetrameric CPSF, which binds the AAUAAA sequence and is also
  essential for 3' cleavage.
