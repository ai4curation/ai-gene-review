species: Homo sapiens
summary: Natural killer (NK) cells express a multitude of activating and inactivating
  cell surface receptors through which they recognise tumors and infected cells. Among
  the activating receptors, the family of Ig-like molecules is termed natural cytotoxicity
  receptors (NCRs). These NCRs include Natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 1
  (NCR1 also referred as NKp46 or LY94), Natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor
  2 (NCR2 also referred as NKp44) and Natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 3 (NCR3
  also referred as NKp30 ) (Hecht et al. 2009). All three NCRs are involved in the
  elimination of both tumor and virus infected cells. NCRs are coupled to different
  signal transducing adaptor proteins, including CD3zeta, FCER1G, and KARAP/DAP12.
  <br>NCR1 (NKp46) is selectively expressed by all resting and activated human NK
  cells (Sivori et al. 1997). NCRI recognises and targets the direct killing of virus-infected
  cells. The antiviral activity is initiated by the interaction of NCR1 with hemagglutinin
  of influenza virus or Sendai virus (Mandelboim et al. 2001). Biochemical analysis
  revealed that NCR1 molecules are coupled with associated adaptor proteins CD3z and
  FCERIG that contain immune tyrosine-based activating motifs (ITAM) (Moretta et al.
  2001).
