display_name: Formation of Pre-Integration Complex (PIC)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Concomitant with the completion of reverse transcription, the pre-integration
  complex is formed by shedding of some viral proteins from the viral core, and binding
  of cellular proteins, thereby yielding complexes capable of integration. The terminal
  cleavage reaction takes place in the cytoplasm, where two nucleotides are removed
  from each viral DNA 3' end.  This serves to remove heterogeneous extra bases from
  the viral DNA ends occasionally added by reverse transcription, thereby yielding
  a homogeneous substrate for downstream steps, and also serves to stablilize the
  PIC. The DNA in PICs is considerably compacted relative to its length when fully
  extended, probably due to binding of proteins in addition to the viral integrase.
  These proteins are not fully clarified, due to the difficulty of biochemical  analysis
  of small amounts of material, but candidates include the viral NC and MA proteins,
  and the cellular HMGA, BAF, and PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 proteins. Purified integrase is
  capable of carrying out the terminal cleavage and initial strand transfer reactions.
