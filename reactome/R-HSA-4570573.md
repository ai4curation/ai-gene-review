stable_id: R-HSA-4570573
display_name: Defective RFT1 does not flip the N-glycan precursor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The N-glycan precursor is flipped across the ER membrane, moving it from
  the cytosolic side to the ER lumenal side. The exact mechanism of this translocation
  is not well understood but protein RFT1 homolog (RFT1) is known to be involved  (Helenius
  et al. 2002). Defects in RFT1 are associated with congenital disorder of glycosylation
  1n (RFT1-CDG, CDG-1n). The disease is a multi-system disorder characterised by under-glycosylated
  serum glycoproteins. Early-onset developmental retardation, dysmorphic features,
  hypotonia, coagulation disorders and immunodeficiency are reported features of this
  disorder. In a patient with RFT1-CDG, Haeuptle et al. identified a homozygous C-T
  transition at nucleotide 199, resulting in a substitution of cysteine for arginine
  at codon 67 (R67C) (Haeuptle et al. 2008).
