stable_id: R-HSA-9929884
display_name: CCNA:CDK1 phosphorylates HJURP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HJURP (Holliday junction recognition protein), a centromeric protein required
  for the incorporation of newly synthesized CENPA molecules into nucleosomes at replicated
  centromeres (Foltz et al. 2009, Dunleavy et al. 2009), was identified as a CCNA:CDK2
  target in a high-throughput screen (Dumitru et al. 2017). HJURP was shown to be
  phosphorylated at G2, at least on two CDK consensus sites, S211 and S412, at a time
  that correlates with high CDK1 activity, and that it binds to CCNA2, and, to a lesser
  extent, to CCNB (Stankovic et al. 2017). The interaction with CCNA2 is required
  for the CDK-mediated inhbition of an untimely recruitment of HJURP to the centromere
  (Stankovic et al. 2017).
