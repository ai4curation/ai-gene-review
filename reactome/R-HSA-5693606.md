display_name: DNA Double Strand Break Response
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DNA double-strand break (DSB) response involves sensing of DNA DSBs by the
  MRN complex which triggers ATM activation. ATM phosphorylates a number of proteins
  involved in DNA damage checkpoint signaling, as well as proteins directly involved
  in the repair of DNA DSBs. For a recent review, please refer to Ciccia and Elledge,
  2010.
