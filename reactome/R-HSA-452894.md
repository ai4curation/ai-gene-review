stable_id: R-HSA-452894
display_name: Expression of SOX2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The SOX2 gene is transcribed to yield mRNA and the mRNA is translated to
  yield protein (Rao et al. 2004, Richards et al. 2004). SOX2 protein is expressed
  in the cytoplasm of oocytes and day-2 cleavage-stage embryos and in the nuclei of
  all cells  of the inner cell mass of blastocysts (Cauffman et al. 2009). POU5F1
  (OCT4), SOX2, and NANOG bind the promoter of the SOX2 gene and enhance transcription
  (Chew et al. 2005, Boyer et al. 2005, Babaie et al. 2007, Assou et al. 2007, Greber
  et al. 2007). POU5F1 and SOX2 bind adjacent sites at the promoter and form a heterodimer
  on the DNA (Boyer et al. 2005). Hypoxia acts via HIF3A and EPAS1 (HIF2A) to activate
  expression of SOX2 (Forristal et al. 2010).
