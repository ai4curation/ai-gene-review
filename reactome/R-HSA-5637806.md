summary: 'Based on the wild-type EGFR signaling, it is assumed that the guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor SOS1 interacts with phosphorylated EGFRvIII mutant through the adaptor
  protein, GRB2. Upon formation of this complex, SOS1 activates RAS by promoting GDP
  release and GTP binding. Although this reaction has not been directly confirmed
  for EGFRvIII cancer mutant, RAS-MAPK signaling cascade is activated in cells expressing
  EGFRvIII (Montgomery et al.1995). '

## Summary

Based on the wild-type EGFR signaling, it is assumed that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS1 interacts with phosphorylated EGFRvIII mutant through the adaptor protein, GRB2. Upon formation of this complex, SOS1 activates RAS by promoting GDP release and GTP binding. Although this reaction has not been directly confirmed for EGFRvIII cancer mutant, RAS-MAPK signaling cascade is activated in cells expressing EGFRvIII (Montgomery et al.1995).
