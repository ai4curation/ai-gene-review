display_name: Beta-catenin recruits TRRAP/KAT5 HAT components
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Pulldown experiments in colorectal cancer cells show an interaction between
  the C-terminal region of beta-catenin (ARM domains 11 and 12 through the C terminal)
  with a number of TRRAP-KAT5 HAT complex members including TRRAP, TIP49, p400 and
  KAT5 (TIP60), among others (Sierra et al, 2006; Bauer et al, 1998; Bauer et al,
  2000; Feng et al, 2003).  KAT5 and TIP49 have been shown to directly regulate WNT
  target genes in vivo and are associated with increased H4 acetylation (Bauer et
  al, 2000; Feng et al, 2003; Kim et al, 2005).
