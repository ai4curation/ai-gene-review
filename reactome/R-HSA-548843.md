stable_id: R-HSA-548843
display_name: ACSL3,4 ligate CoA to AA to form AA-CoA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) associated with the
  endoplasmic reticulum membrane catalyses the conjugation of arachidonate (AA) with
  CoA to form arachidonyl-CoA (AA-CoA) (Longo et al. 2003, Meloni et al. 2003). By
  similarity, ACSL3 can also preferentially conjugate CoA on to AA (Yao & Ye 2008).
  These enzymes are involved in the activation of long-chain fatty acids for both
  synthesis of cellular lipids, and degradation via beta-oxidation.
