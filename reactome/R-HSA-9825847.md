display_name: MITF-M dimer and the SWI/SNF complex bind the TYRP1 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MITF-M binds to the promoter of the TYRP1 gene to stimulate expression as
  assessed by reporter gene assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and
  chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (Bertolotto et al, 1998a, b; Fang et al, 2002;
  De la Serna et al, 2006; reviewed in Cheli et al, 2010). Promoter recognition is
  mediated by an M-box (located between position -49 and -39 in human, -44 and -33
  in mouse) and a related E-box (position -238 to -233 in mouse) (Bertolotto et al,
  1998a; Fang et al, 2002). Expression is also stimulated by the MITF-M-dependent
  recruitment of a SWI/SNF complex as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation of SMARCA4
  (BRG1), SMARCE1 (INI1) and SMARCB1 (BAF57) in mouse, and in an additional study
  with SMARCD1 (de la Serna et al, 2006; Keenen et al, 2010; Aras et al, 2019).
