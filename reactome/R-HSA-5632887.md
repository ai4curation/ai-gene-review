display_name: TP53 binds the RRM2B gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TP53 (p53) binds the p53-binding site in the first intron of RRM2B (p53R2)
  gene, which encodes a subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase complex (Tanaka et
  al. 2000). RRM2B is also regulated by TP73 (p73), a p53 family member (Nakano et
  al. 2000).
