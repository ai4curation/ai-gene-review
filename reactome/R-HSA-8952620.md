display_name: NEDD8:AcM-UBE2M binds CRL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'UBE2M is the E2 for CRL complexes containing cullin 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Huang
  et al, 2009; Monda et al, 2013).  Interaction between UBE2M and the CUL1 E3 complex
  is facilitated by a DCUN1D (also known as DCNL) scaffold protein, of which there
  are 5 in human cells (Kim et al, 2008; Kurz et al, 2008; Meyer-Schaller et al, 2009;
  Monda et al, 2013; Keuss et al, 2016). DCUN1D proteins interact with higher affinity
  to the N-terminally acetylated forms of UBE2F and UBE2M (Scott et al, 2011; Monda
  et al, 2013). Although each of the 5 DCUN1D proteins appears to interact with most
  cullin subtypes, specificity may arise through differences in expression and localization,
  and DCUN1D3 may play a specialized role in sequestering CRL E3 ligase complexes
  at the cell membrane (Monda et al, 2013; Keuss et al, 2016; Meyer-Schaller et al,
  2009; Huang et al, 2014; reviewed in Enchev et al, 2103). Although in this pathway,
  COMMD proteins and DCUN1D are shown acting sequentially in the activation of the
  CRL E3 ligase complex, the relationship between these protein families is not totally
  clear, as DCUN1D proteins have been identified in complexes that also contain the
  inhibitor CAND1 (Kim et al, 2008; Huang et al, 2014).

  Target specificity of the CRL1 complex is directed by the nature of the F box substrate
  recognition protein, of which there are more than 60 in humans. Identified targets
  of CRL1-containing complexes include signaling molecules, transcriptional regulators
  and regulators of cell cycle progression, among others (reviewed in Gutierrez and
  Ronai, 2006; Lipkowitz and Weissman, 2011). CRL1 complexes are also hijacked by
  a number of viruses, redirecting the ubiquitin ligase complex to target host proteins
  and in this way promoting viral propagation (reveiwed in Mahon et al, 2014).'
