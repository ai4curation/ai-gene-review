species: Homo sapiens
summary: Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα, NR3A1, nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group A
  member 1), encoded by the ESR1 gene, is a nuclear hormone receptor that is activated
  by the sex hormone estrogen. ESR1 can mediate the physiological development and
  function of various organ systems, including the reproductive, central nervous,
  skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Accordingly, ESR1 is widely expressed throughout
  the body.<br><br>Synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen agonists are used to treat a variety
  of gynecological disorders (Stauffer et al. 2000, Sasson 1991, Kuiper et al. 1997).
  Diethylstilbestrol was previously used in the prevention of miscarriage or premature
  delivery but later only used in the treatment of prostate or breast cancer. Ethinylestradiol,
  when combined with progestins, is mainly used as a contraceptive and for certain
  menopausal conditions.<br><br>Tamoxifen has mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic
  activity, dependent on tissue type. For instance, tamoxifen has predominantly antiestrogenic
  effects in breast tissue (Wang et al. 2004) but predominantly estrogenic effects
  in the uterus and liver. Tamoxifen was indicated to treat estrogen receptor positive
  metastatic breast cancer in adults but has since been superceded by aromatase inhibitors
  such as anastrozole (Howell et al. 2005). A beneficial side effect of tamoxifen
  is that it prevents osteoporosis by acting as an agonist in bone cells (Kassem 1997).
  Tibolone is an estrogen receptor agonist with a preference for ESR1 (Escande et
  al. 2009). It is indicated for the relief of post-menopausal symptoms and for the
  prevention of osteoporosis.
