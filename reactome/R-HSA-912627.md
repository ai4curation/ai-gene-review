stable_id: R-HSA-912627
display_name: CBL ubiquitinates PI3K
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cbl is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that negatively regulates signaling
  pathways by targeting proteins for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Rao
  et al. 2002). Cbl-B targets PI3K for ubiquitination and degradation in T cells (Fang
  et al. 2000). Similarly, Cbl activation by tyrosine phosphorylation increases PI3K
  ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Dufour et al. 2008).
