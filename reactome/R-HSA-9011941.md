display_name: Estrogen-responsive BCL2 gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ESR1 and HIST1H2AC contribute to estrogen-responsive transcriptional activation
  at the BCL and MYC genes by promoting long-range chromatin loops between enhancer
  elements.  This is accompanied by the recruitment of EP300 and RNA polymerase II  (Su
  et al, 2014).
