display_name: NOTCH1 HD domain mutants are cleaved to produce NEXT1 irrespective of
  ligand binding
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'When the gamma-secretase complex is inhibited, the transmembrane fragment
  of NOTCH1 HD domain mutants that corresponds in size to ADAM10/17 cleavage product
  NEXT1 accumulates in treated cells. This serves as indirect evidence of cleavage
  of NOTCH1 heterodimerization domain mutants by ADAM10/17 metalloprotease(s). Importantly,
  in the case of NOTCH1 HD domain mutants, NEXT1 fragment, as well as the gamma-secretase
  cleavage product NICD1, are detectable in the absence of DLL/JAG ligand binding.
  Therefore, NOTCH1 HD domain mutants, although capable of and responsive to ligand
  binding, are constitutively active because of S2 site cleavage by ADAM10/17 in the
  absence of ligand. The constitutive S2 site cleavage of NOTCH1 HD domain mutants
  could be due to their altered conformation or due to increased rate of spontaneous
  dissociation of NOTCH1 extracellular and transmembrane subunits (Malecki et al.
  2006). Both of these scenarios could make the S2 site constitutively accessible
  to ADAM10/17, but the exact mechanism has not been established. '
