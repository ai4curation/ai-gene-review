display_name: Activation of IKK by MEKK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In Human, IKKs - IkB kinase (IKK) complex serves as the master regulator
  for the activation of NF-kB by various stimuli. It contains two catalytic subunits,
  IKK alpha and IKK beta, and a regulatory subunit, IKKgamma/NEMO. The activation
  of IKK complex and NFkB mediated antiviral responce are dependent on the phosphorylation
  of IKK alpha/beta at its activation loop and the ubiquitination of NEMO.[Solt et
  al 2009]; [Li et al 2002]. NEMO ubiquitination by TRAF6 is required for optimal
  activation of IKKalpha/beta; it's remained unclear if NEMO subunit undergoes K63-linked
  or linear ubiquitination.<br><br>This basic trimolecular complex is referred to
  as the IKK complex. Each catalytic IKK subunit has a N-term kinase domain a leucine
  zipper (LZ) motifs, a helix-loop-helix (HLH) and a C-ter NEMO binding domain (NBD).
  IKK catalytic subunits are dimerized through their LZ motifs.<br><br>IKK beta is
  the major IKK catalytic subunit for NF-kB activation. MEKK1 can activate both IKK-alpha
  (IKKA) and IKK-beta (IKKB) in vivo. MEKK1 phosphorylates Ser-176 and Ser-180 in
  IKKA and Ser-177 and Ser-181 in IKKB activation loop and thus activate the IKK kinase
  activity, leading to the IkB alpha phosphorylation and NF-kB activation.
