stable_id: R-HSA-422051
display_name: Cleavage of the signal peptide of Preproghrelin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The N-terminal 23 amino acid residues are cleaved from preproghrelin by the
  signal peptidase complex. The products are proghrelin (94 amino acid residues) or
  des-acyl-Gln14 proghrelin (93 amino acid residues), depending on the variant of
  the mRNA that was translated.
