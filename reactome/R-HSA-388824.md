stable_id: R-HSA-388824
display_name: PTPRF, PTPRS, PTPRD bind Liprins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: All the three LAR-RPTP transmembrane tyrosine phosphatases associate with
  liprin proteins and colocalize with liprin-alpha1 at the proximal edges of focal
  adhesions. Based on sequence similarities and binding characteristics, liprins are
  subdivided into alpha-type and beta-type liprins. The C-terminal, non-coiled coil
  regions of alpha-liprins bind to the membrane-distal phosphatase domains of LAR
  family members, as well as to the C-terminal, non-coiled coil region of beta-liprins.
  Liprin is required for normal presynaptic differentiation in C. elegans and controls
  synapse morphogenesis in Drosophila. In mammalian synapses the functional significance
  of liprin and LAR-RPTP interaction is unknown (Pages et al. 1998, Dunah et al. 2005).
