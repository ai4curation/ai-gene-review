display_name: Formation of the inner ring of the 20S thymoproteasome core particle
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'In the thymoproteasomes, expressed exclusively in cortical thymic epithelial
  cells in the thymus, the 20S core particle (20S tCP) inner ring proteolytic subunits,
  PSMB6 (beta-1), PSBM7 (beta-2), and PSMB5 (beta-5), are replaced with PSMB9 (beta-1i),
  PSMB10 (beta-2i) and PSMB11 (beta-5t) , respectively (Murata et al. 2007: endogenous
  mouse proteins; Bai et al. 2014: recombinant human proteins). The order of incorporation
  of beta subunits in thymoproteasomes likely differs from the order of incorporation
  in the canonical 20S CPs (Bai et al. 2014). Thymoproteasomes appear to increase
  the repertoire of self peptides for positive selection during T cell development
  in the thymus (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013).'

## Summary

In the thymoproteasomes, expressed exclusively in cortical thymic epithelial cells in the thymus, the 20S core particle (20S tCP) inner ring proteolytic subunits, PSMB6 (beta-1), PSBM7 (beta-2), and PSMB5 (beta-5), are replaced with PSMB9 (beta-1i), PSMB10 (beta-2i) and PSMB11 (beta-5t) , respectively (Murata et al. 2007: endogenous mouse proteins; Bai et al. 2014: recombinant human proteins). The order of incorporation of beta subunits in thymoproteasomes likely differs from the order of incorporation in the canonical 20S CPs (Bai et al. 2014). Thymoproteasomes appear to increase the repertoire of self peptides for positive selection during T cell development in the thymus (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013).
