display_name: 'ERGIC-to-Golgi vesicles bind dynein:dynactin '
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Unlike COPII-mediated traffic from the ER, COPI traffic to the Golgi is microtubule-
  and dynein-dependent (Scales et al, 1997; Presley et al, 1997; Ben-Tekaya et al,
  2005). Recruitment of the dynein:dynactin complex may in turn rely on interaction
  with the ankyrin-spectrin network, which may contact integral membrane cargo proteins
  as they are incorporated into nascent COPI vesicles (Devarajan et al, 1997; Godi
  et al, 1998; Holleran et al, 1996; Holleran et al, 2001). Although not depicted
  in this reaction, dynein-dependent vesicle transport is energy dependent.
