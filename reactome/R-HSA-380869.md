stable_id: R-HSA-380869
display_name: Release of docked dopamine loaded synaptic vesicle
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The trimeric complex formed between V-SNARE (VAMP) and the T-SNAREs (syntaxin
  and SNAP 25) after priming step is called transSNARE complex because the members
  of each group lie on the opposide side of the membrane, plasmamembrane side and
  the vesicular membrane side. Ca2+ influx through the Voltage gated Calcium Channels
  (VGCC) initaites the process of fusion of the synaptic vesicle in the presynaptic
  cell. The rise in Ca2+ leads to the activation of Protein Kinase A through rise
  in cAMP. Synaptotagmin, a Ca2+ sensor proetin also plays a role in the fusion process.
  Following fusion the members of V and T SNARES lie on the same membrane formin the
  cis-SNARES. The fusion of release causes the release of the neurotransmitter into
  the synaptic cleft.
