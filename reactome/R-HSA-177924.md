summary: Phosphorylated GAB1 can bind PI3 kinase by its regulatory alpha subunit.
  SHP2 dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residues 447, 472 and 589 on GAB1 means PI3
  kinase can no longer bind to the complex in the plasma membrane and cannot be activated.

**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

Phosphorylated GAB1 can bind PI3 kinase by its regulatory alpha subunit. SHP2 dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residues 447, 472 and 589 on GAB1 means PI3 kinase can no longer bind to the complex in the plasma membrane and cannot be activated.
