display_name: The complex of ATR and ATRIP is recruited to ICL-DNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The complex of ATR and ATRIP (ATR:ATRIP) is recruited to replication forks
  blocked by DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL-DNA) through interaction with the RPA
  complex and the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex. The RPA heterotrimer associates
  both with single strand DNA (ssDNA) that is produced by DNA resection at ICL-DNA-stalled
  replication forks and with the FANCM and FAAP24 components of the FA core complex
  (Huang et al. 2010). ATRIP directly interacts with the FANCL component of the FA
  core complex (Tomida et al. 2013). The presence of RAD17 and TOPB1, which is required
  for ATR activation at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), is not needed for ATR activation
  at ICL-DNA (Tomida et al. 2013).
