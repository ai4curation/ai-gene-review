summary: 'Interleukin-35 (IL35) binding activates the IL35 receptor complex and facilitates

## Summary

Interleukin-35 (IL35) binding activates the IL35 receptor complex and facilitates JAKs phosphorylation. Subsequently, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4-alpha/beta (STAT4) binds to the receptor complex and is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (Collison et al. 2012). This is a black box event because the receptor subunit responsible for STAT4 binding to the receptor is unclear.
