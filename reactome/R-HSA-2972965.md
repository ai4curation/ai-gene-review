display_name: POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG bind the TSC22D1 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, and NANOG bind the promoter of the TSC22D1 gene (Boyer
  et al. 2005, Lister et al. 2009) and POU5F1 (Babaie et al. 2007, Greber et al. 2007,
  Kunarso et al. 2010), SOX2 (Greber et al. 2007), and NANOG (Greber et al. 2007)
  repress expression. TSC22D1 promotes TGFbeta-mediated cardiac myofibroblast differentiation
  (Yan et al. 2011), regulates hematopoietic cell proliferation (inferred from mouse
  in Yu et al. 2009), and associates with Smad4 to induce erythroid cell differentiation
  (inferred from mouse in Choi et al. 2005).

TSC22D1 promotes TGFbeta-mediated cardiac myofibroblast differentiation (Yan et al. 2011), regulates hematopoietic cell proliferation (inferred from mouse in Yu et al. 2009), and associates with Smad4 to induce erythroid cell differentiation (inferred from mouse in Choi et al. 2005).
