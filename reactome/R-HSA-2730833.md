display_name: Phosphorylation of TEC kinases by p-SYK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BTK/ITK are activated in a two step model. In the first step they are recruited
  to the membrane by binding to PIP3 or, alternatively with other binding partners
  like SLP-76. Once at the membrane SYK or Src-kinases in the vicinity phosphorylates
  Y551 (Y512 in ITK) in the activation loop of the catalytic domain of BTK to fully
  activate it (Rawlings et al. 1996, Park et al. 1996, Kawakami et al. 1994).
