display_name: Glucosidase II removes glucose residue from Glu1Man9GlucNAc2-CDH1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After MOGS (Glucosidase I) removes the first glucose residue from the core
  glycan, the remaining two glucose residues are removed in a two-step process catalyzed
  by the Glucosidase II complex, which consists of the catalytic subunit GANAB (Glucosidase
  II subunit alpha) and the Glucosidase II subunit beta PRKCSH (reviewed in Helenius
  and Aebi 2004). After the middle glucose residue is removed by Glucosidase II, the
  monoglucosylated (Glu1Man9GlcNAc2) glycoprotein binds to chaperones calnexin (CANX)
  and/or calreticulin (CALR), and is released from the chaperones after the removal
  of the innermost glucose residue by Glucosidase II, which generates a Man9GlcNAc2
  glycan (reviewed in Helenius and Aebi 2004). While the processing of CDH1 by Glucosidase
  II has not been specifically studied, both products expected to be generated by
  Glucosidase II, Glu1Man9GlcNAc2-CDH1 and Man9GlcNAc2-CDH1, are detectable by mass
  spectroscopy (Guo et al. 2017). CDH1 was also shown to bind to CANX, and the binding
  is increased for recombinant CDH1 mutants that cannot undergo wild type glycosylation,
  thus likely being misfolded (Zhou et al. 2008).
