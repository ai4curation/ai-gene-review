display_name: Defective SLC33A1 does not transport Ac-CoA from cytosol to Golgi lumen
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The human gene SLC33A1 encodes acetyl-CoA transporter AT1. SLC33A1 transports
  cytosolic acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) to the Golgi apparatus lumen, where it serves as the
  substrate for acetyltransferases that O-acetylates sialyl residues of gangliosides
  and glycoproteins. Defects in SLC33A1 are the cause of spastic paraplegia autosomal
  dominant type 42 (SPG42; MIM:612539), a neurodegenerative disorder characterised
  by a variable speed of (but progressive) weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs.
  A mutation causing SPG42 is S113R, rendering it non-functional (Lin et al. 2008).
  Defects in SLC33A1 can also cause congenital cataracts, hearing loss, and neurodegeneration
  (CCHLND; MIM:614482), an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by congenital
  cataracts, severe psychomotor retardation, and hearing loss, together with decreased
  serum ceruloplasmin and copper. Mutations in SLC33A1 that can cause CCHLND include
  A110P and Y366* (Huppke et al. 2012).

## Summary

The human gene SLC33A1 encodes acetyl-CoA transporter AT1. SLC33A1 transports cytosolic acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) to the Golgi apparatus lumen, where it serves as the substrate for acetyltransferases that O-acetylates sialyl residues of gangliosides and glycoproteins. Defects in SLC33A1 are the cause of spastic paraplegia autosomal dominant type 42 (SPG42; MIM:612539), a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by a variable speed of (but progressive) weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs. A mutation causing SPG42 is S113R, rendering it non-functional (Lin et al. 2008).
