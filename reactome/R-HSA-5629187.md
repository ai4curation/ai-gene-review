display_name: TP53 binds regulatory elements of SESN1,2,3 genes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'TP53 (p53) binds to the p53 response element in the intron 2 of SESN1 gene
  and stimulates transcription of SESN1 transcripts SESN1-1 and SESN1-3, also known
  as PA26 T2 and PA26 T3 (Velasco-Miguel et al. 1999). Recently, TP53 binding to SESN2
  gene regulatory elements has been identified by ChIPseq (Menendez et al. 2013),
  and SESN2 gene expression was previously shown to be responsive to TP53 (Budanov
  et al. 2002). Rat ortholog of SESN3 was shown to possess p53 binding sites in the
  promoter region, but direct binding of TP53 to regulatory elements of human SESN3
  has not been examined (Brynczka et al. 2007). '
