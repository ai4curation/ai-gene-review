summary: Fibrinogen is a hexameric glycoprotein composed of two α (FGA), two β (FGB),
  and two γ (FGG) polypeptide chains. Fibrinogen subunits are primarily produced and
  assembled in hepatocytes before being secreted into the bloodstream as a complete
  fibrinogen hexamer, which circulates in plasma at high concentrations (2- 4 g/l)
  (Tennent GA et al, 2007; reviewed by Redman CM & Xia H 2001; Lord ST 2007; Kattula
  S et al., 2017; Dobson DA et al., 2024). Fibrinogen subunits are held together by
  disulfide bonds to form an elongated structure with two outer D domains connected
  through a coiled-coil segment to the central E domain. The D domains are made of
  the C-terminal ends of β and γ chains, while the E domain is formed by the N-terminal
  regions of all six chains (Spraggon G et al., 1997; Yang Z et al., 2000; Mosesson
  MW 2005; Kollman JM et al., 2009; Medved L & Weisel JW 2009; Weisel JW & Litvinov
  RI 2017; Butera D & Hogg PJ 2020; Litvinov RI et al., 2021). During coagulation,
  thrombin (FIIa) cleaves the alpha and beta chains of fibrinogen at the E domain.
  This cleavage results in the release of fibrinopeptides A and B from the N-terminal
  regions of the α and β chains, respectively, leading to the formation of a soluble
  fibrin monomer (Ni et al. 1989; Pechik I et al., 2006; Riedel T et al., 2011). The
  cleavage unmasks four binding sites in the E domain allowing binding to the C-terminal
