display_name: Co-stimulation by CD28
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CD28 signaling plays a critical role in shaping immune responses by ensuring
  effective T-cell activation and enhancing T-cell survival and proliferation. When
  CD28 engages its ligands, B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86), on antigen-presenting cells,
  it provides an essential secondary signal that complements T-cell receptor (TCR)
  activation. This costimulatory signal leads to the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2),
  which supports the clonal expansion of T cells, promoting both their proliferation
  and survival by initiating anti-apoptotic pathways (Ribot et al. 2012, Alegre et
  al. 2001). <br><br>The cytoplasmic tail of CD28, upon ligand binding, undergoes
  phosphorylation by Src family kinases like LCK and FYN, triggering downstream signaling
  pathways involving PI3K, VAV-1, Tec family kinases, AKT, and other adaptor proteins
  (Sharpe & Freeman 2002; Chen & Flies 2013).
