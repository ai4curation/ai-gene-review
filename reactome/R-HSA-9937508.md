stable_id: R-HSA-9937508
display_name: TRMT61B methylates adenosine-1472 of MT-CO1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRMT61B methylates the N1 position in adenosine residues of tRNA (Chujo and
  Suzuki 2012) and mRNA (Li et al. 2017). TRMT61B methylates the adenosine-1472 of
  the MT-CO1 mRNA. N1-methyladenosine in mitochondrial mRNA appears to cause ribosome
  stalling that results in reduced translation (Li et al. 2017). TRMT61B forms large
  homooligomeric complexes that are presumed to contain homotetramers (Chujo and Suzuki
  2012, also PDB 2B25).
