stable_id: R-HSA-8954327
display_name: UCKL1 phosphorylates urindine, cytidine
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Based on sequence similarity, cytosolic uridine-cytidine kinase-like 1 (UCKL1
  aka F538) is thought to function as a novel human uridine kinase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase
  (Kashuba et al. 2002). The two human uridine kinases 1 and 2 (UCK1 and UCK2) characterised
  to date phosphorylate uridine/cytidine to uridine monophosphate (UMP)/cytidine monophosphate
  (CMP) using ATP as a phosphate donor (Greenberg et al. 1977, Van Rompay et al. 2001).
