display_name: CAK phosphorylates CDK1 bound to CCNB1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Full activity of most CDKs is dependent on CAK mediated phosphorylation
  at a conserved residue (Thr161 in CDK1, also known as Cdc2). This modification is
  thought to improve substrate binding. Cyclin B:Cdc2 complexes have considerably
  low activity in the absence of CAK mediated phosphorylation (Desai et al 1995).
  CAK is unable to phosphorylate monomeric CDK1 and only phosphorylates it when it
  is bound to cyclin A or cyclin B (Merrick et al. 2008). Using two-dimensional gel
  electrophoresis of protein extracts of cycling human cells, it was shown that in
  CCNB1:CDK1 complexes, the activating T161 phosphorylation never occurs without T14
  phosphorylation, indicating that inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 at T14 by PKMYT1
  precedes the activating phosphorylation at T161 by the CAK complex, thus preventing
  premature CCNB1:CDK1 activation (Coulonval et al. 2011). '

## Summary

Full activity of most CDKs is dependent on CAK mediated phosphorylation at a conserved residue (Thr161 in CDK1, also known as Cdc2). This modification is thought to improve substrate binding. Cyclin B:Cdc2 complexes have considerably low activity in the absence of CAK mediated phosphorylation (Desai et al 1995). CAK is unable to phosphorylate monomeric CDK1 and only phosphorylates it when it is bound to cyclin A or cyclin B (Merrick et al. 2008). Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of protein extracts of cycling human cells, it was shown that in CCNB1:CDK1 complexes, the activating T161 phosphorylation never occurs without T14 phosphorylation, indicating that inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 at T14 by PKMYT1 precedes the activating phosphorylation at T161 by the CAK complex, thus preventing premature CCNB1:CDK1 activation (Coulonval et al. 2011).
