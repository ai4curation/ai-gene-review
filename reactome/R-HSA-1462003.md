stable_id: R-HSA-1462003
display_name: HNP1-4 are stored in primary neutrophil granules
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Alpha defensins HNP1-4, the neutrophil defensins, are stored in biologically
  active form in neutrophil primary (azurophil) granules, where they make up 5-10%
  of total cellular protein in these cells (Lehrere et al. 1993). The relative amounts
  of peptide for HNP-1 to -3 are 2:2:1 with HNP-4 being only a minor component.
