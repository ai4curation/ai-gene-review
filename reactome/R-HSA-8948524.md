display_name: PTENP1 mRNA binds miR-19b RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PTENP1 mRNA is the product of the PTEN pseudogene PTENP1 and is highly homologous
  to PTEN mRNA. PTENP1 mRNA contains a perfect match for the miR-19 family of microRNAs,
  which target PTEN mRNA for degradation. miR-19b was shown to suppress both PTENP1
  and PTEN transcript levels.<br>Overexpression of PTENP1 3'UTR results in de-repression
  of both PTEN mRNA and protein in the presence of mature PTEN-targeting microRNAs.
  Knockdown of PTENP1 decreases abundance of PTEN mRNA and protein. PTENP1 therefore
  functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ce-RNA) in microRNA-mediated PTEN regulation.
  PTENP1 losses have been reported in cancer (Poliseno et al. 2010).
