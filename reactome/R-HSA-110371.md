display_name: LIG1 binds APEX1 and PCNA at SSB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: LIG1 (DNA ligase I) is recruited to the long-patch base excision repair site
  through direct interaction with APEX1 (Ranalli et al. 2002), PCNA (Montecucco et
  al. 1998, Levin et al. 2000) and RFC (Vijayakumar et al. 2009). The binding of LIG1
  to RFC is negatively regulated by LIG1 phosphorylation (Vijaykumar et al. 2009,
  Peng et al. 2012).
