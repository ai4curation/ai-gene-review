stable_id: R-HSA-8949661
display_name: C2orf47:AFG3L2 binds the transit peptide of SMDT1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: C2orf47 exists in a large complex containing AFG3L2 and SPG7, which exist
  in a large complex containing SPG7 (Paraplegin) in the mitochondrial matrix and
  binds the transit peptide of proSMDT1 (proEMRE). The binding stabilizes SMDT1 perhaps
  by preventing backsliding of SMDT1 into the intermembrane space (Konig et al. 2016).
