stable_id: R-HSA-9768643
display_name: miR-10b binds CDH1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A single miR-10b target site was computationally predicted in the CDH1 mRNA
  3′-UTR and its direct targeting was demonstrated by a luciferase assay in which
  a wild-type or a mutant CDH1 mRNA 3'UTR was fused to the luciferase gene (Zhang
  et al. 2015) and a luciferase assay in which a wild-type miR-10b or a mutant miR-10b
  was used (Ma et al. 2017).
