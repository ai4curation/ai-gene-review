summary: The pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) are the most abundant trophoblastic
  proteins in maternal blood during human pregnancy. They are secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast
  and are detected around day 14 post fertilization. The PSG family belongs to the
  carcinoembryonic antigen family. There are ten human protein-coding PSG genes (PSG1-
  PSG9, PSG11) (Thompson et al. 1990). Several studies indicate that PSGs have immunoregulatory,
  proangiogenic, and anti-platelet functions. PSGs (PSG1) binds to cell surface proteoglycans
  that have covalently attached glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically to syndecans
  1-4 and glypican-1, to induce endothelial tube formation (Lisboa et al. 2011). PSG1
  interacts with and activates Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) (Blois et
  al. 2014, Moore & Dveksler 2014). During pregnancy, TGFB1 regulates many processes
  essential for pregnancy success including trophoblast invasion and proliferation,
  angiogenesis, extracellular matrix formation and tolerance to the foetal semi-allograft
  (Jones et al. 2006). TGFB1 also regulates the production of vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) and this may contribute to  PSG1-induced VEGF-A secretion (Ha
  et al. 2010). Therefore the pro-angiogenic properties of some PSGs are mediated
  by two different mechanisms, TGF-beta mediated induction of VEGF-A, and direct interaction
  of PSGs with GAGs on the surface of endothelial cells.
