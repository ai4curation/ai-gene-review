display_name: Ligation of newly synthesized repair patch to incised DNA in TC-NER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The nucleotide excision repair (NER) is completed when the newly synthesized
  fragment is ligated to the incised DNA strand, thus sealing the single stranded
  nick (SSB). Two DNA ligases, LIG1 and LIG3, can perform the ligation in transcription-coupled
  NER (TC-NER), as well as in global genome NER (GG-NER) (Arakawa et al. 2012, Paul-Konietzko
  et al. 2015).
