display_name: NUBPL transfers 4Fe-4S to Complex I subunits
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In total, eight iron-sulfur (4Fe-4S) clusters are incorporated into six subunits
  (mitochondrial matrix-located NDUFS1, S2, S7, S8 and mitochondrial membrane-located
  V1 and V2) (Andrews et al. 2013). Incorporation into NDUFV1 and V2 (located on the
  mitochondrial membrane) is shown in a separate reaction. The process requires the
  presence of the co-chaperone complex HSPA9:HSCB (Maio et al., 2017). The mechanism
  of transfer in all cases is unknown.
