stable_id: R-HSA-9865196
display_name: p-Y393-ABL1 phosphorylates tyrosine-407 of YAP1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: During turbulent flow across endothelial cells, ABL1 is activated by phosphorylation
  of tyrosine-393 (tyrosine-412 of isoform 2) and then phosphorylates YAP1 on tyrosine-407
  (Levy et al. 2008, Li et al. 2019). Phosphorylation of YAP1 requires engagement
  of integrin alpha5 (ITGA5) with fibronectin (Li et al. 2019).
