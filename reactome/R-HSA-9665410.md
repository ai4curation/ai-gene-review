display_name: Phosphorylated heterodimers of ERBB2 ECD mutants and EGFR bind PLCG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PLCgamma1 signaling is activated dowsntream of ERBB2 ECD mutants ERBB2 G309A
  (Bose et al. 2013), ERBB2 G309E (Greulich et al. 2012) and ERBB2 S310F (Greulich
  et al. 2012), as evidenced by activating phosphorylation of PLCG1. It is assumed
  that heterodimers of ERBB2 ECD mutants and EGFR, like the wild type heterodimers
  of ERBB2 and EGFR, bind to PLCG1.
