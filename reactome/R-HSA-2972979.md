stable_id: R-HSA-2972979
display_name: POU5F1 (OCT4), NANOG bind the CDX2 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The CDX2 gene is bound by POU5F1 (OCT4) (Boyer et al. 2005, Lister et al.
  2009), SOX2 (Lister et al. 2009) and NANOG ( Boyer et al. 2005, Lister et al. 2009)
  and POU5F1 repress expression of CDX2 (Babaie et al. 2007). CDX2 and T (Brachyury)
  mediate the differentiation of stem cells induced by BMP (Bernardo et al. 2011).
