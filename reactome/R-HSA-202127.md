species: Homo sapiens
summary: Nitric oxide (NO) is produced from L-arginine by the family of nitric oxide
  synthases (NOS) enzymes, forming the free radical NO and citrulline as byproduct
  (Janssens et al. 1992). The cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential requirement
  for the delivery of an electron to the intermediate in the catalytic cycle of NOS.
