stable_id: R-HSA-877269
display_name: SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 binds to p-JAK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 coprecipitates with JAK kinases upon IFNG stimulation and
  are able to inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway, although with different affinity and kinetics.
  SOCS1 and SOCS3 binds to phosphorylated JAK1/2 and prevent the tyrosine kinase activity
  of JAKs through their kinase inhibitory region (KIR), thereby inhibiting downstream
  IFNG signaling. SOCS1 may also prevent IFNG signaling by targeting the signaling
  machinery to ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway.
