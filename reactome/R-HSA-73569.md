summary: Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate to
  orotate (orotic acid).  The enzyme is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane
  oriented so that cytosolic dihydroorotate molecules have access to it, and orotate
  is released into the cytosol. The reducing equivalents generated by the reaction
  are transferred by ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q) to the electron transport chain within
  the inner mitochondrial membrane. There is no evidence for the involvement of NAD+
  as an acceptor of reducing equivalents in this reaction in mammalian cells (Jones
  1980). In contrast, the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme isolated from the anaerobic
  bacterium Clostridium oroticum requires NAD+ as a cofactor but also proceeds strongly
  in the direction of dihydroorotate synthesis consistent with the greater electronegativity
  of NAD+ (Lieberman and Kornberg 1953).<P>Early studies of purified rat liver enzyme
  by Forman and Kennedy suggested the presence of flavin mononucleotide and iron-sulfur
  complexes as cofactors. More recent work by Bader, Beuneu, and their colleagues
  with recombinant human protein expressed in insect cells has confirmed the presence
  of flavin mononucleotide, at a stoichiometry of one molecule per molecule of apoenzyme
  but suggests that iron-sulfur complexes, if indeed they are involved in the oxidation
  and electron transport process, are not an integral part of the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
  holoenzyme.
