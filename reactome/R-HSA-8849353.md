stable_id: R-HSA-8849353
display_name: Dynein drives COPI-independent retrograde traffic from the Golgi to
  the ER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The RAB6 pathway moves select retrograde cargo from the Golgi to the ER in
  a motor-dependent manner, although the precise details of this translocation remain
  to be worked out (Girod et al, 1999; White et al, 1999; reviewed in Heffernan and
  Simpson, 2014). Active RAB18 at the ER membrane may contribute to targeting and
  fusion of COPI-independent retrograde carriers through interaction with ER-localized
  tethering factors (Dejgaard et al, 2008; Gerondopoulos et al, 2014; Gillingham et
  al, 2014)
