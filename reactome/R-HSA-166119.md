display_name: First phosphorylation of IRAK1 by IRAK4 bound to activated TLR:MyD88:Mal
species: Homo sapiens
summary: First, IRAK1 is phosphorylated at Thr209 by IRAK4. This results in a conformational
  change of the kinase domain, permitting further phosphorylations to take place.
  Substitution of Thr209 by alanine results in a kinase-inactive IRAK1.
