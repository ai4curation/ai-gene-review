display_name: TFIIH binds GG-NER site to form a verification complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Transcription factor II H (TFIIH) complex is recruited to DNA damage sites
  after the damage is recognized by the XPC:RAD23:CETN2 complex and the UV-DDB complex
  (DDB1:DDB2) (Volker et al. 2001, Araujo and Wood 1999).<p>TFIIH consists of ten
  subunits organized into a ring-like structure (Schultz et al. 2000). The TFIIH core,
  also forming a ring-like structure, includes a DNA helicase ERCC3 (XPB), GTF2H1
  (BTF2-p62), GTF2H2 (BTF2-p44), GTF2H3 (BTF2-p34) and GTF2H4 (BTF2-p52). GTF2H4 directly
  interacts with ERCC3 and anchors it to the TFIIH complex (Jawhari et al. 2002).
  Another DNA helicase, ERCC2 (XPD) is anchored to the TFIIH complex by binding to
  the GTF2H2 subunit (Coin et al. 1998). The CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex,
  consisting of CCNH (cyclin H), CDK7 and MNAT1 (MAT1) is included in the TFIIH complex
  through an interaction with ERCC2 (Reardon et al. 1996, Rossignol et al. 1997).
  The tenth subunit, GTF2H5 (TTDA, TFB5, BTF2-p5) is important for the stability of
  the TFIIH complex (Giglia-Mari et al. 2004). The TFIIH complex binds the DNA damage
  site after XPC:RAD23:CETN2 complex recognizes the damage (Volker et al. 2001, Riedl
  et al. 2003), and the ERCC3 and GTF2H1 subunits of TFIIH directly interact with
  XPC (Yokoi et al. 2003).
