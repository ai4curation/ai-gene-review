display_name: Proteasomal cleavage of substrate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The 26S proteasome complex consists of the 20S catalytic core particle which
  harbours the proteolytically active sites and the regulatory 19S particle which
  is responsible for substrate interaction. The 26S proteasomal cleavage generates
  a vast number (perhaps hundreds) of different peptides, depending on the length
  and sequence of the substrate protein. Only a small fraction of these peptides (nearly
  10%) form the exact length to be presented by class I MHC; most (approximately 70%)
  are too short to bind. The remaining proteasome products (10-20%) are N-terminally
  extended precursors that require additional cleavage by cytosolic aminopeptidases
  for presentation by MHC class I molecules.
