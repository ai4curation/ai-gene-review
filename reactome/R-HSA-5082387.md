display_name: Phosphorylation of HSF1 at Ser230 induces transactivation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The transcriptional activity of HSF1 has been shown to be controlled by the
  regulatory domain composed of amino acids 221-310 (Green M et al. 1995; Zuo J et
  al. 1995; Newton EM et al., 1996). Ser230 is located in this regulatory domain of
  HSF1 and is constitutively and stress-inducibly phosphorylated (Holmberg CI et al.
  2001). Analyses with phosphopeptide-specific antibody  and site-directed mutagenesis
  revealed that phosphorylation at Ser230 enhanced the inducible HSF1 transcriptional
  activity in heat-shocked human K562 erythroleukemia and HeLa cells (Holmberg CI
  et al 2001). Active calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was
  shown to phosphorylate HSF1 at Ser230 in vitro. Moreover, CaMKII enhanced heat-induced
  tranactivating capacity of HSF1 and the level of endogenous Ser230 phosphorylation
  in K562 cells transfected with active CaMKII together with a CAT reporter plasmid
  containing the proximal HSE of human hsp70 promoter. Thus, CaMKII signaling may
  be involved in the positive regulation of HSF1-mediated transactivation. However,
  the possibility that other protein kinases might also phosphorylate Ser230 in vivo
  should not be excluded (Holmberg CI et al 2001).
