display_name: Formation of CSL-NICD coactivator complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Mammalian CSL Coactivator Complexes: Upon activation of Notch signaling,
  cleavage of the transmembrane Notch receptor releases the Notch Intracellular Domain
  (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to CSL and displaces the
  corepressor complex from CSL (reviewed in Mumm, 2000 and Kovall, 2007). The resulting
  CSL-NICD "binary complex" then recruits an additional coactivator, Mastermind (Mam),
  to form a ternary complex. The ternary complex then recruits additional, more general
  coactivators, such as CREB Binding Protein (CBP), or the related p300 coactivator,
  and a number of Histone Acetytransferase (HAT) proteins, including GCN5 and PCAF
  (Fryer, 2002). There is evidence that Mam also can subsequently recruit specific
  kinases that phosphorylate NICD, to downregulate its function and turn off Notch
  signaling (Fryer, 2004).'
