display_name: BPGM dimer isomerises 1,3BPG to 2,3BPG
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) is an erythrocyte-specific trifunctional
  enzyme. One of its functions is the isomerisation of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPG)  to
  2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3BPG) (Rose 1968). In red blood cells, 2,3BPG is the
  main allosteric effector of hemoglobin, binding preferentially to the deoxygenated
  hemoglobin tetramer, thus reducing oxygen affinity (Arnone 1972).
