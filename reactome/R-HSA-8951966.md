summary: 'EP300 (p300) histone acetyltransferase acetylates RUNX3 on lysine residues
  K94 and K171 (Lee et al. 2013), and probably other lysines (Jin et al. 2004). EP300-mediated
  acetylation of RUNX3 is positively regulated by TGF-beta treatment. Besides increasing
  the transcriptional activity of RUNX3, EP300-mediated acetylation also increases
  the half-life of RUNX3, as it interferes with SMURF-mediated ubiquitination and
  subsequent degradation of RUNX3 (Jin et al. 2004). '

## Summary

EP300 (p300) histone acetyltransferase acetylates RUNX3 on lysine residues K94 and K171 (Lee et al. 2013), and probably other lysines (Jin et al. 2004). EP300-mediated acetylation of RUNX3 is positively regulated by TGF-beta treatment. Besides increasing the transcriptional activity of RUNX3, EP300-mediated acetylation also increases the half-life of RUNX3, as it interferes with SMURF-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of RUNX3 (Jin et al. 2004).
