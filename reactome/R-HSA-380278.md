display_name: CCNB1:p-T160-CDK1 phosphorylates NUMA1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After the initiation of DNA condensation in prophase of mitosis, NuMA (NUMA1)
  is phosphorylated on threonine residue 2055 by the complex of Cdc2 (CDK1) kinase
  and Cyclin B1 (CCNB1). After the nuclear envelope breakdown, phosphorylated NuMA
  rapidly moves to the centrosomal region (Compton and Luo 1995, Hsu and Yeh 1996,
  Kotak et al. 2013). Another phosphorylation event  occurs when NuMA associates with
  the mitotic spindle (Gaglio et al. 1995; Hsu and Yeh 1996).  While CCNB1:p-T160-CDK1-dependent
  phosphorylation appears to plays an essential role in the targeting of NuMA to the
  spindle apparatus (Compton and Luo 1995, Hsu and Yeh 1996, Kotak et al. 2013), there
  may be additional protein kinases that promote the release of NuMA from the nuclear
  compartment at nuclear envelope breakdown (Saredi et al. 1997).
