display_name: ATF4 and phospho-ATF2 bind the DDIT3 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The promoter of the DDIT3 (CHOP) gene contains an Amino Acid Response Element
  (AARE) that binds ATF4 and ATF2. ATF2 and ATF4 are required for full activation
  of gene transcription in response to amino acid deprivation (Bruhat et al. 2000,
  Averous et al. 2004). Phospho-ATF2 is essential in the acetylation of histone H4
  and H2B (Bruhat et al. 2007). ATF4 recruits PCAF to enhance transcription (Chérasse
  et al. 2007). ATF4 appears to be a monomer in the absence of DNA and a dimer after
  binding DNA (Podust et al. 2001).
