display_name: TYK2-dependent STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT1 and STAT3 are phosphorylated in ALK+ and ALK- ALCL in a manner that
  depends on active TYK2. Knockout or inhibition of TYK2 in ALCL human and mouse models
  abrogates STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation, decreases expression of MCL1 and increases
  cell death, implicating a TYK2-STAT-MCL signaling cascade in ALCL cell survival
  (Prutsch et al, 2019). Direct phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 by TYK2 has not
  been demonstrated, nor has direct binding of either STAT to the promoter of the
  MCL1 gene, despite previous evidence supporting a JAK/STAT/MCL1 pathway (Prutsch
  et al, 2019; Rassidakis et al, 2002). Moreover, although autocrine stimulation of
  IL10 and IL22 has been implicated in the activation of TYK2 in these cells, the
  precise mechanism for TYK2 upregulation in ALCLs has not been determined (Prutsch
  et al, 2019).<br>STAT3 is a known effector of NPM1-ALK-mediated signaling, but the
  role of STAT1 is somewhat less clear (Crescenzo et al, 2015; Chiarle et al, 2005;
  reviewed in Chiarle, 2008). STAT1 has been described as a tumor suppressor in ALCL,
  and one study showed that STAT1 is downregulated in ALCL in an NPM1-ALK- and proteasome-dependent
  fashion (Wu et al, 2015; Avalle et al, 2012; Zhang and Liu, 2017).
