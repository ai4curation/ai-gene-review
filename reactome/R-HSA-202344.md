display_name: Recruitment of ZAP-70 to phosphorylated ITAMs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Phosphorylation of the ITAMs by Lck is followed by the recruitment of the
  ZAP-70 a member of Syk family PTK, to the receptor complex. ZAP-70 is exclusively
  expressed in T cells and NK cells. The dually phosphorylated ITAMs provide a high-affinity
  docking site for the tandem SH2-domains of the ZAP-70. Once recruited, ZAP-70 is
  activated by phosphorylation and will be responsible for the phosphorylation of
  further downstream molecules. Due to the presence of 10 ITAMs in the TCR complex,
  up to 10 ZAP-70 molecules may cluster on the fully phosphorylated receptors. '
