display_name: CD19 Signalosome phosphorylates PI(4,5)P2 forming PI(3,4,5)P3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PI3K generates phosphoinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) from PIP2 after
  activation of the BCR (Gold et al. 1992). Experiments in mice indicate that PI3K
  associated with CD19 is partly responsible for the activity (Buhl et al. 1997, Otero
  et al. 2001, Aiba et al. 2008). (PI3K associated with BCAP is also partly responsible
  (Aiba et al. 2008).)
