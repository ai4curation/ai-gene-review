stable_id: R-HSA-9825772
display_name: SIRT1 deacetylates HINT1 dimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HINT1 is a transcriptional repressor protein with tumor suppressive activity
  that exerts its influence by binding to transcription factors like MITF and CTNNB1
  (Lee et al, 2004; Razin et al, 1999; Weiske et al, 2005; Genovese et al, 2009).
  The ability of HINT1 to bind to MITF and CTNNB1 is modulated by its acetylation
  state at lysine residues K21 and K30 (Choudhary et al, 2009; Motzik et al, 2017).
  Deacetylation at these sites by SIRT1 promotes the interaction between MITF and
  HINT1 and consequently restricts the transcription of MITF-dependent target genes
  (Jung et al, 2020).
