display_name: Insulin binds the insulin receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Under normal physiological conditions blood glucose levels are kept under
  tight control by a series of regulated steps that ensure glucose homeostasis. Upon
  feeding glucose levels rise and in response to this the body secretes insulin from
  pancreatic beta-cells into the blood. At physiological concentrations insulin is
  present in the blood in its monomeric form. The insulin receptor is a tetramer,
  consisting of two alpha and two beta chains, which are produced by cleavage of a
  single translated peptide chain (Schenker & Kohanski 1991).  Binding of insulin
  to its receptor occurs on the receptor alpha-subunits. There are two binding domains
  involved on the receptor (L1 and L2) and it is thought that the amino-terminus of
  insulin binds with L1 on one of the alpha-subunits and the carboxyterminus with
  L2 on the other alpha-subunit.<p>The binding of insulin to its receptor causes a
  conformational change in the alpha-subunits. This in turn produces a conformational
  change in the beta-subunits leading to the activation of the intrinsic insulin receptor
  tyrosine kinase.
