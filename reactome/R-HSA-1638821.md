display_name: PP2A-B56 dephosphorylates centromeric cohesin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of the STAG2 subunit of centromeric cohesin
  (Hauf et al. 2005) is counteracted by the kinetochore PP2A phosphatase, containing
  the 56 kDa regulatory B subunit (PP2A-B56 i.e. PP2A-PPP2R5). PP2A-B56 is recruited
  to the centromeric cohesin complex by shugoshin proteins (SGOL1 and SGOL2) (Kitajima
  et al. 2006), which are also kinetochore constituents (Cheeseman and Desai 2008).
  SGOL1 localization to centromeres is sustained by the interaction with histone H2A
  possessing the phosphorylation of T120 which is introduced by the protein kinase
  BUB1, and heterochromatin protein HP1 (Kitajima et al. 2005, Kawashima et al. 2010,
  Yamagishi et al. 2008). Shugoshin- and PP2A-B56-regulated dephosphorylation of centromeric
  STAG2 ensures that the cohesin complex remains bound to centromeres throughout prometaphase
  and metaphase, thereby preventing premature separation of sister chromatids (Salic
  et al. 2004, Kitajima et al. 2004, Kitajima et al. 2005, Kitajima et al. 2006).
