display_name: CBCAP complex binds 7-methylguanosine cap of snRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: As the capped pre-snRNA continues to be elongated, the CBCAP complex comprising
  NCBP1 (CBP80), NCBP2 (CBP20), SRRT (ARS2) and PHAX binds the 7-methylguanosine cap
  (Hallais et al. 2013). The CBCAP complex enhances 3' processing of the pre-snRNA
  (Hallais et al. 2013) and participates in export of the snRNA from the nucleus to
  the cytosol, where the snRNA is further modified and assembled with proteins into
  pre-snRNPs.
