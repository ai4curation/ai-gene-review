display_name: VHL:EloB,C:NEDD8-CUL2:RBX1 complex ubiquitinylates HIF-alpha
species: Homo sapiens
summary: VHL is the substrate binding protein of a CUL2-based E3 ubiquitin ligase
  complex that conjugates ubiquitin to hydroxylated HIF-alpha (Iwai et al. 1999, Kamura
  et al. 2000, Ohh et al. 2000, Groulx and Lee 2002, Maynard et al. 2003). VHL is
  predominantly cytosolic and shuttles between the cytosol and the nucleus (Lee et
  al. 1999, Groulx and Lee 2002). Ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-alpha can
  occur in both the cytosol and the nucleus (Berra et al. 2001). Upon return to normoxia
  from hypoxia most ubiquitinated HIF-alpha is nuclear (Groulx and Lee 2002).
