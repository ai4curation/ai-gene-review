stable_id: R-HSA-9860139
display_name: MIR27B microRNA binds 3'UTR of TGFBR3 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Dual luciferase assay indicates that miR‐27b‐3p significantly reduced the
  luciferase activity by binding to the site of 1525‐1531 of TGFBR3 3ʹ‐UTR suggesting
  that TGFBR3 is a target of  miR‐27b‐3p (Yang et al, 2019)
