stable_id: R-HSA-5229111
display_name: AP4 transports APP from trans-Golgi network to endosome lumen
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AP-4 complex subunit mu-1 (AP4M1) can recognise and interact with tyrosine-based
  (YXXphi) sorting signals found within the cytoplasmic tails of integral membrane
  proteins such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP), implicated in Alzheimer's
  disease. Once bound to AP4M1, APP is transported from the trans-Golgi network (TGN)
  to endosomes, thereby reducing amyloidogenic processing of the protein. Disruption
  of this interaction decreases localisation of APP to endosomes and enhances gamma-secretase-catalysed
  cleavage of APP to the pathogenic amyloid-beta peptide (Burgos et al. 2010).
