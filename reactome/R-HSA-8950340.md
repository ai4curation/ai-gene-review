display_name: IL27RA and IL6ST are phosphorylated after IL27:IL27 receptor interaction
  and JAK's phosphorylation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-27 receptor is formed by Interleukin-27 receptor subunit alpha
  (IL27RA, WSX-1) and Interleukin-27 receptor subunit beta (IL6ST, gp130). Both subunits
  can be tyrosine phosphorylated after ligand-receptor interaction (Pflanz et al.
  2004, Takeda et al. 2003). There is general agreement that ligand binding to cytokine
  receptors results in the activation of prebound Jak kinases, which auto- and transphosphorylate
  then phosphorylate key tyrosine residues on the receptor (O'Shea et al 2002), but
  for the interleukin-27 receptor the pattern of phosphorylations is not clear, hence
  this is represented as a black box event.
