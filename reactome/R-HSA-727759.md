stable_id: R-HSA-727759
display_name: SLC33A1 transports Ac-CoA from cytosol to Golgi lumen
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The human gene SLC33A1 encodes acetyl-CoA transporter AT1 (Kanamori et al.
  1997). Acetyl-CoA is transported to the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, where it serves
  as the substrate of acetyltransferases that O-acetylates sialyl residues of gangliosides
  and glycoproteins. Defects in SLC33A1 are the cause of spastic paraplegia autosomal
  dominant type 42 (SPG42) which is a neurodegenerative disorder (Lin et al. 2008).
