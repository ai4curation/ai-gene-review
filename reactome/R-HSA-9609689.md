stable_id: R-HSA-9609689
display_name: HCMV Binds to the Host Cell via heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Viral attachment and penetration of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) occurs either
  via direct HCMV fusion with the cell membrane or via endocytosis. The endocytic
  mechanism occurs with  cell types including endothelial and epithelial cells, where
  the pentameric viral protein complex, gH:gL:p128:p130:p131A, facilitates entry.
