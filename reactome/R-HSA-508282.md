stable_id: R-HSA-508282
display_name: SYK is a substrate for JAK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Studies have shown that coexpression of Syk with catalytically active Jak1
  results in Syk phosphorylation whereas coexpression of Syk with catalytically active
  Jak3 does not, suggesting that IL-2 driven phosphorylation of Syk is driven by Jak1
  (Zhou et al. 2000).
