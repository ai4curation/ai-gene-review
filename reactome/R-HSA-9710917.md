stable_id: R-HSA-9710917
display_name: ALK fusion proteins bind PLCG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Based on studies with the oncogenic NPM-ALK fusion, oncogenic ALK fusions
  are believed to signal through the PLC gamma signaling pathway. PLCG1 binds to phosphorylated
  tyrosine 1604 on the activated receptor. PLCG1 signaling contributes to mitogenesis
  and cellular proliferation downstream of ALK signaling (Bai et al, 1998; Hernandez
  et al, 2002; reviewed in Chiarle et al, 2008; Hallberg and Palmer, 2013; Roskoski,
  2013; Ducray et al, 2019).
