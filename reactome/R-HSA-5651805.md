display_name: LIG1 bound to APEX1 and PCNA ligates SSB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: LIG1 (DNA ligase 1) is recruited to the long-patch base excision repair site
  through its interaction with APEX1, PCNA and RFC. LIG1 ligates the 3' end of the
  single strand break (SSB), containing the newly synthesized multiple nucleotide
  repair patch, with the FEN1-processed 5' end of the SSB, thus completing the base
  excision repair (Klungland and Lindahl 1997, Tomkinson et al. 2001, Ranalli et al.
  2002a). The catalytic activity of LIG1 is stimulated by the presence of PCNA-bound
  RPA (Ranalli et al. 2002b)
