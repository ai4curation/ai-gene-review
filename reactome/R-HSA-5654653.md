display_name: Activated FGFR4 phosphorylates FRS3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FRS3 (also known as FRS2 beta) is activated through tyrosine phosphorylation
  catalyzed by the protein kinase domain of the activated FGFR.  By sequence comparison,
  FRS3 has the 2 PPTN11/SHP2-binding sites and has three of the four GRB2-binding
  sites.
