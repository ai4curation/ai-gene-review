species: Homo sapiens
summary: Extracellular- , juxtamembrane- and kinase-domain mutants of KIT have been
  shown to activate the  STAT pathway, as assessed by STAT phosphorylation.  The biological
  relevance of each STAT isoform varies between tumor types (Brizzi et al, 1999; Ning
  et al, 2001; Frost et al, 2002; Growney et al, 2005; Hara et al, 2017; Obata et
