summary: 'Activated MAP2K phosphorylates MAPK on threonine and tyrosine residues in
  the activation loop (residues T202 and Y204 in MAPK3, residues T185 and Y187 in
  MAPK1) (Ray et al, 1988; reviewed in Roskoski, 2012b). MAPK3 and MAPK1 are 84% identical
  and appear to be stimulated in parallel by all known activators of the MAPK pathway
