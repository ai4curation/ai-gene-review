stable_id: R-HSA-5655245
display_name: Activated FGFR2 mutants:p-FRS2:GRB2:GAB1:PIK3R1 binds PIK3CA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activation of the PI3K pathway has been demonstrated downstream of a number
  of FGFR mutants (reviewed in Wesche, 2001; see for instance, Agazie, 2003; Kunii,
  2008; Takeda, 2007; Chen, 2004; Demiroglu, 2001; Guasch, 2001; Byron, 2008), and
  is presumed to occur in a manner analogous to the wild-type receptor.
