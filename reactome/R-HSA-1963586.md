stable_id: R-HSA-1963586
display_name: SRC family kinases phosphorylate ERBB2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Dissociation of HSP90 from ERBB2 upon formation of ERBB2 heterodimers (with
  either EGFR, ERBB3 or ERBB4) enables phosphorylation of ERBB2 on the tyrosine residue
  Y877, mediated by one of SRC family kinases  - SRC, FYN or YES1. Although not a
  mandatory prerequisite of ERBB2 catalytic activity, the phosphorylation at Y877
  significantly increases the kinase activity of ERBB2.
