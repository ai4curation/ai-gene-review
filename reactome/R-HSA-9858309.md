display_name: miR-211 RISC binds POU3F2 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: miR-211 is an MITF-M-dependent target gene that is expressed in the melanocyte
  lineage and is frequently downregulated in melanoma (Hunter et al, 1998; Duncan
  et al, 1998; Duncan et al, 2001). miR-211 has been proposed as a regulator of melanoma
  cell invasivess through regulation of some of its target genes (Margue et al, 2013;
  De Luca et al, 2016; Levy et al, 2010).<br>miR-211 binds to cognate sites in the
  3'UTR of the POU3F2 transcript to repress translation (Boyle et al, 2011). Because
  POU3F2 is itself a regulator of MITF, miR-211 establishes a feedback loop linking
  between POU3F2 and MITF expression levels (Goodall et al, 2008; Wellbrook et al,
  2008; Herbert et al, 2019; reviewed in Goding and Arnheiter, 2019; Fane et al, 2019).
