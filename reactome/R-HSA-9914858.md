display_name: RNASEH1 cleaves RNA primer from nascent H strand, leaving RNA dinucleotides
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RNASEH1, an RNA endonuclease specific for the RNA component of RNA-DNA heteroduplexes
  (Wu et al. 1999), cleaves most of the RNA primer from the 5' end of the newly synthesized
  H strand (Ruhanen et al. 2011), leaving about 2 ribonucleotides (Lima et al. 2007).
  RNASEH1 is able to cleave RNA in RNA-DNA heteroduplexes when the RNA is not part
  of a flap structure (Karlowicz et al. 2022). Absence of RNASEH1 in mouse fibroblasts
  causes retention of RNA primers in the OriH region of the replicated H strand and
  in the OriL region of the replicated L strand (Holmes et al. 2015), confirming the
  participation of RNASEH1 in primer removal. Specific mutations in RNASEH1 in humans
  cause impaired mitochondrial DNA replication with evidence of retained primer RNA
  at OriH (Reyes et al. 2015).
