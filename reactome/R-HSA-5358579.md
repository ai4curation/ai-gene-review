display_name: DNA polymerase delta polymerizes DNA across single stranded gap
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DNA polymerase delta synthesizes DNA across a single-stranded gap during
  mismatch repair (Longley et al. 1997, Zhang et al. 2005, Constantin et al. 2005,
  reviewed in Prindle and Loeb 2012). RPA stimulates the activity of DNA polymerase
  delta (Dong et al. 1999). DNA polymerase delta does not displace strands during
  synthesis (Randahl et al. 1988).
