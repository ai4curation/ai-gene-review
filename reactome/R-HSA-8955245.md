display_name: CAND1 binds CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase in the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CRL complexes consist of a cullin protein (CUL1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 5, 7 and 9
  in humans) and a RING box protein (RBX1 or 2) in addition to one or more substrate
  binding proteins that confer substrate specificity to the complex (reviewed in Petroski
  and Deshaies, 2005; Lipkowitz and Weismann, 2011). CRL4 complexes contain CUL4A
  or CUL4B. Cullin-associated NEDD8-dissociated protein 1 (CAND1, TIP120) is a key
  assembly factor of Cullin E3 RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes, acting as a
  substrate receptor exchange factor. CAND1 binds to the inactive, deneddylated CRL
  complex through the conserved amino-terminal 3 Cullin repeats of the cullin subunit,
  which are also required for binding of the substrate binding proteins (Zheng et
  al, 2002a, b; Liu et al 2002; Min et al, 2003; Goldenberg et al, 2004). In this
  way, CAND1 binding destabilizes the CRL complex, allowing exchange of the substrate
  binding protein (Schmidt et al, 2009; Pierce et al, 2013). Neddylation of the CRL
  complex results in a conformational change that eliminates the CAND1 binding site
  (Duda et al, 2008; Saha and Deshaies, 2008; Boh et al, 2011).
