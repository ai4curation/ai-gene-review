stable_id: R-HSA-5252133
display_name: ATP6AP1 binds V-ATPase
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Vacuolar-type H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) are proton pumps that acidify intracellular
  cargos and deliver protons across the plasma membrane of many specialised cells.
  V-type proton ATPase subunit S1 (ATP6AP1) is thought to function as an accessory
  subunit of the V0 subcomplex of V-ATPase, facilitating acidification (Supek et al.
  1994). Experiments with the mouse orthologue reveals a role for Atp6ap1 in osteoclast
  formation and function (Qin et al. 2011).
