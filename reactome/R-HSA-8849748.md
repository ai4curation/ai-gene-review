display_name: The COG complex binds RABs at the Golgi membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Large scale screens have identified numerous RAB proteins that interact with
  components of the COG complex (Fukuda et al, 2008; Miller et al, 2013; reviewed
  in Willet et al, 2013).  Although RAB proteins are known to play key roles in trafficking
  and Golgi structure and function, the significance of some of these interactions
  is not yet clear (Kelly et al, 2012; Liu et al, 2013; reviewed in Liu and Storrie,
  2015).
