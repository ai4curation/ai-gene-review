stable_id: R-HSA-9935282
display_name: NEXT:ZC3H4:CBCA:m7GpppN-RNA binds the RNA exosome
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The EXOSC10 (RRP6, PM/Scl-100) subunit of the RNA exosome interacts with
  the MTREX (MTR4, SKIV2L2) subunit of the NEXT complex (Schilders et al. 2007). The
  NEXT complex interacts with both ZC3H4 and the RNA exosome (Rouvière et al. 2023,
  Estell et al. 2023). The interaction of the RNA exosome with the MTREX subunit of
  the NEXT complex is stoichiometric, however, interaction with other subunits of
  the NEXT complex is substoichiometric (Andersen et al. 2013).
