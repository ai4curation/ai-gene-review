display_name: Translocation of nuclear RNA transport complex to cytoplasm
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Crm1 is a nucleocytoplasmic transport factor that is believed to interact
  with nucleoporins facilitating docking of the  RRE-Rev-CRM1-RanGTP complex to the
  nuclear pore and the translocation of the complex across the nuclear pore complex
  (see Cullen 1998) Crm1 has been found in complex with two such nucleoporins, CAN/Nup214
  and Nup88 which have been shown to be components of the human nuclear pore complex
  (Fornerod et al., 1997). '
