display_name: CUL5 mediates ubiquitination of ERBB2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-5 (CUL5) is recruited to the ERBB2 site at the
  plasma membrane and ubiquitinates ERBB2 in an HSP90-dependent way, targeting it
  for degradation. Ubiquitination of ERBB2 by CUL5 appears to be independent of CUL5
  adaptor proteins ElonginB and ElonginC.
