display_name: YWHAB (14-3-3 beta/alpha) dimer binds phosphorylated YAP1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: YWHAB (14-3-3 beta/alpha) binds phosphorylated YAP1 proteins, sequestering
  them in the cytosol. Structural studies indicate that the active form of YWHAB (14-3-3
  beta/alpha) is a homodimer (Yang et al. 2006); the stoichiometry of its complex
  with YAP1 is unknown and has been annotated arbitrarily here to involve one YAP1
  molecule and a YWHAB (14-3-3 beta/alpha) dimer. While YAP1 can be phosphorylated
  on several serine residues, phosphorylation of serine-127 appears to be critical
  for YWHAB(14-3-3 beta/alpha)  binding (Zhao et al. 2007).
