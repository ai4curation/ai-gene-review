stable_id: R-HSA-5654714
display_name: FGFR4- and PTPN11-associated PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once recruited to the activated receptor, PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3,
  leading to activation of AKT signaling.  PI3K signaling has been demonstrated in
  ZMYM2-, FOP- and BCR-FGFR1 fusions (Chen, 2004; Demiroglu, 2001; Guasch, 2001),
  as well as downstream of a number of other FGFR mutants (see for instance, Byron,
  2008; Kunii, 2008; Agazie, 2003; Takeda, 2007).
