display_name: Phosphorylation of ABL1 on tyrosine-393 in response to oscillatory shear
  stress
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Through an uncharacterized mechanism, oscillatory shear stress and the binding
  of integrin apha5:integrin beta1 (ITGA5:ITGB1) to fibronectin matrix cause ABL to
  be phosphorylated on tyrosine-393 of the reference isoform, which corresponds to
  tyrosine-412 of isoform 2 (Li et al. 2019).

## Summary

Through an uncharacterized mechanism, oscillatory shear stress and the binding of integrin apha5:integrin beta1 (ITGA5:ITGB1) to fibronectin matrix cause ABL to be phosphorylated on tyrosine-393 of the reference isoform, which corresponds to tyrosine-412 of isoform 2 (Li et al. 2019).
