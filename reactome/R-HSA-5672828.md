stable_id: R-HSA-5672828
display_name: mTORC1 phosphorylates AKT1S1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AKT1S1 (PRAS40) is phosphorylated by AKT at Thr246, which leads to the binding
  of YWHAB (14-3-3 beta) (Zhang et al. 2002, Kovacina et al. 2003. AKT1S1 is phosphorylated
  at Ser183 by mTORC1 (Oshiro et al. 2007); mutation of Ser183 decreases the affinity
  of AKT1S1 with YWHAB. As AKT1S1 suppresses mTORC1 phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1
  (Oshiro et al. 2007), binding of YWHAB is proposed to relieve this inhibition (Wang
  et al. 2012).
