stable_id: R-HSA-182795
display_name: RNase H-mediated degradation of the template strand
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The rate of RNase H cleavage is substantially lower than the rate of DNA
  synthesis (Kati et al. 1992), so the product of the combined DNA synthesis and RNA
  degradation events catalyzed by the RT heterodimer mediating minus-strand DNA synthesis
  is a DNA segment still duplexed with extended viral genomic RNA fragments. Other
  RT heterodimers bind the remaining RNA:DNA heteroduplexes and their RNase H domains
  further degrade the viral genomic RNA (Wisniewski et al. 2000a, b). Two PPT (polypurine
  tract) sequence motifs in the template, one immediately 5' to the U3 sequence and
  one located within the pol gene in the center of the viral genome, are spared from
  degradation (Charneau et al. 1992; Julias et al. 2004; Pullen et al. 1993).
