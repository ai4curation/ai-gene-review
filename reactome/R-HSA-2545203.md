summary: 'Histone deacetylase HDAC8 deacetylates SMC3 cohesin subunit. SMC3 deacetylation
  promotes dissociation of cleaved RAD21 fragments from other cohesin proteins and

  SMC1A and SMC3, can cause Cornelia de Lang syndrome (Deardorff et al. 2012).  '

## Summary

Histone deacetylase HDAC8 deacetylates SMC3 cohesin subunit. SMC3 deacetylation promotes dissociation of cleaved RAD21 fragments from other cohesin proteins and their replacement with intact RAD21, thereby allowing restoration of the cohesin complex (Deardorff et al. 2012). HDAC8 mutations, as well as mutations in NIPBL, SMC1A and SMC3, can cause Cornelia de Lang syndrome (Deardorff et al. 2012).
