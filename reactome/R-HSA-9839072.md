display_name: HTRA2 degrades APP (Amyloid-beta precursor protein)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: About 25-30% of cellular amyloid precursor protein isoform 695 (APP695) is
  located in mitochondria, where its accumulation can cause mitochondrial dysfunction
  (Anandatheerthavarada et al. 2003). HTRA2, located in the mitochondrial intermembrane
  space, cleaves APP695 to yield a 161 amino acid C-terminal fragment (C161) that
  is translocated to the cytosol (Park et al. 2006). The fate of the remaining 534
  amino acid N-terminal fragment of the APP695 protein is unknown. The amyloid-beta
  cleavage product of APP, which is associated with Alzheimer's Disease, binds HTRA2
  in the cytosol (Park et al. 2004).
