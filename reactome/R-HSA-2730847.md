display_name: Hydrolysis of PIP2 by PLCG
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is cleaved in to two most important
  second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) by
  phospholipase C (PLC). DAG remains within the membrane and activates protein kinase
  C (PKC) while IP3 leaves the cell membrane and binds to IP3 receptor that releases
  Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
