display_name: Dissociation of hp-IRAK1/or IRAK2:TRAF6-oligomer from the p-IRAK4 :oligo-Myd88:activated
  TLR7/8 or 9 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Hyperphosphorylated IRAK1 and TRAF6 are thought to dissociate from the activated
  receptor. (Gottipati et al. 2007) but the IRAK1:TRAF6 complex may remain associated
  with the membrane (Dong et al. 2006).<p> Phosphorylated IRAK2, like its paralog
  IRAK1, possibly dissociates from the activated receptor as shown here, although
  mechanism of IRAK2 activation by IRAK4 followed by TRAF6 binding remains to be deciphered.
