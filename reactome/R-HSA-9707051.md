stable_id: R-HSA-9707051
display_name: UBXN1 binds BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The UBXN1 polypeptide can bind to and suppress the E3 ligase activity of
  autoubiquitinated BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimers. UBXN1 recognizes autoubiquitinated heterodimers
  through a bipartite interaction in which its UBA domain binds the conjugated K6-linked
  polyubiquitin chains of BRCA1:BARD1 while its C-terminal region binds BRCA1:BARD1
  in a ubiquitin-independent manner.
