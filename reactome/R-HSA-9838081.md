display_name: LONP1 degrades mitochondrial matrix proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATP hydrolysis drives translocation of the substrate protein to the active
  site of LONP1 (Ambro et al. 2014, Mohammed et al. 2022) where it induces the active
  conformation of LONP1 (Shin et al. 2021). LONP1 predominantly cleaves peptide bonds
  adjacent to hydrophobic amino acid residues (He et al. 2018). LONP1 degrades several
  mitochondrial matrix proteins (Lee et al. 2021), including steroidogenic acute regulatory
  protein (STAR) (Ondrovicova et al. 2005), the helicase TWNK (Twinkle, PEO1) (Kunova
  et al. 2017), oxidized aconitase (ACO2) (Bota and Davies 2002), HMGCS2 (Bai et al.
  2023), and unassembled ribosomal subunits (Kunova et al. 2017). Phosphorylation
  of the HMG1 domain of TFAM prevents DNA binding and LONP1 specifically degrades
  TFAM that is not bound to DNA (Lu et al. 2013). LONP1 in association with mtHSP70
  also possesses an ATP-dependent chaperone (protein folding) activity that is independent
  of its protease activity (Shin et al. 2021, Matsushima et al. 2021). A dominant
  mutation in LONP1 (c.901C>T; p.R301W) causes excessive protease activity and reduced
  chaperone activity that results in reduced mitochondrial function and encephalopathy
  (Besse et al. 2020). Mutations in LONP1 cause cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular,
  and skeletal anomalies (CODAS) syndrome (MIM 600373) (Dikoglu et al. 2015, Strauss
  et al. 2015).
