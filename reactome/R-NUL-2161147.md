display_name: TGFBR1 is recruited to tight junction by binding Pard6a
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FLAG-tagged mouse Pard6a exogenously expressed in human embryonic kidney
  cell line, HEK293, binds HA-tagged human TGFBR1. According to studies in confluent
  normal murine mammary monolayers, NMuMG, exogenous human Myc-tagged TGFBR1 and exogenously
  expressed mouse FLAG-tagged Pard6a co-localize with endogenous ZO1 protein, a marker
  of tight junctions (Ozdamar et al. 2005).
