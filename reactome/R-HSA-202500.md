summary: 'The IkB kinase (IKK) complex serves as the master regulator for the activation
  of NF-kB by various stimuli. It contains two catalytic subunits, IKK alpha and IKK
  beta, and a regulatory subunit, IKKgamma/NEMO. The activation of IKK complex is
  dependent on the phosphorylation of IKK alpha/beta at its activation loop and the
  K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO. This basic trimolecular complex is referred to
  as the IKK complex. <br>IKK subunits have a N-term kinase domain a leucine zipper
  (LZ) motifs, a helix-loop-helix (HLH) and a C-ter NEMO binding domain (NBD). IKK
  catalytic subunits are dimerized through their LZ motifs.  IKK beta is the major
  IKK catalytic subunit for NF-kB activation. Activated TAK1 phosphorylate IKK beta
  on serine residues (S177 and S181) in the activation loop and thus activate the
  IKK kinase activity, leading to the IkB alpha phosphorylation and NF-kB activation. '
