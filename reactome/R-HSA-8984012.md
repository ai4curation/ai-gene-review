display_name: JAK1,JAK2 bound to IL27RA:IL12RB2 receptor are phosphorylated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin 35 (IL35) presumably signal via a complex that includes Interleukin
  27 receptor subunit alpha (Il27RA), Interleukin 12 receptor subunit beta 2 (IL12RB2)
  and the associated Tyrosine protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and JAK2 (Wang et al. 2014).
  Downstream, these JAKs are believed to phosphorylate Signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT3 (Stark GR and Darnell JE, 2012). As the series
  of events that induces JAK/STAT phosphorylation events in response to IL35 are not
  clear, this event is represented as a black box.
