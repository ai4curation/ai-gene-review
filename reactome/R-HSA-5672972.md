## Summary

RAF kinases have restricted substrate specificity and have as their primary substrates the two MAP2K proteins MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 (also known as MEK1 and 2). MAP2K1 knockout is embryonic lethal in mice, while MAP2K2 knockouts have no apparent abnormalities, suggesting that MAP2K1 can compensate for MAP2K2 in vivo (Giroux et al, 1999; Belanger et al, 2003). MAP2K proteins exist as stable homo- and heterodimers independent of growth factor stimulation and are generally recruited to activated RAF proteins in conjunction with a scaffolding protein and the MAP2K substrates, MAPK1 and 3 (also known as ERK1 and 2) (Ohren et al, 2004; Catalanotti et al, 2009; Catling et al, 1995; reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011; Roskoski et al, 2012a; Roskoski et al, 2012b). <br><br>Scaffolding proteins promote signaling by providing a docking platform that colocalizes components of the signaling cascade, and provide specificity by controlling the spatial and temporal regulation of the pathway (reviewed in Brown and Sacks, 2009; Matallanas et al, 2011).
