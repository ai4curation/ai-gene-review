display_name: Oxidative demethylation of 3-meC damaged DNA By ALKBH3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ALKBH3, a homolog of E.coli AlkB (Trewick et al. 2002), removes the methyl
  group from 3-methylcytosine (3-meC) in a reaction dependent on alpha-ketoglutarate,
  oxygen and Fe2+. ALKBH3 directly reverses the alkylating damage of DNA in the form
  of 3-meC, releasing formaldehyde (Duncan et al. 2002). The reversal of alkylating
  damage of dsDNA by ALKBH3 requires the presence of DNA helicase ASCC3, a component
  of the activating signal co-integrator complex (Dango et al. 2011). ALKBH3 can also
  repair methylated RNA (Aas et al. 2003).
