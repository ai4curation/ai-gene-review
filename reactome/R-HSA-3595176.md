display_name: Defective CHSY1 does not transfer GalNAc to chondroitin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Chondroitin sulfate synthase 1 (CHSY1) (Kitagawa et al. 2001) possesses both
  beta-1,3-glucuronate (GlcA) and beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) transferase
  activity, added alternatingly the two building blocks GlcA and GalNAc to the growing
  chondroitin chain. Complete or almost complete loss of CHSY1 results in temtamy
  preaxial brachydactyly syndrome (TPBS; MIM:605282), an autosomal recessive characterized
  by limb malformations, short stature, and hearing loss. Mutations in CHSY1 leading
  to loss of function include E33Sfs*34, G19_L28del, P539R and Q69* (Temtamy et al.
  1998, Li et al. 2010).
