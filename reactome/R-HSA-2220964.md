display_name: NICD1 PEST domain mutants in complex with RBPJ (CSL) bind MAML
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NICD1 PEST domain mutants in complex with RBPJ and SNW1 are expected, similar
  to the wild-type NICD1:RBPJ:SNW1 complex, to recruit MAML and histone acetylatransferases
  to form the NOTCH1 PEST domain mutants coactivator complex (Fryer et al. 2002, Wallberg
  et al. 2002, Nam et al. 2006).

## Summary

NICD1 PEST domain mutants in complex with RBPJ and SNW1 are expected, similar to the wild-type NICD1:RBPJ:SNW1 complex, to recruit MAML and histone acetylatransferases to form the NOTCH1 PEST domain mutants coactivator complex (Fryer et al. 2002, Wallberg et al. 2002, Nam et al. 2006).
