stable_id: R-HSA-450620
display_name: p-S193-KSRP binds 14-3-3zeta in the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: KSRP phosphorylated at serine193 binds 14-3-3zeta (YWHAZ) which impairs the
  ability of KSRP to destabilize RNA. Thus the RNAs become stabilized. KSRP is able
  to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. 14-3-3zeta is nucleoplasmic. Binding
  of KSRP to 14-3-3zeta causes KSRP to be retained in the nucleus.
