display_name: Activation of ISG15 by UBA7 E1 ligase
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Ubiquitin ligase UBE1L is the ISG15 activating enzyme. UBE1L activates ISG15
  in an ATP-dependent process that links UBE1L to ISG15 via a thioester bond. Arginine
  153 (R153) in human ISG15 is identified as the key residue for ISG15 and UBE1L's
  interaction.
