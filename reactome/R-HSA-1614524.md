display_name: PXLP-CBS tetramers condenses HCYS and L-Ser to form L-Cystathionine
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The first step of homocysteine conversion to cysteine is catalyzed by cystathionine
  beta-lyase, which adds a serine molecule to the substrate. The enzyme is a tetramer
  with two heme molecules as cofactor  (Janosik et al. 2001). CBS also utilises pyridoxal
  5'-phosphate (PXLP) as cofactor, at the evolutionarily conserved Lys119 residue
  (Kery et al. 1999). The cystathionine beta-synthase-like protein (CBSL) is thought
  to function like CBS.
