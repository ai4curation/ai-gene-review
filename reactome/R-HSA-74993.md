summary: Dissociation of paused ternary complexes requires the Polymerase I-transcript
  release factor (PTRF) a leucine zipper protein. PTRF is capable of dissociating
  ternary Pol I transcription complexes, interacting with both TTF-I and Pol I to
  mediate the release of both Pol I and nascent transcripts from the template.

## Summary

Dissociation of paused ternary complexes requires the Polymerase I-transcript release factor (PTRF) a leucine zipper protein. PTRF is capable of dissociating ternary Pol I transcription complexes, interacting with both TTF-I and Pol I to mediate the release of both Pol I and nascent transcripts from the template.
