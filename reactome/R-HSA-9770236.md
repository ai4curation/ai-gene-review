summary: Two magnesium ions coordinated by 4 phosphate groups of the U6 snRNA in the
  Spliceosomal C* complex (Bertram et al. 2017, Zhang et al. 2017) catalyze the transesterification
  reaction between the 3' nucleotide residue of the upstream exon and the 5' nucleotide
  residue of the downstream exon. The 3' hydroxyl group of the upstream exon nucleophilically
  attacks the 5' phosphate group of the downstream exon and the magnesium ions stabilize
  the pentacovalent transition state. Upon completion of exon ligation, the Spliceosomal
  P complex (post-catalytic complex) is formed. CACTIN, SDE2, NKAP, and PKRIP1 originally
  present in the Spliceosomal C* complex stabilize the branch helix (Fica et al. 2019,
  Zhang et al. 2019). FAM32A, not found in yeast, bridges the upstream exon and the
  3' splice site of the intron in the Spliceosomal P complex (Fica et al. 2019). An
  Exon Junction Complex (EJC) is bound to the upstream exon 20-24 nucleotides upstream
  of the splice site (Zhang and Krainer 2007, Zhang et al. 2019). SRRM2 and CWC22
  are also bound to the upstream exon (Zhang et al. 2019). ALYREF, which was initially
  recruited to the cap binding complex of the early spliceosome, now becomes associated
  with EJCs and nearby regions on the spliced mRNA (Zhou et al. 2000, Chi et al. 2013).
  Auxiliary factors, the ASAP complex or the PSAP complex also bind the EJC (Tange
  et al. 2005). DHX8 (homolog of yeast Prp22) which will dissociate the spliced mRNP
  from the Intron Lariat Spliceosome is bound to PRPF8 (homolog of yeast Prp8) (Zhang
  et al. 2019). The components of the Spliceosomal P complex have been ascertained
  using proteomic and structural methods (Kataoka and Dreyfuss 2004, Ilagan et al.
  2013, Fica et al. 2019).

## Summary

Two magnesium ions coordinated by 4 phosphate groups of the U6 snRNA in the Spliceosomal C* complex (Bertram et al. 2017, Zhang et al. 2017) catalyze the transesterification reaction between the 3' nucleotide residue of the upstream exon and the 5' nucleotide residue of the downstream exon. The 3' hydroxyl group of the upstream exon nucleophilically attacks the 5' phosphate group of the downstream exon and the magnesium ions stabilize the pentacovalent transition state. Upon completion of exon ligation, the Spliceosomal P complex (post-catalytic complex) is formed. CACTIN, SDE2, NKAP, and PKRIP1 originally present in the Spliceosomal C* complex stabilize the branch helix (Fica et al. 2019, Zhang et al. 2019). FAM32A, not found in yeast, bridges the upstream exon and the 3' splice site of the intron in the Spliceosomal P complex (Fica et al. 2019). An Exon Junction Complex (EJC) is bound to the upstream exon 20-24 nucleotides upstream of the splice site (Zhang and Krainer 2007, Zhang et al. 2019). SRRM2 and CWC22 are also bound to the upstream exon (Zhang et al. 2019). ALYREF, which was initially recruited to the cap binding complex of the early spliceosome, now becomes associated with EJCs and nearby regions on the spliced mRNA (Zhou et al. 2000, Chi et al. 2013).
