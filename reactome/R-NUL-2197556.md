species: Homo sapiens
summary: By expressing mouse Notch2deltaE recombinant protein, which mimics the cleavage
  product of Adam10, NEXT2, in human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, Saxena et
  al. demonstrated that the activity of the gamma-secretase complex was required for
  the release of Notch2 intracellular domain, NICD2, and the ensuing NICD2-mediated
  transcriptional response (Saxena et al. 2001).
