display_name: Cyclin E:CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of RB1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cyclin E (CCNE1 or CCNE2) forms a complex with CDK2 and collaborates with
  the cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 in phosphorylating RB1 (Kelly et al.1998,
  Adams et al.1999). CDK4/CDK6-mediated monophosphorylation of RB1 is a pre-requisite
  for hyperphosphorylation and full inactivation of RB1 mediated by the CCNE:CDK2
  complex (Connell-Crowley et al. 1997, Lundberg and Weinberg 1998, Brown et al. 1999,
  Harbour et al. 1999, Yu et al. 2000, Ezhevsky et al. 2001), with monophosphorylated
  RB1 being phosphorylated on 14 CDK sites out of 16 predicted sites (Narasimha et
  al. 2014).
