stable_id: R-HSA-909729
display_name: Activation of JAK kinases
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The two chains IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are pre-associated with the JAK kinases
  TYK2 and JAK1, respectively. Receptor heterodimerization brings these JAK kinases
  into close proximity and they are activated by reciprocal trans-phosphorylation.
  Tyr-1054 and Tyr-1055 within the activation loop of TYK2 sub-domain VII are critical
  for TYK2 activation. For JAK1 two tyrosine residues with in the KEYY motif (Tyr
  1034 and Tyr 1035) of the kinase domain are thought to be transphosphorylated.
