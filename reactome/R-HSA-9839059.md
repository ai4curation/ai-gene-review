display_name: AFG3L2:SPG7 degrades SMDT1 (EMRE)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AFG3L2 and SPG7 (Paraplegin) form a heterohexameric zinc metalloprotease
  that is anchored in the mitochondrial inner membrane and protrudes into the mitochondrial
  matrix (Atorino et al. 2003, Koppen et al. 2007). Each subunit of AFG3L2 and SPG7
  contains a membrane-proximal protein unfolding ATPase domain and a membrane-distal
  protease domain (Karlberg et al. 2009, Puchades et al. 2019). The protein substrate
  threads through the central pore formed by ATPase domains and is processively unfolded
  and translocated by an ATP-dependent mechanism to enter the central pore formed
  by the protease domains, where it is degraded (Puchades et al. 2019). The AFG3L2:SPG7
  complex binds and degrades SMDT1 (EMRE), an inner membrane localized regulatory
  subunit of the MCU complex, which imports calcium into the mitochondrial matrix
  (Konig et al. 2016, Tsai et al. 2017).
