stable_id: R-HSA-9929535
display_name: CCNA:CDK1 phosphorylates WEE1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CCNA2 binds to WEE1 in G2 (Pagliuca et al. 2011) and the CCNA2:CDK1 complex
  phosphorylates WEE1 (Deibler and Kirschner 2010, Pagliuca et al. 2011, Dumitru et
  al. 2017) on threonine residues T187 and T190 (Pagliuca et al. 2011), thus inhibiting
  WEE1 activity and facilitating the activation of CCNB:CDK1 complexes (Deibler and
  Kirschner 2010). The CCNA1:CDK1 complex is annotated as a candidate WEE1 kinase.
