stable_id: R-HSA-77283
display_name: (S)-3-Hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA+NAD<=>3-Oxotetradecanoyl-CoA+NADH+H
species: Homo sapiens
summary: At the beginning of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'NAD+', and 1 molecule of
  '(S)-3-Hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA' are present. At the end of this reaction, 1 molecule
  of 'H+', 1 molecule of '3-Oxotetradecanoyl-CoA', and 1 molecule of 'NADH' are present.<br><br>
  This reaction takes place in the 'mitochondrial matrix' and  is mediated by the
  '3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity' of 'Trifunctional Protein'.<br>
