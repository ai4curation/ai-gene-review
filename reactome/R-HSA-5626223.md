display_name: C2CD3 and OFD1 recruit 5 distal appendage proteins to the centriole
species: Homo sapiens
summary: C2CD3 and the centrosome component OFD1 are required for the recruitment
  of distal appendage proteins CEP164, CEP83/CCDC41, CEP89, FBF1 and SCLT1 to the
  mother centriole (Ye et al, 2014; Tang et al, 2013; Singla et al, 2010).  Distal
  appendage proteins are believed to form part of the transition fibres that anchor
  the basal bodies to the actin rich cortex at the base of the emerging cilium, and
  are also required for the recruitment and binding of ciliary vesicles and intraflagellar
  transport (IFT) complexes (Tanos et al, 2013; Wei et al, 2013; Joo et al, 2010;
  Schmidt et al, 2012; Sillibourne et al, 2013; Ye et al, 2014; reviewed in Winey
  and O'Toole, 2014).
