species: Homo sapiens
summary: The reversible reduction of 1,3BPG (1,3-bisphosphoglycerate) to form G3P
  (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) is catalyzed by cytosolic GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase) tetramer.<p>There are multiple human GAPDH-like pseudogenes, but
  only one GAPDH gene expressed in somatic tissue (Benham and Povey 1989). Consistent
  with this conclusion, the homogeneous enzymes purified from various human tissues
  had indistinguishable physical and immunochemical properties (Heinz and Freimuller
  1982), and studies of human erythrocytes of various ages suggested that variant
  forms of the enzyme arise as a result of post-translational modifications (Edwards
  et al. 1976). There is, however, an authentic second isoform of GAPDH whose expression
  is confined to spermatogenic cells of the testis (Welch et al. 2000).
