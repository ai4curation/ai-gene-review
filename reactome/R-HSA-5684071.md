stable_id: R-HSA-5684071
display_name: RNF4 ubiquitinates MDC1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SUMOylation of MDC1 by PIAS4 creates a docking site for RNF4, an E3 ubiquitin
  ligase. RNF4 binds to MDC1 specifically when SUMO2 is attached to lysine K1840 of
  MDC1. RNF4 polyubiquitinates MDC1 through ubiquitin lysine residue K48 cross-linking.
  RNF4-mediated ubiquitination targets MDC1 for degradation and causes dissociation
  of MDC1-bound proteins from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). While additional regulation
  steps may be involved, the activity of RNF4 is necessary for the initiation of resection
  of DNA ends at DSBs and progression of homologous recombination (Luo et al. 2012,
  Yin et al. 2012, Galanty et al. 2012).
