display_name: Intraphagosomal pH is lowered to 5 by V-ATPase
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The function of V-type proton pumping ATPases is basically the same as that
  of F-type ATPases, except that V-ATPases cannot synthesize ATP from the proton motive
  force, the reverse reaction of pumping. When pumping, ATP hydrolysis drives a 120
  degree rotation of the rotor which leads to movement of three protons into the phagosome
  (Adachi et al. 2007).

## Summary

When pumping, ATP hydrolysis drives a 120 degree rotation of the rotor which leads to movement of three protons into the phagosome (Adachi et al. 2007).
