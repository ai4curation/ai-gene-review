summary: Proteasome chaperone proteins PSMG1 (also known as PAC1, ortholog of yeast
  Pba1) and PSMG2 (also known as PAC2, ortholog of yeast Pba2) form a dimer originally
  reported in yeast (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013) and subsequently confirmed
  in human cells (Hirano et al. 2005; Hirano et al. 2006).
