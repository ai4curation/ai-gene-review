  subunit:peptidyl-tRNA with nascent peptide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ABCE1 bound to PELO near the P site of the 80S ribosome hydrolyzes ATP, causing
  dissociation of the 80S ribosome into 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits (Shao et al.
  2013, Shao and Hegde 2014, and inferred from the yeast homologs DOM34:HBS1 and archaeal
  homologs in Becker et al. 2012, inferred from the yeast homologs in Saito et al.
  2013). Cryo-EM structures of archaeal homologs indicate that ABCE1 remains associated
  with the 40S ribosomal subunit (Becker et al. 2012, reviewed in Franckenberg et
  al. 2012). The dissociated 60S subunit still carries the peptidyl-tRNA at the P
  site.

The dissociated 60S subunit still carries the peptidyl-tRNA at the P site.
