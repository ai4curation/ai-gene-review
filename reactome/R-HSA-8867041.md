display_name: EGFR phosphorylates EPS15
species: Homo sapiens
summary: EPS15 is phosphorylated at Y849 by activated EGFR (Confalonieri et al, 2000).  While
  the roles of phosphorylation and ubiquitination in EGFR endocytosis are unclear,
  emerging evidence suggests that EPS15 phosphorylation may target the activated EGFR
  complex for endocytosis through a clathrin-mediated route, while dephosphorylation
  at Y849 may direct the receptor complex into a clathrin-independent route (Confalonieri
  et al, 2002; de Melker et al, 2004; Li et al, 2015; reviewed in van Bergen en Henegouwen,
  2009).
