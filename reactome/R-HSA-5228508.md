stable_id: R-HSA-5228508
display_name: RANBP2 SUMOylates PML with SUMO1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RANBP2 of the nuclear pore complex SUMOylates PML with SUMO1 at lysine-65,
  lysine-160, and lysine-490 (Sternsdorf et al. 1997, Kamitani et al. 1998, Duprez
  et al. 1999). SUMOylated PML is observed during interphase but not during mitosis
  (Everett et al. 1999). RANBP2 contains both a binding site for SUMO1 and a binding
  site for UBE2I (Tatham et al. 2005). The binding site for SUMO1 may play a role
  in SUMOylation of PML with SUMO1. Knockdown of RANBP2 reduces the number of PML
  bodies (Saitoh et al. 2006).
