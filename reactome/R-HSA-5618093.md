summary: The chaperoning function of HSP90 is coupled to its ATPase activity. Our

  et al. 2003, 2004; Ali MM et al. 2006; Prodromou C et al. 2000; Prodromou C 2012).
  The ATPase cycle of human HSP90 is less well understood, however several studies
  suggest that the underlying enzymatic mechanisms and a set of conformational changes
  that accompany the ATPase cycle are highly similar in both species (Richter K et
  al. 2008; Vaughan CK et al. 2009). Once ATP is bound it helps to stabilize the closed
  ATP lid state, in which the gamma-phosphate of ATP provides a hydrogen bonding that
  promotes a stable association of the ATP lid with N-terminal domain (NTD) (Ali MM
  et al. 2006; Prodromou C et al. 2000; Chadli A et al. 2000). The association of
  ATP with NTD then stimulates structural changes in NTD and in the middle domain
  that are likely to involve movements of the ATP lid segment within each N-terminal
  domain that locates over the bound ATP. The movement of the lids exposes surface
  residues that are subsequently involved in transient dimerization of the N-terminal
  domains of HSP90 (Ali MM et al. 2006; Prodromou C et al. 2000; Chadli A et al. 2000).
  Furthermore, the intrachain associations of NTD with the middle domain leads to
  the active conformation of the catalytic loop of HSP90,  which commits the ATP for
  hydrolysis (Meyer P et al. 2003). The subsequent conformational changes upon ATP
  binding are regulated by co-chaperone activities. For example, arrangement of the
  STIP1 domains in the complex seems to prevent the NTDs dimerization of HSP90 monomers
  and total closure of the HSP90 dimer that is required for an efficient HSP90-mediated
  ATP hydrolysis (Southworth DR & Agard DA 2011; Alvira S et al. 2014). In addition,
  client protein binding to HSP90 was found to increase ATPase activity of HSP90 up
  to 200-fold (McLaughlin SH et al. 2002).<p>After hydrolysis of ATP the ligand-bound
  steroid hormone receptor (SHR) is released from HSP90 complex. The Reactome module
