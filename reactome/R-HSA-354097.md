display_name: Activation of Talin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Talin is one of the major cytoskeletal proteins involved in integrin activation
  and linking the resulting focal adhesion (FA) with cytoskeleton. Talin comprises
  an N-ter head region and a flexible rod domain. The head region has the FERM domain
  (subdivided into F1, F2 and F3 subdomains), which has the binding sites for beta
  integrin cytoplasmic regions and actin binding sites close to the C-terminal rod
  domain.  <br>Talin exists in closed inactive conformation, where the head region
  interacts with the rod domain masking the integrin binding sites. At the plasma
  membrane the RIAM bound to active Rap1 recruits talin to form the integrin activation
  complex. This interaction exposes the integrin-binding site in talin F3 domain leading
  to integrin activation. <br>
