summary: 'AP-2 is a heterotetrameric complex that was originally identified as a factor
  required to help assemble clathrin at the plasma membrane to promote endocytosis
  (Keen et al, 1987; reviewed in Robinson, 2015). In addition to its structural role,
  AP-2 also contributes to cargo recognition and recruitment through direct binding
  of tyrosine- and dileucine-based sorting motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of cargo
  such as the transferrin receptor, cation dependent and independent mannose-6-phosphate
  receptors, CFTR, CD3 and CD4 proteins, glucose transporters and the viral Nef protein,
  among many others (Collawn et al, 1990; Jadot et al, 1992; Storch and Braulke, 2001;
  Ohno et al, 1995; Letourneur and Klausner, 1992; Kelly et al, 2008; Schmidt et al,

  et al, 2010; Fu et al, 2012; reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013).  Both membrane
  recruitment and interaction of AP-2 with the sorting signals of cargo are mediated
  by the large ''trunk'' domain of AP-2, made up of the medium and small subunits
  and the N-terminal domains of the 2 large subunits (Collins et al, 2002; Heuser

## Summary

AP-2 is a heterotetrameric complex that was originally identified as a factor required to help assemble clathrin at the plasma membrane to promote endocytosis (Keen et al, 1987; reviewed in Robinson, 2015). In addition to its structural role, AP-2 also contributes to cargo recognition and recruitment through direct binding of tyrosine- and dileucine-based sorting motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of cargo such as the transferrin receptor, cation dependent and independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors, CFTR, CD3 and CD4 proteins, glucose transporters and the viral Nef protein, among many others (Collawn et al, 1990; Jadot et al, 1992; Storch and Braulke, 2001; Ohno et al, 1995; Letourneur and Klausner, 1992; Kelly et al, 2008; Schmidt et al, 2006; Doray et al, 2007; Chaudhuri et al, 2007; Lindwasser et al, 2008; Collaco et al, 2010; Fu et al, 2012; reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013).
