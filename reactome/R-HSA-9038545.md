display_name: miR-613 binds to the 3'UTR of the NR1H3 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Translation of liver X receptor α (LXRα or NR1H3) mRNA is negatively regulated
  by microRNA 613 (miR-613), which binds directly to the specific miRNA response element
  (613MRE) within the 3'UTR of NR1H3 mRNA (Ou Z et al. 2011; Zhong D et al. 2013).
  The expression of miR-613 itself was induced upon the activation of NR1H3. However,
  miR-613 did not appear to be a direct NR1H3 target gene (Ou Z et al. 2011). Instead,
  the positive regulation of miR-613 by NR1H3 was mediated by the sterol regulatory
  element binding protein (SREBP)-1c, a known NR1H2,3 target gene (Ou Z et al. 2011).
  The binding of miR-613 to NR1H3 mRNA repressed lipogenesis in human liver carcinoma
  HepG2 cells and this was reversed by NR1H3 overexpression (Zhong D et al. 2013).
