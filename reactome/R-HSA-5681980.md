stable_id: R-HSA-5681980
display_name: ATG12 binds ATG7 dimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'ATG7 acts as an E1-like enzyme for ATG12. It binds to and activates ATG12,
  allow its transfer to the E2-like ATG10.


  The amino-acid sequence of ATG12 ends with a glycine residue and does not require
  protease activation. ATG12 is activated by forming a thioester bond between its
  C-terminal Gly-140 and Cys-572 of ATG7 (Tanida et al. 1999, 2001). ATG7 has been
  shown to function in the form of a homodimer (Komatsu et al. 2001).'
