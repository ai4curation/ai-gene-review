stable_id: R-HSA-8944650
display_name: miR-214 microRNA binds PTEN mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA miR-214-3p, one of the two mature products of miR-214, binds to
  the 3'UTR of the PTEN mRNA and inhibits PTEN mRNA translation. As miR-214 reduces
  PTEN protein levels but not PTEN mRNA levels, miR-214 presumably functions as part
  of the nonendonucleolytic RISC. miR-214 is frequently overexpressed in ovarian cancer
  (Yang et al. 2008).
