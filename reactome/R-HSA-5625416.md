stable_id: R-HSA-5625416
display_name: Anterograde IFT
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Anterograde trains travel along the axoneme of the cilium at an estimated
  rate of 2 micrometers per second in an ATP- and kinesin-2-dependent fashion (reviewed
  in Cole and Snell, 2009). Although the particulars of IFT train-cargo interactions
  have not been fully elaborated, recent studies in C. reinhardtii and human cells
  have shown that the IFT B components IFT74 and IFT81 have tubulin-binding sites,
  while IFT46 is required for the ciliary transport of the outer dynein arm, and more
  recently, TTC26 has been shown to be required for the transport of motility-related
  proteins into the flagella (Bhogaraju et al, 2013; Ahmed et al, 2008; Hou et al,
  2007; Ishikawa et al, 2014; reviewed in Bhogarju et al, 2014).
