summary: JAK2 is required for GH-mediated phosphorylation of STATs 1,3,5A and 5B (Smit
  et al.1996). Some STAT activation may be mediated by direct association of JAK and
  STAT but maximal activation requires binding of STATs to phosphorylated tyrosines
  of the receptor (Smit et al. 1996, Lichanska & Waters 2006). Studies using mouse
  GHR truncated at K391, equivalent to human K380, suggest that STAT5 signaling is
  mediated by distal tyrosines, with 70% of the signaling lost if the receptor is
  truncated at P569, equivalent to human P558 (Rowland et al. 2005). Wang et al. (1996)
  using the porcine receptor found that phosphorylation at any one of the positions
  Y487, Y534, Y566 or Y627 (numbering identical in humans) was sufficient to allow
  STAT5 phosphorylation. Smit et al. (1996) identified mouse residues Y341 (human
  Y332) and Y346 (not conserved in human) as required for STAT1, 3, and maximal STAT5
  activation.
