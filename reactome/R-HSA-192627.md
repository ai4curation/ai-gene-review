species: Homo sapiens
summary: The viral polymerase complex produces positive-sense viral mRNA with host-cell
  derived 5' methyl caps.  Capped viral mRNAs are selectively exported from the host
  cell nucleus through a currently unclear mechanism that may rely on components of
  the host cell mRNA export machinery (Chen, 2000; Engelhardt, 2006).  Polyadenylation
  of viral mRNA appears be required for influenza mRNA export (Poon, 2000).  A coupling
  of viral mRNA export with cellular pre-mRNA processing complexes, recruited by phosphorylation
  of host RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain which interacts with the viral polymerase
  (Engelhardt, 2005), has been proposed as controlling the export of a subset (M1,
  HA, and NS1, but not NP) of viral mRNA from the nucleus (Amorim, 2007).
