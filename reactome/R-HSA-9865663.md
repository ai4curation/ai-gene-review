display_name: MT-CO3, COX6A,B,7A and NDUFA4 bind to holo-MT-CO1,2 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The final assembly of Complex IV consists of binding of the MT-CO3, COX6A,
  COX6B, COX7A, and NDUFA4 subunits to the holo-MT-CO1, MT-CO2 complex (reviewed by,
  e.g., Timón-Gómez et al., 2018). Both HIGD1A and HIGD2A act as positive regulators
  of the final assembly (Vukotic et al., 2012; Hock et al., 2020; Timón-Gómez et al.,
  2020a; reviewed in Timón-Gómez et al., 2020b). Recent data also points to RAB5IF
  as an assembly cofactor (Moutaoufik et al., 2019). Patients with NDUFA4 mutations
  display COX deficiencies (Pitceathly et al., 2013).
