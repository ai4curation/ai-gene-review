display_name: SOS1-mediated nucleotide exchange of RAS downstream of FLT3 fusion mutants
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SOS1-mediated nucleotide exchange on RAS is presumed to occur downstream
  of activated FLT3 fusion mutants, leading to increased phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK
  proteins (Grand et al, 2007; Vu et al, 2009; Troadec et al, 2017; Chonabayashi et
  al, 2013; reviewed in Kazi and Roonstrand et al, 2019).

## Summary

SOS1-mediated nucleotide exchange on RAS is presumed to occur downstream of activated FLT3 fusion mutants, leading to increased phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK proteins (Grand et al, 2007; Vu et al, 2009; Troadec et al, 2017; Chonabayashi et al, 2013; reviewed in Kazi and Roonstrand et al, 2019).
