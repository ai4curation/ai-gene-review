stable_id: R-HSA-8951595
display_name: CALR, TAP, TAPBP dissociate from SEC22B:STX4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The interaction between the two compartments involves either direct fusion
  of ER stacks to phagosomes (Phgs) or vesicular intermediates. In both cases, a fusion
  event between the ER or ER-derived membrane vesicles and Phgs must occur. The SNARE
  SEC22B localizes to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and interacts
  with SNARE syntaxin 4 (STX4) on phagosomes (Phgs), mediating the recruitment of
  subset of ER components including transporter associated with antigen processing
  (TAP), to phagosomes (Cebrian et al. 2011).
