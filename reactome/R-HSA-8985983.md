stable_id: R-HSA-8985983
display_name: p-Y701-STAT1 dimer translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After phosphorylation on tyrosine-701, STAT1 forms an antiparallel dimer
  which exposes its nuclear import signal, causing translocation into the nucleus
  (Sekimoto et al. 1997, reviewed in McBride and Reich 2003). STAT1 is phosphorylated
  and imported into the nucleus in response to low-shear stress, a form of turbulent
  flow across endothelial cells (Lv et al. 2024).

## Summary

After phosphorylation on tyrosine-701, STAT1 forms an antiparallel dimer which exposes its nuclear import signal, causing translocation into the nucleus (Sekimoto et al. 1997, reviewed in McBride and Reich 2003). STAT1 is phosphorylated and imported into the nucleus in response to low-shear stress, a form of turbulent flow across endothelial cells (Lv et al. 2024).
