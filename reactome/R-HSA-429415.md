stable_id: R-HSA-429415
display_name: SYK binds to integrin alphaIIb beta3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Integrin alphaIIb beta3 'outside-in' signalling involves multiple proteins
  including SRC, SYK, SLP-76 and PLCgamma2. SRC is constitutively associated with
  the C-terminal tail of integrin beta 3. SYK is recruited to the beta3 tail and subsequently
  activated by SRC.
