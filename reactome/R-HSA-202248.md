display_name: Phosphorylation of PLC-gamma1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Three tyrosine residues at positions 771, 783 and 1254 in PLC-gamma1 have
  been identified as the sites of receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. Of these
  Y783 and Y1254 are required for activation of PLC-gamma1. The phosphorylation of
  the tyrosine residues and the activation of PLC-gamma1 is mediated by both Syk tyrosine
  kinase ZAP-70 and Tec kinase ITK.
