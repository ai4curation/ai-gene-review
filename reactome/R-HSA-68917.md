display_name: Cdc45 associates with the pre-replicative complex at the origin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once the Mcm2-7 complex has been assembled onto the origin of replication,
  the next step is the assembly of Cdc45, an essential replication protein, in late
  G1. The assembly of Cdc45 onto origins of replication forms a complex distinct from
  the pre-replicative complex, sometimes called the pre-initiation complex. The assembly
  of Cdc45 onto origins correlates with the time of initiation. Like the Mcm2-7 proteins,
  Cdc45 binds specifically to origins in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and then to
  non-origin DNA during S phase and is therefore thought to travel with the replication
  fork. Indeed, S. cerevisiae Cdc45 is required for DNA replication elongation as
  well as replication initiation. Cdc45 is required for the association of alpha DNA
  polymerase:primase with chromatin. Based on this observation and the observation
  that in S. cerevisiae, cCdc45 has been found in large complexes with some components
  of Mcm2-7 complex, it has been suggested that Cdc45 plays a scaffolding role at
  the replication fork, coupling Pol-alpha:primase to the replication fork through
  the helicase. Association of Cdc45 with origin DNA is regulated in the cell cycle
  and its association is dependent on the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases but
  not the Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase. In Xenopus egg extracts, association of Cdc45 with chromatin
  is dependent on Xmus101. TopBP1, the human homolog of Xmus1, is essential for DNA
  replication and interacts with DNA polymerase epsilon, one of the polymerases involved
  in replicating the genome. TopBP1 homologs have been found in S. cerevisiae and
  S. pombe. Sld3, an additional protein required for Cdc45 association with chromatin
  in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, has no known human homolog.
