display_name: Beta-catenin is released from the destruction complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Stimulation of the WNT pathway results in the recruitment of the GSK3beta:AXIN
  complex to the membrane (Willert et al, 1999; Schwarz Romond et al, 2007; Bilic
  et al, 2007; reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2013).  Activation of WNT signaling is
  believed to transiently inhibit GSK3beta kinase activity preventing its phosphorylation
  of beta-catenin (described in detail in the pathway "Degradation of beta-catenin
  by the destruction complex"; Piao et al, 2008; reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2013).
  Inhibition of GSK3beta activity also prevents phosphorylation of AXIN allowing the
  constitutive dephosphorylation of AXIN at GSK3beta-dependent phosphorylation sites
  by PP2A predominate. This is believed to weaken the interaction between AXIN and
  beta-catenin (Willert et al, 1999).  AXIN has also been shown to be dephosphorylated
  by PP1 at several serinve residues initially phosphorylated by CSNK1. The dephosphorylation
  by PP1 weakens the interaction between AXIN-GSK3beta and inhibits beta-catenin phosphorylation/degradation
  (Luo et al, 2007; reviewed in Huang et al, 2008).  A recent study suggests that
  sustained inactivation of GSK3beta may result from its sequestration in multivesicular
  bodies (Taelman et al, 2010; reviewed in Niehrs and Acebon, 2010; Schuldt, 2011).  Together,
  these changes destabilize the destruction complex and allow beta-catenin to accumulate.
