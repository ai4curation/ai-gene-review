stable_id: R-HSA-9921802
display_name: IFI6 binds HSPA5
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interferon alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) has been implicated in various
  cellular stress response pathways, potentially modulating the activity of proteins
  involved in these pathways (Richardson RB et al., 2018; Jia H et al., 2020; Hao
  J et al., 2022). This Reactome event shows interaction of IFI6 with endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) chaperone BiP (encoded by the HSPA5 gene), which is involved in protein
  folding and stress management in response to microorganisms (Richardson RB et al.,
  2018; Shin WJ e al., 2022). HSPA5 (BiP), which is primarily located in the ER lumen,
  binds unfolded proteins as well as the luminal domains of ER-membrane-bound signal
  transducers ATF6, IRE1, and PERK (EIF2AK3) that facilitate unfolded protein response
  (UPR) during ER stress (Wang J et al., 2017). The interaction between IFI6 and HSPA5
  is thought to interfere with virus-triggered ER membrane alterations, including
  invagination, preventing the formation of a specialized ER microenvironment for
  viral replication (Richardson RB et al., 2018).
