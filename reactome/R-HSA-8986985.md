display_name: IFNL1:p-Y343,Y517-IFNLR1:p-JAK1:IL10RB:p-TYK2:STAT1 phosphorylates STAT1,
  STAT2, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IFNL1 can induce phosphorylation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription
  1 alpha/beta (STAT1), Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT2),
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), Signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription
  5 (STAT5)  (Dumoutier et al. 2004, Novak et al. 2008, Dickensheets et al. 2013)
  via stimulation of the Interferon lambda-1 (IFNL1) receptor complex. This complex
  consists of IFNL1, IFNLR1, which is associated with phosphorylated Tyrosine-protein
  kinase JAK1 (JAK1), Interleukin-10 receptor beta (IL10RB), which is associated with
  phosphorylated Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase TYK2 (TYK2) and STAT1.<br>This
  is a black-box event because direct evidence for STAT4 and 5 binding and activation
  is lacking (Jordan et al. 2007).
