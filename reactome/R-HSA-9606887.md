stable_id: R-HSA-9606887
display_name: p-CD19:VAV binds PI3K and GRB2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylated CD19 binds PI3K (Roifman and Ke 1993, Chalupny et al. 1993,
  Uckun et al. 1993, Weng et al. 1994, Brooks et al. 2000,  Brooks et al. 2004) and
  can bind PLC-gamma2 (PLCG2), which competes with VAV1 for the binding to phosphotyrosine-391
  on CD19 (Brooks et al. 2000, Brooks et al. 2004). GRB2 appears to bind phosphotyrosine-330
  on CD19 (Brooks et al. 2004).
