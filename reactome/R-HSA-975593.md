display_name: PNLIP:CLPS hydrolyses RPALM to atROL and PALM
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Part of nutritional vitamin A is in the form of retinyl esters (REs). The
  main fatty acids which can form esters with  retinol are palmitate, oleate, stearate
  and linoleate. REs are digested together with other lipids, and by the same enzymes.
  Pancreatic lipase catalyses the hydrolysis of RE to all-trans-retinol (atROL) and
  fatty acid which are then both taken up by enterocytic cell membranes (Bennekum
  et al. 2000).
