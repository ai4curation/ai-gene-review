summary: While binding of GOPC (also known as CAL, PIST or FIG) to CFTR (cystic fibrosis
  transmembrane conductance regulator) promotes lysosomal degradation of CFTR, binding
  of active RHOQ to GOPC:CFTR complex redirects CFTR to the plasma membrane and prevents
  its degradation (Cheng et al. 2005).

## Summary

While binding of GOPC (also known as CAL, PIST or FIG) to CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) promotes lysosomal degradation of CFTR, binding of active RHOQ to GOPC:CFTR complex redirects CFTR to the plasma membrane and prevents its degradation (Cheng et al. 2005).
