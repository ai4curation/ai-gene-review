stable_id: R-HSA-5696914
display_name: USP28 deubiquitinates CLSPN and MYC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: USP28 is Involved in DNA damage induced apoptosis by specifically stabilizing
  and deubiquitinating proteins of the DNA damage pathway including CLSPN (Zhang et
  al. 2006). It also binds to the nucleoplasmic alpha isoform of Fbw7, counteracting
  FBW7 ubiquitin ligase activity by deubiquitinating MYC in the nucleoplasm, which
  reduces MYC proteasomal degradation (Popov et al. 2007).
