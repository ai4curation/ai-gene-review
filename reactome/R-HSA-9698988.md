  Nucleocapsid
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'SARS-CoV-2 virions attached to the host cell surface via a complex involving
  viral spike (S) protein and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) can directly
  fuse their membrane with the host cell membrane, releasing the uncoated virion nucleocapsid
  into the cytoplasm. The process starts with the spike protein undergoing cleavage
  by furin into S1/S2, followed by cleavage of S2 catalyzed by TMPRSS2, freeing the
  fusion peptide (FP) which mediates membrane fusion.


  Heparin binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) effectively inhibits its cleavage into S1,
  S2 by furin. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) exhibits a higher furin inhibitory potency
  than the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (Paiardi et al, 2021). However, cleavage
  at the S1/S2 site occurs to some extent even if furin is absent, presumably due
  to the action of other proprotein convertases (Papa et al, 2021; Jaimes et al, 2020;
  reviewed by Takeda, 2022).

## Summary

SARS-CoV-2 virions attached to the host cell surface via a complex involving viral spike (S) protein and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) can directly fuse their membrane with the host cell membrane, releasing the uncoated virion nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm.
