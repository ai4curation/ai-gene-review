species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphotyrosine on STAT2 acts as docking site for STAT1 molecules. STAT1
  binds to phosphorylated STAT2 and this is followed by STAT1 phosphorylation on tyrosine
  residue 701 (Y701). These STATs recruited to the phosporylated IFNAR1 form two distinct
  transcriptional activator complexes, namely, IFN-alpha-activated factor (AAF) and
  IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). AAF is a homodimer of STAT1, whereas ISGF3
  is a heterotrimeric complex of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 (also known as p48 or ISGF3gamma)
  (Honda et al. 2005).
