display_name: RUNX1 regulates transcription of genes involved in differentiation of
  HSCs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The RUNX1:CBFB complex regulates transcription of the SPI1 (PU.1) gene, involved
  in differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). RUNX1 recruits histone methyltransferase
  KMT2A (MLL) to the SPI1 gene locus, leading to generation of the activating H3K4Me3
  mark on nucleosomes associated with the SPI1 promoter and the upstream regulatory
  element (Huang et al. 2011). SPI1 transactivation represses self-renewal and proliferation
  of HSCs (Fukuchi et al. 2008) and is needed for commitment of HSCs to specific hematopoietic
  lineages (Imperato et al. 2015).<br>As a component of the TAL1 transcription factor
  complex, involved in acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), RUNX1 can promote
  growth and inhibit apoptosis of hematopoietic stem cells by stimulating transcription
  of the MYB gene and possibly the TRIB2 gene (Sanda et al. 2012, Mansour et al. 2014).
