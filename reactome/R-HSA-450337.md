display_name: Activated TAK1 phosphorylates MKK4/MKK7
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In human, phosphorylation of MKK4 (MAP2K4) and MKK7 (MAP2K7) by TAK1 occurs
  at the typical Ser-Xaa-Ala-Xaa-Thr motif in their activation loops.<p>Residues involved
  in activation of these protein kinases correspond to human Ser271, Thr275 in MKK7
  and Ser257, Thr261 in MKK4.<p>Cell lines lacking MKK4 exhibit defective activation
  of JNK and AP-1 dependent transcription activity in response to some cellular stresses;
  JNK and p38 MAPK activities were decreased by around 80% and 20%, respectively,
  following deletion of the mkk4 gene.
