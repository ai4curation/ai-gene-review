stable_id: R-HSA-5218824
display_name: p-6Y-VEGFR2 binds FYN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Tyrosine-1214 phosphorylation allows recruitment of cytoplasmic tyrosine
  kinase FYN along with NCK to VEGFR2. FYN and NCK associate with each other. This
  complex mediates phosphorylation of p21-activated protein kinase 2 (PAK2) and subsequent
  activation of p38MAPK mediating actin reorganization and cell migration (Lamalice
  et al. 2006).
