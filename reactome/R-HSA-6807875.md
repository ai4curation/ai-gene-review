summary: Binding and polymerization of the coatomer (the COPI coat) is coordinated
  with the incorporation of cargo proteins and Golgi-targeting snares, as well as
  with recruitment of ARFGAP proteins (Letourneur et al, 1994; Nagahama et al,1996;
  Bremser et al, 1999). <br>Typical model cargo for COPI-mediated trafficking includes
  the viral glycoprotein VSV-G and proinsulin as well as the KDEL receptors, which
  bind and recycle ER-resident proteins and which themselves must be returned to post-ER
  compartments (Cosson and Letourner, 1994; Ben-Tekaya et al, 2005; Majoul et al,
  2001; Orci et al, 1997, Bremser et al, 1999; Presley et al, 1997; reviewed in Beck
  et al, 2009). <br>Other protein components of the COPI vesicle include the p24 family
  of proteins, which serve diverse roles in the early secretory pathway (reviewed
  in Schuiki and Volchuk, 2012).  Oligomeric p24 proteins interact with ADP-bound
  ARF and components of the COPI coat, contributing to coatomer recruitment and oligomerization
  (Gommel et al, 2001; Majoul et al, 2001; Bethune et al, 2006; Harter and Wieland,
  1998; Langer et al, 2008; Reinhard et al, 1999). The p24 proteins also act as cargo
  receptors for various proteins destined for packaging in COPI vesicles; these include
  GPI-anchored transmembrane proteins, WNT ligands and some G-protein coupled receptors
  (Takida et al, 2008; Bonnon et al, 2010; Luo et al, 2011; Beuchling et al, 2011;
  Wang and Kazanietz, 2002; reviewed in Schuiki and Volchuk, 2012). Finally, the p24
  proteins contribute to COPI coat disassembly by restricting ARF GTPase activity
  until cargo has been loaded (Goldberg, 2000; Lanoix et al, 2001).  <br>ARFGAPs are
  recruited to the budding vesicle through direct interaction with active ARF, the
  cytoplasmic tails of cargo proteins and with components of the COPI coat (Goldberg,
  2000; Majoul et al, 2001; Aoe et al, 1997; Kliouchnikov et al, 2009; Luo et al,
  2009).  Stimulation of ARF GTPase activity is coordinated with cargo recruitment
  to ensure that only cargo-loaded vesicles are produced (Goldberg, 2000; Luo et al,
  2009). <br>Mammalian cells have 3 ARFGAPs that appear to be involved in COPI-mediated
  traffic, ARFGAP1,2 and 3 (Frigerio et al, 2007; Liu et al, 2001; Kahn et al, 2008).
  ARFGAP1 has a ALPS domain that recognizes membrane curvature and that is required
  for the GTPase stimulating activity of the protein, suggesting a mechanism for coordinating
  ARF1-mediated GTP hydrolysis with vesicle formation (Bigay et al, 2003; Mesmin et
  al, 2007). ARFGAP 2 and 3 do not contain this motif, and their activity is dependent
  upon interaction with coatomer (Weimar et al 2008; Kliouchnikov et al, 2009; Luo
  et al, 2009).  <br>Finally, there is evidence that components of the ankyin/spectrin
  skeleton may be incorporated in the nascent COPI vesicle, acting as a bridge between
  cargo proteins and the dynein-dynactin complex required for their transport to the
  Golgi (Devarajan et al, 1997; Godi et al, 1998; Holleran et al, 1996; Holleran et
  al, 2001).
