stable_id: R-HSA-5633051
display_name: EFCAB7:IQCE binds EVC2:EVC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IQCE and EFCAB7 are ciliary proteins that are required to restrict the EVC2:EVC
  complex to the 'EVC region' at the base of the cilium, just distal to the transition
  zone (Pusapati et al, 2014). EVC2 and EVC are transmembrane proteins that form a
  ciliary-localized complex that is a positive regulator of Hh signal transduction.  The
  EVC2:EVC complex appears to act downstream of both SMO ciliary localization and
  its activation by CSNK1A1 and ADRBK1, and is required for the dissociation of the
  GLI:SUFU complex at the ciliary tip, although the mechanism for this is not known
  (Blair et al, 2011; Dorn et al, 2012; Capparos-Martin et al, 2013; Pusapati et al,
  2014).  EVC2 interacts with the IQCE:EFCAB7 subcomplex through the so called 'W-peptide',
  a stretch of amino acids in the intracellular tail that is deleted in the ciliopathy
  Weyers Acrofacial Dysostosis.  Deletion of the W-peptide results in mislocalization
  of EVC2 throughout the length of the cilium, rather than being concentrated in the
  'EVC zone' (Pusapati et al, 2014; Dorn et al, 2012; Capparos-Martin et al, 2011).  EVC2:EVC
  localization to the EVC region, mediated by the IQCE:EFCAB7 complex and the W-peptide,
  is required for the Hh-dependent activation of full-length GLI2, but does not appear
  to critical for the regulation of GLI3R levels, suggesting a bifurcation of the
  pathway (Pusapati et al, 2014).

## Summary

IQCE and EFCAB7 are ciliary proteins that are required to restrict the EVC2:EVC complex to the 'EVC region' at the base of the cilium, just distal to the transition zone (Pusapati et al, 2014). EVC2 and EVC are transmembrane proteins that form a ciliary-localized complex that is a positive regulator of Hh signal transduction.
