display_name: p-S311,S406 KSR1:MARK3 binds YWHAB dimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MARK3-mediated phosphorylation of S311 and particularly S406 promotes the
  binding of 14-3-3 dimers, sequestering KSR1 in the cytosol in quiescent cells (Cacace
  et al, 1999; Muller et al, 2000; Muller et al, 2001; reviewed in Raabe and Raap,
  2003).  Mutation of S406 abrogates 14-3-3 binding and results in constitutive plasma
  membrane localization of KSR1 (Muller et al, 2001).
