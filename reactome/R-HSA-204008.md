summary: 'The outer coat proteins SEC13 and SEC31A are thought to exist in a cytosolic
  heterohexamer with SEC23IP and are recruited to the ER through interaction with
  pre-bound SEC23-SEC24 complexes (Stephens et al, 2000; Hammond and Glick, 2000;
  Stagg et al. 2006; Ong et al, 2010; reviewed in Szul and Sztul, 2011). Human SEC31B
  is close to 50% identical to human SEC31A (Tang et al. 2000, Stankewich et al. 2006).
  While SEC31A is ubiquitously and abundantly expressed, SEC31B is expressed at a
  high level in testis (Tang et al. 2000: Northern blot; Stankewich et al. 2006: Northern
  blot and dot-blot), thymus (Tang et al. 2000: Northern blot; Stankewich et al. 2006:
  dot-blot), cerebellum (Stankewich et al. 2006: dot-blot), lymph node (Stankewich
  et al. 2006: dot-blot), and pituitary gland (Stankewich et al. 2006: dot-blot) and
  at a low level in other tissues (Tang et al. 2000; Stankewich et al. 2006). SEC31B
  can form dimers with SEC31A (Stankewich et al. 2006) and it co-immunoprecipitates
  and co-localizes with at least two components of the COPII coat, SEC23 and SEC13
  (Stankewich et al. 2006). The dynamic behavior of SEC31B in the cells is consistent
  with its participation with COPII-coated organelles (Stankewich et al. 2006). In
  a zebrafish model of retinal development, oligonucleotide-mediated gene knockdown
  of either sec31a or sec31b leads to loss of COPII function (Niu et al. 2014). In
  Arabidopsis, SEC31A and SEC31B were both shown to function as COPII components that
  are essential and interchangeable in pollen development (Liu et al. 2021). Based
  on experimental evidence described above, SEC31B is annotated as a candidate SEC31
  component of the COPII coat. v-SNAREs such as the SEC22 proteins are also incorporated
  into the emerging vesicle through interactions with components of the COPII coat  (Xu
  et al, 2000; Mancias and Goldberg, 2008; Gordon et al, 2010; reviewed in Szul and
  Sztul, 2011; Lord et al, 2013).'

## Summary

The outer coat proteins SEC13 and SEC31A are thought to exist in a cytosolic heterohexamer with SEC23IP and are recruited to the ER through interaction with pre-bound SEC23-SEC24 complexes (Stephens et al, 2000; Hammond and Glick, 2000; Stagg et al. 2006; Ong et al, 2010; reviewed in Szul and Sztul, 2011). Human SEC31B is close to 50% identical to human SEC31A (Tang et al. 2000, Stankewich et al. 2006).
