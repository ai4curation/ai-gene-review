summary: Two RecA homologs, Rad51 and the meiosis-specific Dmc1, coat single-stranded
  3' ends of DNA produced by resection of double-strand breaks. Rad51 and Dmc1 interact
  and colocalize to the same early recombination nodules (Ashley et al. 1995, Ikeya

  et al. 1999, Moens et al. 2007). Knockouts of Dmc1 abolish recombination and synapsis

## Summary

Two RecA homologs, Rad51 and the meiosis-specific Dmc1, coat single-stranded 3' ends of DNA produced by resection of double-strand breaks. Rad51 and Dmc1 interact and colocalize to the same early recombination nodules (Ashley et al. 1995, Ikeya et al. 1996, Plug et al. 1996, Barlow et al. 1997, Barlow et al. 1998, Tarsounas et al. 1999, Moens et al. 2007).
