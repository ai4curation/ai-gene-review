summary: Upon activation of TLR2/or 4 signaling pathway TIRAP (MAL), a TIR domain–containing
  adapter protein, undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation (Piao W et al. 2008; Gray P
  et al. 2006). Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) was shown to mediate the TIRAP phosphorylation
  (Jefferies CA et al. 2003; Gray P et al. 2006). BTK-specific inhibitor, LFM-A13,
  blocked the phosphorylation of TIRAP in human monocytic cell line THP-1 stimulated
  with LPS or macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) (Gray P et al. 2006). LFM-A13
  also inhibited activation of NFkappaB in LPS-treated THP-1 (Jefferies CA et al.
  2003). Besides BTK kinase TIRAP was shown to associate with other kinases such as
  protein kinase C delta (PKC delta) suggesting their regulatory role in TIRAP activation
  (Kubo-Murai M et al. 2007).<p>Tyr86, Tyr106 and Tyr187 were identified as possible
  phosphorylation sites (Gray P et al. 2006). An additional study has shown that Tyr86,
  Tyr106, and Tyr159 are important residues, as mutagenesis of these residues impaired
  TIRAP (MAL) phosphorylation, affected its interaction with BTK and also impaired
  downstream signaling (Piao W et al. 2008). Structural insights further confirm that
  BTK phosphorylates TIRAP at positions Tyr86 and Tyr106 (Paracha RZ et al. 2014).
  BTK-mediated phosphorylation of TIRAP leads to recruitment of suppressor of cytokine
  signaling 1 (SOCS1), which assembles K48-linked polyubiquitin chains resulting in
  TIRAP's proteosomal degradation, disrupting the TLR complex, and terminating signaling
  (Mansell A et al. 2006). TIRAP function is also regulated by the cysteine protease
  caspase-1, which cleaves the protein in a region of the molecule that interacts
  with MyD88 and TLR4 (Ulrichts P et al. 2010).
