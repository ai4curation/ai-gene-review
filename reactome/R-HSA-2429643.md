display_name: NREH hydrolyses atREs (HSPG:apoE) to atROL and FAs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once inside liver parenchymal cells, all-trans-retinyl esters (atREs), are
  hydrolysed to all-trans-retinol (atROL) and fatty acids (FAs) by a neutral, all-trans-retinyl
  ester hydrolase (NREH). No NREH has been characterised yet although both acidic
  and neutral REH activity has been shown to be associated with endosomes and plasma
  membrane preparations from rodent livers (Harrison & Gad 1989, Gad & Harrison 1991,
  Hagen et al. 1999). As the acidity increases, early endosomes change to late endosomes
  and further hydrolysis of atREs is mediated by acid retinyl ester hydrolase (AREH).
  Like NREH, AREH has not yet been characterised (see refs above). The translocation
  mechanism of atROL to cytosol is unknown.
