display_name: Recruitment of STATs by KIT mutants
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Extracellular- , juxtamembrane- and kinase-domain mutants of KIT have been
  shown to signal through the STAT pathway, although the biological relevance or each
  STAT isoform varies between tumor types (Brizzi et al, 1999; Ning et al, 2001; Frost
  et al, 2002; Growney et al, 2005; Hara et al, 2017; Obata et al, 2017; Duensing
  et al, 2004; Bauer et al, 2007; Deberry et al, 1997; Ronnstrand, 2004). Although
  the pathway details haven't been examined in all cases, STAT pathway activation
  likely occurs through the recruitment of JAK2 and SRC family kinases, as is the
  case for the wild type receptor (reviewed in Lennartsson and Roonstrand, 2012).
