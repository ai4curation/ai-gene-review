display_name: Binding of newly synthesized MHC class I heavy chain (HC) with calnexin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The newly synthesized MHC class I heavy chain (HC) translocates into the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and binds rapidly to calnexin (CNX), a transmembrane
  calcium-dependent lectin with chaperone activity. CNX recognizes and binds to an
  N-linked monoglycosylated Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 carbohydrate group found attached to the
  conserved Asn-86 in the HC. Interaction of HC with CNX promotes the formation of
  intrachain disulfide bonds. Another candidate ER chaperon protein is immunoglobulin
  binding protein (BiP), found to associate with HC in the absence of CNX. These chaperones
  can cooperate in protein folding and prevention of aggregation.
