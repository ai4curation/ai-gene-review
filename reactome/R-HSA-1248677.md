stable_id: R-HSA-1248677
display_name: Inactivation of over-expressed wild type EGFR by Cetuximab recombinant
  antibody
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cetuximab binds to the extracellular domain of EGFR and blocks ligand binding,
  leading to receptor inactivation, internalization and degradation. Cetuximab is
  approved for combination therapy and monotherapy of metastatic colorectal cancer
  and advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck in patients whose tumors over-express
  wild-type EGFR protein, usually due to amplification of EGFR gene.
