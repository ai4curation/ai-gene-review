species: Homo sapiens
summary: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-beta) is a well characterized cytokine
  and controls a variety of biological processes, it plays a pivotal role in pulmonary
  fibrosis. SARS-CoV-1 nucleocapsid protein (N) associates with SMAD3 and promotes
  SMAD3-EP300 complex formation while it interferes with the complex formation between
  SMAD3 and SMAD4. By this mechanism N modulates TGF-beta signaling to block apoptosis
  of SARS-CoV-infected host cells and meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis (Zhao et al,
  2008). Elevated PAI-1 levels, pulmonary fibrosis, and key components of the TGF-beta
  signaling pathway are also implicated in COVID-19 (Whyte et al, 2020; Wei et al,
  2020).

## Summary

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-beta) is a well characterized cytokine and controls a variety of biological processes, it plays a pivotal role in pulmonary fibrosis. SARS-CoV-1 nucleocapsid protein (N) associates with SMAD3 and promotes SMAD3-EP300 complex formation while it interferes with the complex formation between SMAD3 and SMAD4. By this mechanism N modulates TGF-beta signaling to block apoptosis of SARS-CoV-infected host cells and meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis (Zhao et al, 2008). Elevated PAI-1 levels, pulmonary fibrosis, and key components of the TGF-beta signaling pathway are also implicated in COVID-19 (Whyte et al, 2020; Wei et al, 2020).
