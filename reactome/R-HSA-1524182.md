display_name: Activated PLC gamma dissociates from the PDGF receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once phosphorylated, PLCgamma dissociates from the receptor.  The active
  enzyme promotes intracelllular signaling by catalysing  the hydrolysis of PIP2 to
  generate the second messengers IP3 and DAG.
