display_name: Recruitment of TRAF6/TRAF2 to MAVS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS or IPS-1) interacts with
  TRAF2 and TRAF6 through its consensus TRAF-interaction motif (TIM) (TRAF2 143-PVGET-147
  and TRAF6 153-PGENSE-158 & 455-PEENEY-460). Although MAVS (IPS-1) can bind to both
  TRAF6 and TRAF2, TRAF2 binding is not required for MAVS activation of NF-kappaB.
