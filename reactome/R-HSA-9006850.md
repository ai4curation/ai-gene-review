display_name: IL21 receptor JAK phosphorylation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The IL21 heteromeric receptor complex can activate JAK1 and JAK3 in response
  to Interleukin-21 (IL21), leading to JAK tyrosine phosphorylation (Asao et al.  2001,
  Habib et al. 2002).<br><br>This is a black box event because the mechanism leading
  to JAK phosphorylation is not established for this receptor complex.
