summary: Corneodesmosomes (CDS) are an ultrastructurally modified form of desmosomes
  (DS) (Chapman & Walsh 1990). When DS are transformed into CDS between the stratum
  granulosum and the stratum corneum, the desmoglea loses its trilamellar structure
  and becomes homogeneously electron dense. On the cytoplasmic side, the attachment
  plaque (desmosomal plaque) becomes incorporated into the cornified cell envelope
  (CE). Keratin filaments are connected to the attachment plaque in DS; this association
  is no longer visible in CDS.<br><br>Like DS, desmoglein and desmocollin constitute
  the extracellular parts of CDS (Simon et al. 1997), but there is an additional unique
  extracellular component known as corneodesmosin (CDSN). CDSN is a 52- to 56-kDa
  glycoprotein produced by keratinocytes that is incorporated into the desmoglea of
  DS shortly before their transformation into CDS during cornification (Serre et al.
  1991). It is stored and secreted by Lamellar bodies. After secretion CDSN localizes
  to the extracellular structures of CDS and covalently cross-links to the CE. This
  step coincides with the morphological transformation of DS into CDS. In vitro studies
  suggest that CDSN mediates homophilic binding to counterparts on adjacent corneocytes
  (Ishida-Yamamoto & Kishibe 2011). Cleavage of desmoglein, desmocollin and CDSN is
  a key step in desquamation.
