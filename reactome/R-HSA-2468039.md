display_name: Acetylation of SMC3 subunit of chromosomal arm associated cohesin by
  ESCO1 or ESCO2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Acetyltransferases ESCO1 and ESCO2 are homologs of the S. cerevisiae acetyltransferase
  Eco1, essential for viability in yeast. ESCO1 and ESCO2 share sequence homology
  in the C-terminal region, consisting of a H2C2 zinc finger motif and an acetyltransferase
  domain (Hou and Zou 2005). Both ESCO1 and ESCO2 acetylate the cohesin subunit SMC3
  on two lysine residues, K105 and K106 (Zhang et al. 2008), an important step in
  the establishment of sister-chromatid cohesion during the S-phase of the cell cycle.
  These dual acetylations on SMC3 are deacetylated by HDAC8 after the cohesin removal
  from chromatin for the dissociation and recycling of cohesin subunits (Deardorff
  et al. 2012). ESCO1 and ESCO2 differ in their N-termini, which are necessary for
  chromatin binding, and may perform distinct functions in sister chromatid cohesion
  (Hou and Zou 2005), as suggested by the study of Esco2 knockout mice (Whelan et
  al. 2012).
