display_name: Binding of ERCC1:ERCC4 (ERCC1:XPF) to pre-incision complex in GG-NER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ERCC1:ERCC4 (ERCC1:XPF) DNA endonuclease complex binds 5' to the DNA damage
  at global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) sites to form the incision
  complex. Binding of ERCC5 (XPG) to the NER site precedes the recruitment of ERCC1:ERCC4
  (Riedl et al. 2003). ERCC1 directly interacts with XPA, and this interaction is
  necessary for the loading of ERCC1:ERCC4 to the open bubble structure in damaged
  dsDNA and the progression of GG-NER (Tsodikov et al. 2007, Orelli et al. 2010).
