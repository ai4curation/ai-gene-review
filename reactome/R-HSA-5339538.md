display_name: MAGT1 transports Mg2+ from extracellular region to cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Magnesium (Mg2+) is required for the catalytic activity of numerous metalloenzymes
  within a variety of subcellular organelles. Magnesium transporter protein 1 (MAGT1)
  is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues and is upregulated by low Mg2+ concentrations.
  It is an essential protein in Mg2+ uptake into cells (Zhou & Clapham 2009, Goytain
  & Quamme 2005).
