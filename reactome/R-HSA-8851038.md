display_name: BTN3A1 binds prenylated phosphoantigens
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1) directly binds to small pyrophosphate containing
  organic molecules known as prenyl pyrophosphates or phosphoantigens (pAgs). These
  molecules are produced either endogenously, such as isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP),
  an intermediate of the mevalonate pathway in human cells that can accumulate intracellularly
  during tumorigenesis, or by microbes, such as hydroxy-methyl-butyl-pyrophosphate
  (HDMAPP, also known as HMBPP), a microbial intermediate of the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. This interaction causes a conformational change in the
  extracellular domain of BTN3A1, which then leads to the activation of a specialized
  subset of gamma/delta T cells Vgamma9Vdelta2. The other two members of the BTN3A
  family, BTN3A2 and BTN3A3 may also be involved in the activation process (Sandstrom
  et al. 2014).
