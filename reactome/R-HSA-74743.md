**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

Release of tyrosine-phosphorylated SHC from the insulin receptor triggers a cascade of signalling events via SOS, RAF and the MAP kinases (Sasaoka et al. 1996, Kleiman et al.2011).
This is a  black box event since this dissociation is inferred from other reaction which show association and dissociation for this protein under EGF stimulation (Kleiman et al. 2011).
