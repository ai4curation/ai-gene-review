display_name: VxPx cargo-targeting to cilium
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A number of membrane proteins destined for the ciliary membrane are recognized
  by ARF4 in the trans-Golgi network, initiating the formation of a ciliary targeting
  complex that directs the passage of these cargo to the cilium (Mazelova et al, 2009;
  Geng et al, 2006; Jenkins et al, 2006; Ward et al, 2011; reviewed in Deretic, 2013).
  Although there is some support for the presence of a VxPx or related motif in the
  C-terminal tail of cargo destined for ARF4-mediated transport to the cilium, the
  details of this  have not been definitively established and other ciliary targeting
  sequences have also been identified (reviewed in Deretic, 2013; Bhogaraju et al,
  2013).
