display_name: RGS proteins bind GNB5 and CCT/TRiC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'RGS proteins RGS7, RGS9 and, probably RGS6 and RGS11, bind to folded G-protein
  beta 5 subunit (GNB5) associated with the CCT/TRiC chaperonin. A RGS protein can
  associate with GNB5 and CCT/TRiC only after PDCL (PhLP1) is released as PDCL and
  RGS protein interact with overlapping regions of GNB5 (Howlett et al. 2009, Tracy
  et al. 2015). '
