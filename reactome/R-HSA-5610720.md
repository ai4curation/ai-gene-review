stable_id: R-HSA-5610720
display_name: PKA phosphorylates GLI3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation of GLI3 by PKA on up to six sites in the C-terminal region
  primes the protein for subsequent phosphorylation by CK1 and GSK3 and is required
  for the ubiquitin-mediated processing by the proteasome to yield the truncated repressor
  form (Tempe et al, 2006; Pan et al, 2006; Pan and Wang, 2007; Wang and Li, 2006).  Processing
  of GLI3 is regulated in part by movement through the primary cilia, and disruption
  of intraflagellar transport abrogates processing (Wen et al, 2010)
