summary: Ca(2+) flux across the phagosomal membrane influences NADPH oxidase activity
  and ROS production. Phagocytic engagement of Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) or complement
  receptor 3 (CR3) activate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K),
  leading to the formation of PI(3,4,5)P3. This phospholipid participates in the activation
  of phospholipase γ C (PLCγ) and phospholipase D (PLD)-mediated downstream signaling
  pathways. The generation of IP3 by PLCγ triggers Ca(2+) release from intracellular
  stores (endoplasmic reticulum, ER) via the opening of IP3 receptors (IP3-R). PLD
  is involved in the process of sphingosine kinase-produced sphingosine 1-phosphate
  (S1P), leading to the depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores. The emptying of
  intracellular Ca2+ stores induces the activation of the Ca(2+) sensor stromal interaction
  molecule-1 (STIM1), which, in turn, activates calcium release-activated calcium
  channel protein 1 (ORAI1) at the plasma membrane and extracellular Ca(2+) entry.
  The resulting elevation of Ca(2+) mediates the recruitment of the cytosolic Ca(2+)-activated
  regulators S100A8 (also know as migration inhibitory factor-related proteins 8 (MRP8))
  and S100A9 (MRP14) to the phagosomal membrane (Berthier S et al. 2003, 2012; Steinckwich
  N et al. 2011; Bréchard S et al. 2013). The translocation of S100A8:S100A9 allows
  the transfer of S100A9-binding arachidonic acid (AA) to cytochrome b558, favoring
  the conformational change of cytochrome b558 and promoting intraphagosomal NADPH
  oxidase activation and ROS production (Berthier S et al. 2003, 2012; Doussiere J
  et L. 2002; Kerkhoff C et al. 2005; Steinckwich N et al. 2011; Bréchard S et al.
  2013 ). S100A8 & S100A9 exist mainly as a S100A8:S100A9 heterodimer which is termed
  calprotectin based on its role in innate immunity (Korndorfer IP et al. 2007). Ca(2+)
  is also known to stimulate formation of higher order oligomers of S100 proteins,
  including S100A8/S100A9 tetramers (Leukert N et al. 2006; Korndörfer IP et al. 2007).
  In addition, calprotectin has been shown to inhibit bacterial growth through chelation
  of extracellular manganese Mn(2+), zinc Zn(2+) and possibly iron Fe(2+) and thus
  restricting metal-ion availability during infection (Damo SM et al. 2013; Hayden
  JA et al. 2013; Brophy MB et al. 2013; Gagnon DM et al. 2015).

## Summary

Ca(2+) flux across the phagosomal membrane influences NADPH oxidase activity and ROS production. Phagocytic engagement of Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) or complement receptor 3 (CR3) activate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to the formation of PI(3,4,5)P3.
