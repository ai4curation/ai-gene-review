display_name: Activation of DAkt1 by DPDK1
species: Drosophila melanogaster
summary: DPDK1 (a phosphoinositide-dependant protein kinase) controls cellular and
  organism growth through two effector pathways by activating DAkt and DS6K (S6 kinase).
  Phosphorylation of the residues Thr308 and Ser473 by DPDK1 (and another downstream
  kinase?) relieves intermolecular inhibition, allowing the activated DAkt to dissociate
  from PIP3 and modify its target, DFOXO.
