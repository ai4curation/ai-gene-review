display_name: p-STAT1 and p-STAT4 dissociate from IL12RB2:IL6ST receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta(STAT1) and
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4)  after phosphorylation
  dissociates from the complex of ligand receptor and will dimerize (Delgoffe & Vignali
  2013). This is a Black Box event because the mechanism of the release of STAT1 and
  STAT4 from the receptor complex is unclear. However, it is reported that simultaneous
  activation of IL12RB2 or IL6ST homodimer receptors do not promote the formation
  of pSTAT1:pSTAT4 and only the activation of the IL12RB2:IL6ST heteromeric receptor
  favours pSTAT1:pSTAT4 formation. For this reason, STAT1 and STAT4 are simultaneously
  considered in the binding, activation and release events.
