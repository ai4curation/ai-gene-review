summary: Several missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR2 have been
  identified in Crouzon syndrome and similar craniosynostosis disorders (Kan, 2002;
  Cunningham, 2007).  The N549H and K660N mutations are paralogous to FGFR3 N540K
  and K650N/E mutations identified in hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia
  II (Bellus, 2000).  In FGFR3, these mutations have been demonstrated to have weak
  ligand-independent autophosphorylation and enhanced kinase activity mediated by
  disruption of a hydrogen-bonding network that holds the receptor in an inactive
  conformation (Chen, 2007; Bellus, 2000, Raffioni, 1998).  Due to the highly conserved
  nature of these residues across all four FGF receptors, it is generally believed
  that these germline mutations in FGFR2 are also activating, though this remains
  to be demonstrated experimentally.<br><br><br>As further support of this notion,
  activating point mutations in the kinase domain of FGFR2 have also been identified
