display_name: MyrG-DCUN1D3 binds CRL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DCUN1D3 binds to CRL1 ligase complexes to antagonize their neddylation and
  activation.  DCUN1D3 is unique among the DCUN1D family members in that is N-terminally
  myristolyated, resulting in plasma membrane localization.  Binding of DCUN1D3 to
  CUL1-containing E3 ligase complexes sequesters the cullin complexes at the plasma
  membrane, inhibiting their DCUN1D1-mediated neddylation (Huang et al, 2014).  Although
  in this reaction DCUN1D3 is shown binding to cullin E3 ligases in complex with COMMD
  proteins and CCDC22, DCUN1D3 has also been shown to interact with CAND1 and the
  precise timing of this sequestration binding event remains to be clarified.
