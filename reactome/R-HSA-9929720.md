stable_id: R-HSA-9929720
display_name: CCNA:CDK1 phosphorylates OBI1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CCNA2 binds to OBI1 (also known as ORC ubiquitin ligase 1 or RNF219) in G2
  (Pagliuca et al. 2011) and the CCNA2:CDK1 complex phosphorylates OBI1 on CDK consensus
  site T719 (Pagliuca et al. 2011). OBI1 is involved in the regulation of origin firing
  during DNA replication (Coulombe et al. 2019).
