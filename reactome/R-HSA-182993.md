display_name: Ubiquitination of stimulated EGFR (CBL)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CBL down-regulates receptor tyrosine kinases by conjugating ubiquitin to
  them. This leads to receptor internalization and degradation. The ubiquitin protein
  ligase activity of CBL (abbreviated as E3 activity) is mediated by its RING finger
  domain. Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase kappa (PTPRK/RPTPk/DEP1) dephosphorylates
  EGFR, thereby inhibiting receptor ubiquitylation (Ub) by c-CBL, which decelerates
  the rate of receptor internalization and diminishes MAPK signals generated at the
  membrane and in endosomes. PTPRK disrupts physical association of ubiquitin ligase
  complex with EGFR and impairs its internalization (Tarcic et al. 2009, Xu et al.
  2005).
