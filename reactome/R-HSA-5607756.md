species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRAF6 possesses ubiquitin ligase activity and undergoes K-63-linked auto-ubiquitination
  after its oligomerization. In the first step, ubiquitin is activated by an E1 ubiquitin
  activating enzyme. The activated ubiquitin is transferred to a E2 conjugating enzyme
  (a heterodimer of proteins Ubc13 and Uev1A also known as TRIKA1 (TRAF6-regulated
  IKK activator 1)) forming the E2-Ub thioester. Finally, in the presence of ubiquitin-protein
  ligase E3 (TRAF6, a RING-domain E3), ubiquitin is attached to the target protein
  (TRAF6 on residue Lysine 124) through an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus
  of ubiquitin and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue in the target protein
  (Deng et al. 2000, Lamothe et al. 2007). In contrast to K-48-linked ubiquitination
  that leads to the proteosomal degradation of the target protein, K-63-linked polyubiquitin
  chains act as a scaffold to assemble protein kinase complexes and mediate their
  activation through proteosome-independent mechanisms. This K63 polyubiquitinated
  TRAF6 activates the TAK1 kinase complex.

## Summary

The activated ubiquitin is transferred to a E2 conjugating enzyme (a heterodimer of proteins Ubc13 and Uev1A also known as TRIKA1 (TRAF6-regulated IKK activator 1)) forming the E2-Ub thioester.
