stable_id: R-HSA-9614564
display_name: 14-3-3 proteins bind AKT-phosphorylated FOXO4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Nuclear exclusion and cytoplasmic retention of AKT-phosphorylated FOXO4 is
  promoted by binding of FOXO4 to 14-3-3 zeta (YWHAZ) (Obsilova et al. 2005, Boura
  et al. 2007, Silhan et al. 2009).
