species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-phosphate and PI
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate PI 3,4-bisphosphate and PI 3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3) and these second messengers recruit other signaling proteins containing plecstrin
  homology (PH) domain. PIP3 rapidly accumulates at sites of phagocytosis and disappears
  after the phagosome has been sealed off from the plasma membrane.
