display_name: GABA loaded synaptic vesicle Docking and Priming
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GABA loaded synaptic vesicles are docked at the presynaptic terminal membrane
  by a number of proteins including Rab3a, RIM (Rab3a interaction protein) and Munc
  13. The docked GABA vesicles are primed by the SNARE complex that includes synaptobrevin,
  SNAP 25 and syntaxin1.
