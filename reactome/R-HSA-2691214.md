display_name: NOTCH1 HD domain mutants bind JAG2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: It has not been directly demonstrated that JAG2 binds to and activates NOTCH1
  HD (heterodimerization) domain mutants, but NOTCH1 HD domain mutants are expected
  to respond to JAG2 like they respond to DLL1 (Malecki et al. 2006).
