display_name: Reduction of disulphide bonds in MHC II antigens
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MHC class II epitopes require protein denaturation and removal of intra-
  and inter-chain disulphide bonds prior to proteolysis. The lysosomal thiol reductase
  gamma-IFN-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) has been shown to facilitate
  MHC class II-restricted antigen (Ag) processing by breaking disulphide bonds. GILT
  is constitutively expressed in APCs. The reduction of disulphide bonds by mature
  GILT is optimal at acidic pH (Hastings et al. 2006, Arunachalam et al. 2000).
