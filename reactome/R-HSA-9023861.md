display_name: PRMT1 binds TBP:TFIIA:DDX5:ESR1:estrogen:TFF1 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PRMT1 is an H4 R3 methyltransferase that is recruited to the TFF promoter
  where, in conjunction with acetyltransferases, it establishes transcriptionally
  active chromatin (Métivier et al, 2003. CARM1 is an alternate arginine methyltransferase
  with activity toward H3 R17 that acts at the TFF enhancer, however CARM1 and PRMT1
  are never found simultaneously at the TFF1 gene (Métivier et al, 2003; reviewed
  in Xu et al, 2003; Arnal et al, 2017).Note that in this diagram, methylation of
  H4 R3 is not depicted.
