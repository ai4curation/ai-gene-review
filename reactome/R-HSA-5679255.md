summary: 'WIPI2 can bind ATG16L in the ATG12:ATG5:ATG16L complex (Dooley et al. 2014).
  Subsequently, LC3 is conjugated to PE. Other uncharacterised mechanisms are believed  to
  lead to the recruitment of the ATG16L1 complex at the point of autophagosome nucleation

## Summary

WIPI2 can bind ATG16L in the ATG12:ATG5:ATG16L complex (Dooley et al. 2014). Subsequently, LC3 is conjugated to PE. Other uncharacterised mechanisms are believed  to lead to the recruitment of the ATG16L1 complex at the point of autophagosome nucleation (Fujita et al. 2008, Carlsson & Simonsen 2015).
