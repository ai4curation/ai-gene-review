display_name: Fibronectin degradation by MMP14
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'MMP14 (MT1-MMP) can degrade fibronectin (Shi & Sottile 2011; Takino et al.
  2011).  Studies have shown that fibronectin turnover is not prevented by protease
  inhibitors (Sottile & Hocking 2002) and suggest that caveolin-1-mediated endocytosis
  and intracellular degradation are involved (Salicioni et al. 2002, Sottile & Chandler
  2004).

## Summary

MMP14 (MT1-MMP) can degrade fibronectin (Shi & Sottile 2011; Takino et al. 2011).  Studies have shown that fibronectin turnover is not prevented by protease inhibitors (Sottile & Hocking 2002) and suggest that caveolin-1-mediated endocytosis and intracellular degradation are involved (Salicioni et al. 2002, Sottile & Chandler 2004).
