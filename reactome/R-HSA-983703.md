stable_id: R-HSA-983703
display_name: p-6Y-SYK phosphorylates BLNK (SLP65)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BLNK (SLP-65, BASH) forms a stable complex with GRB2, SOS1, and CIN85 in
  the cytosol. The complex is recruited to the plasma membrane where activated (phosphorylated)
  SYK  phosphorylates BLNK at tyrosines 72, 84, 96, 178, and 189 (Fu et al. 1998,
  Chiu et al. 2002, inferred from mouse in Wienands et al. 1998, from chicken in Oellerich
  et al. 2009). Phosphorylated BLNK serves as a scaffold that binds effector molecules
  such as Phospholipase C. As inferred from mouse, BLNK interacts with phosphorylated
  tyrosines on CD79A (Ig-alpha) (Engels et al. 2001, Kabak et al. 2002).
