display_name: The ABCC family mediates organic anion transport
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The multidrug resistance associated protein (MRPs) subfamily of the ABC transporter
  family can transport a wide and diverse range of organic anions that can be endogenous
  compounds and xenobiotics and their metabolites. All human MRPs (except MRP9) can
  mediate these transport reactions (Deeley et al. 2006). Separately, specific reactions
  have also been annotated to describe the roles of ABCC4 in platelet dense granule
  assembly, of ABCC1 in LTC4 export (an aspect of leukotriene synthesis), and of ABCC3
  in bile salt efflux.
