## Summary

Interleukin-36 receptor antagonist protein (IL36RN, IL-36Ra) binds the interleukin-36 receptor subunit IL1RL2 (Interleukin-1 receptor-like 2, IL-1Rrp2). This inhibits the activity of interleukin-36 (IL36) by preventing IL1RL2 and IL1RAP from associating to form the interleukin-36 receptor complex (Towne et al. 2015). Similarly, Interleukin-1 family member 10 (IL1F10), also referred to as Interleukin-38, binds the interleukin-36 receptor subunit IL1RL2 inhibiting IL36 signaling (van de Veerdonk et al. 2012).  

Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in IL36RN have been identified to cause generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) (Onoufriadis et al. 2011, Marrakchi et al. 2011).
