display_name: Ubiquitination of p130 (RBL2) by SCF (Skp2)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: As quiescent G0 cells reenter the cell cycle, p130 (RBL2) is phosphorylated
  by CDK4/6. This phosphorylated p130 (RBL2) binds ubiquitin ligase SCF (Skp2) in
  complex with Cks1, and is subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded similarly to p27,
  which is another target of SCF (Skp2).
