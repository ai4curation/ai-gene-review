display_name: Digestion of diacylglycerols by extracellular PTL:colipase
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Pancreatic lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of extracellular dicylglycerols
  to yield monoacylglycerols and long-chain fatty acids. The enzyme is active only
  when complexed with colipase protein and plays a major role in the digestion of
  dietary diacylglycerols in the small intestine (Carriere et al. 2000; Giller et
  al. 1992).
