display_name: Formation of the Spliceosomal C complex containing intron lariat
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Spliceosomal B* complex and Spliceosomal C complex differ only in the
  structure of the pre-mRNA. Two magnesium ions coordinated by the U6 snRNA catalyze
  a transesterification reaction, the first reaction of splicing, converting the Spliceosomal
  B* complex into the Spliceosomal C complex by cleaving the 5' exon from the pre-mRNA
  and forming the intron lariat structure via a 5'-2' bond between the phosphate of
  the 5' residue of the intron and the 2' hydroxyl group of the adenosine residue
  of the intron branch point. The components of the Spliceosomal C complex have been
  ascertained using proteomic and structural methods (Jurica et al. 2002, Makarov
  et al. 2002, Rappsilber et al. 2002, Reichert et al. 2002, Bessonov et al. 2010,
  Agafonov et al. 2011, Schmidt et al. 2014, Zhan et al. 2018, Kastner et al. 2019).
