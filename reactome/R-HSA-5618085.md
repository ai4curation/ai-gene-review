summary: FKBP52 (also known as the large immunophilin FKBP4) is a co-chaperone containing
  tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which binds the C-terminal sequence motif
  (MEEVD) of HSP90 (Wu B et al. 2004; Davies and Sanchez 2005). The stoichiometry
  of FKBP in receptor heterocomplexes was determined on the basis of the size of cross-linked
  complexes, a ratio of one molecule of receptor and two molecules of HSP90 to one
  molecule of FKBP52 was obtained for human PR , ER  and mouse GR (Rexin M et al.
  1992; Rehberger P et al. 1992; Segnitz B and Gehring U 1995). Mass spectrometry
  analysis showed that FKBP51 (FKBP5) and FKBP52 (FKBP4) form analogous complexes
  with GR:HSP90:STIP1:HSP70:ATP (Ebong IO et al. 2016). Binding of FKBP52 (FKBP4)
  and other immunophilins may weaken the association of TPR domain containing protein
  STIP1 with HSP90 complex (Li et al. 2011).<p>FKBP52 (FKBP4) is a member of the immunophilin
  (IMM) protein family of intracellular proteins that are able to bind immunosuppressant
  drugs, from which the term immunophilin derives (Pratt and Toft 1997; Kang et al.
  2008). These proteins are also known as peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases)
  for their ability to convert proline bonds from cis to trans form, a rate-limiting
  step in protein folding (Harding et al. 1989; Standaert et al. 1990; Galat 2003;
  Davies and Sanchez 2005). In addition to the PPIase and TPR domains, there are two
  additional domains - the nucleotide-binding domain (also called FKBD2 in FKBP proteins)
  where ATP binds and the calmodulin-binding domain, a poorly characterized domain
  able to interact with calmodulin.
