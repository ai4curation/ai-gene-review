display_name: B3GALT6 transfers Gal to the tetrasaccharide linker
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 6 (B3GALT6) transfers a second galactose to
  the tetrasaccharide linker. Although it can act on substrates with a terminal beta-linked
  galactose residue, it prefers the sequence galactose-beta-1,4-xylose (Bai et al.
  2001). B3GALT6 requires manganese as a cofactor (Zhou et al. 1999).
