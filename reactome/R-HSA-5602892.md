display_name: Defective GCLC does not ligate L-Glu to L-Cys
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL) catalyses the first and rate-limiting
  step in GSH biosynthesis. GCL is a heterodimer of a catalytic heavy chain (GCLC)
  and a regulatory light chain (GCLM). Defects in the catalytic GCLC can cause hemolytic
  anemia due to gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency (HAGGSD; MIM:230450),
  a disease characterised by hemolytic anemia, glutathione deficiency, myopathy, late-onset
  spinocerebellar degeneration, and peripheral neuropathy. Mutations causing HAGGSD
  are H370L, P185L and R127C (Beutler et al. 1999, Ristoff et al. 2000, Hamilton et
  al. 2003).
