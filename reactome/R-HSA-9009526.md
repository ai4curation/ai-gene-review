display_name: 'CARM1 binds TBP:TFIIA:DDX5:ESR1:estrogen:TFF1 gene '
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CARM1 is an H3 R17 methyltransferase that is recruited to the TFF promoter
  where, in conjunction with acetyltransferases, it establishes transcriptionally
  active chromatin (Métivier et al, 2003; Chen et al, 2000; Daujat et al, 2002). PRMT1
  is an alternate arginine methyltransferase with activity toward H4 R3 that acts
  at the TFF enhancer, however CARM1 and PRMT1 are never found simultaneously at the
  TFF1 gene (Métivier et al, 2003; reviewed in Xu et al, 2003; Arnal et al, 2017).Note
  that in this diagram, methylation of H3 R17 is not depicted.
