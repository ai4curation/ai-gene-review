species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated AMPK (phosphorylated on Thr172 or Thr174 and AMP bound) phosphorylates
  RPTOR (Raptor) on Ser722 and Ser792. These phosphorylations are required for inhibition
  of mTORC1 activity in response to energy stress (Gwinn et al. 2008).

## Summary

Activated AMPK (phosphorylated on Thr172 or Thr174 and AMP bound) phosphorylates RPTOR (Raptor) on Ser722 and Ser792. These phosphorylations are required for inhibition of mTORC1 activity in response to energy stress (Gwinn et al. 2008).
