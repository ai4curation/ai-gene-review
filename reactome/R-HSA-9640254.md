display_name: BMT2 (SAMTOR) binds S-adenosylmethionine and dissociates from KICSTOR:GATOR1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BMT2 (SAMTOR) binds GATOR1 and acts upstream of GATOR1 and KICSTOR to inhibit
  mTORC1 activation (Gu et al. 2017). Upon binding S-adenosymethionine, a metabolic
  derivative of the amino acid methionine, SAMTOR dissociates from GATOR1 and mTORC1
  activity is increased through an uncharacterized mechanism (Gu et al. 2017). GATOR1
  is recruited to the lysosomal membrane by the KICSTOR complex (Wolfson et al. 2017).
