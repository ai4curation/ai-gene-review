display_name: Formation of the complex of PSMD3, PSMD6, and SEM1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Components of the proteasome 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) lid, PSMD3
  (ortholog of yeast Rpn3), PSMD6 (ortholog of yeast Rpn7) and SEM1 (ortholog of yeast
  Sem1, also known as Rpn15) bind to form the complex known as the Lid particle 3
  (LP3) (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). The existence of the lid subcomplex
  composed of PSMD3 (Rpn3), PSMD6 (Rpn7), and SEM1 (Rpn15) was confirmed in human
  embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T (Bai et al. 2019). SEM1 interacts directly with
  PSMD3 and is required for binding of PSMD3 to PSMD6 (Bai et al. 2019).
