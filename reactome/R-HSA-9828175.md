display_name: Formation of the NSL complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'WDR5 is a subunit of an evolutionarily conserved lysine acetyltransferase
  Non-Specific-Lethal (NSL) complex together with the following proteins: KAT8 (also
  known as MOF) as the catalytic subunit, KANSL1-3 (also known as NSL1-3), MCRS1,
  HCFC1 (also known as Host cell factor 1 or HCF1), and one of the paralogous proteins:
  PHF20 or PHF20-like 1 (PHF20L1) (Smith et al, 2005; Cai et al, 2010; Van et al 2022).
  The NSL complex is responsible for the acetylation of lysine K5, K8, K12, and K16
  of histone H4 (Smith et al, 2005; Cai et al, 2010; Zhao et al, 2013; Radzisheuskaya
  et al., 2021). The NSL complex binds to the promoters of house-keeping genes and
  regulates their expression (Radzisheuskaya et al., 2021), therefore in some contexts,
  it is essential for the viability and proliferation of human cells (Klein et al,
  2016; Radzisheuskaya et al., 2021).'
