display_name: TP53 stimulates NDRG1 gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Binding of TP53 (p53) to the NDRG1 gene promoter stimulates NDRG1 expression
  (Stein et al. 2004, Zhang et al. 2007). NDRG1 may positively regulate TP53-mediated
  apoptosis (Stein et al. 2004) or TP53-mediated cell cycle arrest (Zhang et al. 2007).
  The exact function of NDRG1 has not been elucidated. Most studies suggest that NDRG1
  has a tumor suppressive role, but there are conflicting reports, showing that NDRG1
  may act as an oncogene in some settings (reviewed by Liu et al. 2012, Sun and Cao
  2013).

## Summary

Binding of TP53 (p53) to the NDRG1 gene promoter stimulates NDRG1 expression (Stein et al. 2004, Zhang et al. 2007). NDRG1 may positively regulate TP53-mediated apoptosis (Stein et al. 2004) or TP53-mediated cell cycle arrest (Zhang et al. 2007). The exact function of NDRG1 has not been elucidated. Most studies suggest that NDRG1 has a tumor suppressive role, but there are conflicting reports, showing that NDRG1 may act as an oncogene in some settings (reviewed by Liu et al. 2012, Sun and Cao 2013).
