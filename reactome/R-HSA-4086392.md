display_name: PDE6 hydrolyses cGMP to GMP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: WNT signaling through WNT5A and FZD2 leads to a decrease in intracellular
  cGMP levels in a manner that is dependent on G alpha t2 and PDE6 (Ahumada et al,
  2002; Ma and Wang, 2006; Ma and Wang, 2007).  In response to decreasing cGMP levels,
  the activity of cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) also decreases, and this reduction
  in PKG activity is required both for intracellular calcium release and for activation
  of NFAT-dependent transcription in response to WNT5A (Ma and Wang, 2006).
