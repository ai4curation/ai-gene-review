stable_id: R-HSA-8983835
display_name: JAK1/JAK2/TYK2 bound to IL6ST:IL6ST phosphorylate STAT1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-35 (IL35) binding activates the IL35 receptor complex and facilitates
  Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK (JAK) phosphorylation. Subsequently, Signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (STAT1) binds to the receptor complex
  and is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (Collison et al. 2012). Although it
  is known that JAKs are involved in STATs phosphorylation (Stark GR and Darnell JE,
  2012), it is not clear how other components of the IL35 receptor complex contribute
  to STAT1 phosphorylation. For this reason, this event is assigned a black box status.
