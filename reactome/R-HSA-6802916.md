display_name: RAF is phosphorylated downstream of moderate kinase activity BRAF mutants
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Homo- or heterodimerization (with RAF1, also known as CRAF) downstream of
  moderate kinase activity BRAF mutants leads to phosphorylation and activation of
  the 'receiver' kinase.  Unlike the case for the highly active V600E BRAF mutation,
  pathway activation downstream of moderately activated BRAF mutants depends both
  on RAS binding and on dimerization (Wan et al, 2004; Roring et al, 2012; Freeman
  et al, 2013; reviewed in Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014; Lavoie and Therrien, 2015)<br><br>
