display_name: Activated MAP2Ks phosphorylate MAPKs downstream of oncogenic RAS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MAPK proteins are phosphorylated downstream of oncogenic RAS mutants; somewhat
  surprisingly, however, steady state levels of phospho-MAP2K and phospho-MAPKs are
  not always elevated in cancer cells (reviewed in Ramos, 2008; Neuzillet et al, 2014;
  Stephen et al, 2014).

## Summary

MAPK proteins are phosphorylated downstream of oncogenic RAS mutants; somewhat surprisingly, however, steady state levels of phospho-MAP2K and phospho-MAPKs are not always elevated in cancer cells (reviewed in Ramos, 2008; Neuzillet et al, 2014; Stephen et al, 2014).
