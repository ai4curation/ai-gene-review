display_name: Formation of the Flap Intermediate on the C-strand
species: Homo sapiens
summary: When the polymerase delta:PCNA complex reaches a downstream Okazaki fragment,
  strand displacement synthesis occurs. The primer containing 5'-terminus of the downstream
  Okazaki fragment is folded into a single-stranded flap (Podust et al. 1995, Bae
  et al. 2001, Maga et al. 2001). The helicase activity of either WRN (Werner syndrome
  protein) or BLM (Bloom syndrome helicase) is needed for DNA polymerase delta progression
  and strand displacement synthesis across G-rich telomeric repeats during lagging
  strand (C-strand) synthesis (Li et al. 2017).
