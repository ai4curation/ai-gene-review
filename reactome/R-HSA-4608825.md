display_name: DVL2 is phosphorylated after WNT5A binding to FZD
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DVL2 is phosphorylated upon WNT5A stimulation of HEK293 cells.  In human
  mammary carcinoma cells,  DVL2 has been shown to be constititutively bound to PARD6A,
  irrespective of WNT stimulation and DVL phosphorylation (Narimatsu et al, 2009).   PARD6A
  is a partitioning protein with known roles in the establishment of apico-basal polarity
  (reviewed in Chen and Zhang, 2013).  More recently, PARD6A and the SMURF ubiquitin
  ligases have been implicated in the PCP pathway, targeting the core PCP protein
  Prickle1 for degradation (Narimatsu et al, 2009).  WNT5A-dependent phosphorylation
  of DVL2 is required for the subsequent recruitment of SMURF1/2 ubiquitin ligases
  to the DVL2-PARD6A complex (Narimatsu et al, 2009)
