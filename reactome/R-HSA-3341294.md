stable_id: R-HSA-3341294
display_name: Superoxide reduces cytochrome c
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Superoxide can reduce cytochrome c in the intermembrane space (Wegerich et
  al. 2013, and inferred from other mammals in Butler et al. 1975, Koppenol et al.
  1976, Butler et al. 1982). Superoxide has been shown in rat and mouse mitochondria
  to be released into the intermembrane space by the complex III of the respiratory
  chain (Han et al. 2001, Muller et al. 2004).
