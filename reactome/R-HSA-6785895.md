display_name: Expression of IL4, IL13-upregulated extracellular proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In human peripheral blood monocytes IL4 and IL13 significantly upregulate
  the levels of several extracellular proteins involved in inflammatory resolution
  including fibronectin (FN1), coagulation factor XIII (FXIII), annexin 1 (ANXA1),
  collagen type 1 alpha 2 (COL1A2), laminin alpha-5 (LAMA5) and C-C motif chemokine
  22 (CCL22) (Chaitidis et al. 2005, Jinnin et al. 2004, Yakubenko et al. 2011).
