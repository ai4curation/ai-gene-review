display_name: HSF1 activation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a transcription factor that activates gene
  expression in response to a variety of stresses, including heat shock, oxidative
  stress, as well as inflammation and infection (Shamovsky I and Nudler E 2008; Akerfelt
  et al. 2010; Bjork and Sistonen 2010; Anckar and Sistonen 2011).<p>HSF1 is constitutively
  present in the cell. In the absence of stress HSF1 is found in both the cytoplasm
  and the nucleus as an inactive monomer (Sarge KD et al. 1993; Mercier PA et al.
  1999; Vujanac M et al. 2005). A physical or chemical proteotoxic stress rapidly
  induces HSF1 activation, which occurs through a multi?step process, involving HSF1
  monomer-to-homotrimer transition, nuclear accumulation, and binding to a promoter
  element, called the heat shock element (HSE), which leads to the increase in the
  stress-inducible gene expression (Sarge KD et al. 1993; Baler R et al. 1998; Sonna
  LA et al. 2002; Shamovsky I and Nudler E 2008; Sakurai H and Enoki Y 2010; Herbomel
  G et al. 2013). Depending on the type of stress stimulus, the multiple events associated
  with HSF1 activation might be affected differently (Holmberg CI et al 2000; Bjork
  and Sistonen 2010).
