display_name: Defective EXT2 (in EXT1:EXT2) does not transfer GlcA to heparan
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Exostosin 1 and 2 (EXT1 and 2) are dual-specific glycosyltransferases required
  to form heparan sulfate (HS) which is involved in regulating various body functions
  during development, homeostasis and pathology including blood clotting, angiogenesis
  and metastasis of cancer cells. They are able to transfer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)
  and glucuronate (GlcA) to HS during its synthesis. Defects in EXT2 cause exostoses
  2 (MIM:133701),  an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by multiple projections
  of bone capped by cartilage resulting in deformed legs, forearms and hands. Mutations
  causing exostoses 2 are V187Pfs*115, A361Pfs*44, D227N, G172*, Q258* and Y222* (Stickens
  et al. 1996, Wyuts et al. 1996, Philippe et al. 1997, Heinritz et al. 2009).
