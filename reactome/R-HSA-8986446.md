stable_id: R-HSA-8986446
display_name: IL26 binds IL20RA:JAK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin 26 is believed to bind to its receptor complex which is formed
  by Interleukin 20 receptor subunit alpha and JAK1 (Yoon et al. 2006, Yoon et al.
  2010, Sheikh et al. 2004). This is a black box event because constitutive pre association
  of JAK1 with IL20RA is inferred from the observation that IL20RA belongs to the
  cytokine receptor type II family, which has a common domain necessary for binding
  of JAK1 and release signaling (Ferrao et al. 2016, Hor et al. 2004).
