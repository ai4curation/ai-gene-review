display_name: Insertion of gp41 fusion peptide into the target membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Insertion of the N-terminal fusion peptide of the HIV gp41 protein is the
  first step in the fusion of viral and target cell membranes.  Substitutions of polar
  amino acids at residues 2, 9, 15 and 26 of the N terminus of this peptide completely
  eliminated its ability to cause fusion, implicating these residues in gp41’s role
  in insertion and fusion.  Studies have also shown that mutations in a stretch of
  residues from 36-64(568 to 596 of ENV protein) caused gp41 to become partially or
  completely defective in mediating membrane fusion, suggesting that conformation
  of the peptide is important for proper insertion and fusion to occur.
