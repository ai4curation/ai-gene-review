summary: A link between protein translation levels and MITF signaling is suggested
  by the role of the Lys tRNA synthetase, KARS (also called LysRS), in regulating
  MITF transcription factor by modulating the interaction of MITF with its HINT1 repressor
  protein (reviewed in Goding and Arnheiter, 2019)<br>KARS is part of a cytosolic
  complex called the multisynthetase complex (MSC) consisting of an additional 8 other
  amino-acyl tRNA synthetases and three non-enzymatic proteins (Bandyopadhyay and
  Deutscher, 1971). Upon KIT stimulation in melanoma cells, the KARS component is
  phosphorylated in a MAPK-dependent fashion at serine 207 (Razin et al, 1999; Yannay-Cohen
  et al, 2008; Ofir-Birin et al, 2013). This releases the KARS homodimer from the
  MSC, increasing the rate at which it synthesizes P(1),P(4)-bis(5'-adenosyl) tetraphosphate(4-)
  (AP4A) and allowing interaction of the KARS homodimer with MITF (Zamecnik et al,
  1966; Razin et al, 1999; Carmi-Levy et al, 2008; Yannay-Cohen et al, 2009). AP4A
  binds to the MITF repressor HINT1 and disrupts the MITF-HINT1 interaction, relieving
  repression and allowing activation of MITF-dependent targets (Lee et al, 2004; Carmi-Levy
  et al, 2008; Yannay-Cohen et al, 2008).
