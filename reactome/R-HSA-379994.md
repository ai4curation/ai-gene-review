stable_id: R-HSA-379994
display_name: methionine + tRNA(Met) + ATP => Met-tRNA(Met) + AMP + pyrophosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MARS (cytosolic methionyl tRNA synthetase) catalyzes the reaction of methionine,
  tRNA(Met), and ATP to form Met-tRNA(Met), AMP, and pyrophosphate. The enzyme, a
  class I tRNA synthetase, is a monomer found in the cell as a component of the mutienzyme
  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (Kaminska et al. 2001).
