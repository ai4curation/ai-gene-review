display_name: Formation of RTC (Reverse Transcription Complex)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Reverse transcription complex is a transitory structure where reverse transcription
  takes place.  Initially, it is likely identical to the RNA-protein complex found
  inside the virion core.  Upon maturation, it may shed some HIV proteins (such as
  MA or Vpr) and incorporate cellular proteins (such as INI1 or PML).
