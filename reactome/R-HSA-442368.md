display_name: SLC40A1:HEPH:6Cu2+ transports Fe2+ from cytosol to extracellular region
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The primary site for absorption of dietary iron is the duodenum. Ferrous
  iron (Fe2+) is taken up from the gut lumen across the apical membranes of enterocytes
  and released into the portal vein circulation across basolateral membranes.<br>The
  human gene SLC40A1 encodes the metal transporter protein MTP1 (aka ferroportin or
  IREG1). This protein resides on the basolateral membrane of enterocytes and mediates
  ferrous iron efflux into the portal vein (Schimanski et al. 2005). MTP1 colocalizes
  with hephaestin (HEPH) which stablizes MTP1 and is necessary for the efflux reaction
  to occur (Han & Kim 2007, Chen et al. 2009). As well as the dudenum, MTP1 is also
  highly expressed on macrophages (where it mediates iron efflux from the breakdown
  of haem) and the placenta (where it may mediate the transport of iron from maternal
  to foetal circulation). It is also expressed in muscle and spleen.
