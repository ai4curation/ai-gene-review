display_name: FGFR2 fusions dimerize
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FGFR2 fusions have been identified in a number of cancers, including breast,
  thyroid, lung and cholangiocarcinoma (Wu et al, 2013; Seo et al, 2012; Arai et al,
  2013; reviewed in Parker et al, 2014).  Many of the 3' fusion partners contain dimerization
  domains, suggesting the fusion proteins may dimerize contstitutively independent
  of ligand binding, although this has not been explicitly demonstrated in all cases
  (Wu et al, 2013; reviewed in Parker et al, 2014).
