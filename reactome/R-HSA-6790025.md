summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a key regulator
  of gene expression in response to signaling of many cytokines including interleukin-6
  (IL6), Oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Using microarray techniques,
  hundreds of genes have been reported as potential STAT3 target genes (Dauer et al.
  2005, Hsieh et al. 2005). Some of these genes have been proven to be direct STAT3
  targets using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation screening (Snyder et al.
  2008, Carpenter & Lo 2014), including the mitochondrial outer membrane protein genes  Apoptosis
