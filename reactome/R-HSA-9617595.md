display_name: SGTA binds mislocalized membrane protein
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Membrane proteins are not delivered to membranes with complete efficiency
  and a portion can end up mislocalized to the cytosol. SGTA binds the hydrophobic
  regions of such mislocalized proteins that are exposed to the cytosol (Leznicki
  and High 2012, Xu et al. 2012, Wunderly et al. 2014, Shao et al. 2017). Client proteins
  of SGTA include both tail-anchored proteins destined for insertion into the endoplasmic
  reticulum membrane (Leznicki et al. 2013) and inappropriately localized proteins
  such as cytosolic PRNP (PrP) (Leznicki and High 2012), which is normally located
  in the plasma membrane. Mislocalized proteins bound by SGTA can be routed to the
  proteasome via ubiquitination by the BAG6 complex (BAG6:GET4:UBL4A) (Shao et al.
  2017).
