species: Mus musculus
summary: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) associated with the activated receptor
  for Csf1, Csf1r (M-CSFR), phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  to yield phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (Reedijk et al. 1992, Lee
  and States 2000, Sampaio et al. 2011). The regulatory subunit of PI3K, PIK3R1, associates
  with phosphotyrosine-721 of Csf1r (Reedijk et al. 1992, Sampaio et al. 2011) and
  is important for proliferation, migration, and anti-inflammatory activity of macrophages
  (Munugalavadia et al. 2005, Sampaio et al. 2011, Yu et al. 2012, Caescu et al. 2015).
