display_name: Release of acetylcholine at the synapse
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once vesicles are docked, primed and ready to be released fusion of the synaptic
  vesicle with the plasma membrane can be triggered by an influx of Ca2+ through the
  voltage gated Ca2+ channels (N, P/Q, R, and L type). Ca2+ influx initiates a cascade
  of events in which the Ca2+ sensing protein, synaptotagmin-1 (sty-1) is central.
  Sty-1 promotes the membrane fusion between the synaptic vesicle and the plasma membrane
  by Ca2+ dependant induction of membrane curvature. Synaptotagmin competes with SNARE
  complex binding in a Ca2+ dependent manner thereby displacing complexin-1 and causing
  membrane curvature and fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane.
  The fusion is characterized by the formation of a trans SNARE complex in which SNAP
  25, syntaxin and synaptobrevin along with synaptotagmin, and Rab3a either become
  a part of the plasma membrane or membrane delimited in the vesicular membrane. Vesicle
  fusion ultimately results in the release of the acetylcholine into the synaptic
  cleft.
