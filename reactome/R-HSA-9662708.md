stable_id: R-HSA-9662708
display_name: CREB binds IL6 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The IL-6 promoter contains several transcription factor-responsive elements
  (Luo and Zheng 2016). CREB, a classical cAMP-inducible CRE-binding factor interacts
  with a region of the IL-6 promoter that is known as CRE-like sequence (Dendorfer
  et al. 1994). Moreover, IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by a wide variety
  of cells including macrophages, T cells, B cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells
  (Yang et al. 2014).
