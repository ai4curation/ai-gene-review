stable_id: R-HSA-2870221
display_name: E-selectin binds E-selectin ligand
species: Homo sapiens
summary: E-selectin is an adhesion molecule on the cell surface of endothelial cells.
  It participates in the binding of leukocytes to activated blood vascular endothelium
  during inflammation or metastasis (Haraldsen G et al. 1996). Leucocytes express  E-selectin
  ligand 1 (ESL-1) and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PCGL-1) which were identified
  as the ligands for E-selectin (Graves BJ et al 1994; Asa D et al 1995). E-selectin
  has been also implicated in mediating tissue-specific homing primitive hematopoietic
  progenitor cells (HPCs) into bone marrow (BM). PCGL-1, CD43, CD44 were shown to
  function as E-selectin ligands on human BM cells (Dimitroff CJ et al. 2001; Katayama
  Y et al. 2003; Merzaban JS et al. 2011).
