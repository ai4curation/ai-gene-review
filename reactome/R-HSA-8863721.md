display_name: NEDD8-STON binds TOR1 hexamer and COP9 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STON2 protein levels are stabilized by deneddylation, restoring the endocytic
  uptake of SYT1.  Deneddylation is mediated by TOR1A and the CSN4 subunit of the
  COP9 signalosome, both of which directly bind to STON2 (Granata et al, 2011).
