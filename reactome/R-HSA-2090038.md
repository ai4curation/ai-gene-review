display_name: NAGLU hydrolyses heparan chain(2)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) also hydrolyses another non-reducing,
  terminal N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue from heparan sulfate. The active form of
  the enzyme (77kDa) is derived from an 82kDa precursor (Weber et al. 1996). Defects
  in NAGLU cause Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPSIIIB, MIM:252920), also known
  as Sanfilippo syndrome type B (Beesley et al. 2005).
