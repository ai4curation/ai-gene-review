display_name: RAD51 binds BRCA2 at resected DNA DSBs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BRCA2 and RAD51 interact directly through the highly conserved BRC repeats
  in BRCA2 (Venkitaraman 2002). CHEK1-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA2 (at threonine
  residue T3387) and RAD51 (at threonine residue T309) modulates their binding (Sorensen
  et al. 2005, Bahassi et al. 2008). One BRCA2 can bind up to six RAD51 molecules,
  thus playing an important role in RAD51 nucleation at the dsDNA-ssDNA junction created
  by resection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Liu et al. 2010, Thorslund et al.
  2010, Jensen et al. 2010). After the nucleation step, additional RAD51 molecules
  bind the ssDNA and multimerize, forming RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments (Yang et al.
  2005). BRCA2-mediated RAD51 loading displaces the RPA complex from 3' overhanging
  ssDNA at DSBs (Liu et al. 2010, Jensen et al. 2010), possibly with other RPA-bound
  proteins, such as ATR:ATRIP and complexes involved in ATR catalytic activation.<br><br>BRCA2-binding
  partner SEM1 (DSS1) directly facilitates RPA release from ssDNA and its replacement
  with RAD51 (Zhao et al. 2015).<br><br>The interaction with DNA is critical for BRCA2
  function, and the protein contains two different DNA binding regions. The amino-terminal
  DNA-binding domain (NTD) (residue 267-350) consists of a zinc finger-poly(adenosine
  diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-like domain and binds to different DNA structures
  (ssDNA, dsDNA, tailed DNA, and gapped DNA) with similar affinity (von Nicolai et
  al. 2016). The carboxy-terminal DNA-binding domain CTD (residue 2,474-3,190) is
  significantly more complex with three OB-folds and an apical 3 bundle helix on top
  of a tower domain preceded by a helical domain (Yang et al. 2002). The proposed
  breast and ovarian cancer cluster regions (BCCR and OCCR) overlap with the CTD (Rebbeck
  et al. 2015, Gayther et al. 1997). Several common pathogenic mutations (ClinVar
  database) and loss-of-function mutations are found in this region including K2630A,
  K2630D, D2723H.
