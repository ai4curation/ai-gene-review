species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Nidogen-1 (entactin) is a member of the nidogen family of basement membrane
  glycoproteins. It  interacts with several other components of basement membranes,
  notably it connects the collagen and laminin networks to each other (Yurchenko &
  Patton 2009). MMPs 3, 7 (Mayer et al. 1993), 1, 9, (Sires et al. 1993), 12 (Gronski
  et al. 1997), 14, 15 (d''Ortho et al. 1997), 19 (Stracke et al. 2000) and leukocyte
  elastase (Mayer et al. 1993) can all degrade Nidogen-1. '

## Summary

Nidogen-1 (entactin) is a member of the nidogen family of basement membrane glycoproteins. It  interacts with several other components of basement membranes, notably it connects the collagen and laminin networks to each other (Yurchenko & Patton 2009). MMPs 3, 7 (Mayer et al. 1993), 1, 9, (Sires et al. 1993), 12 (Gronski et al. 1997), 14, 15 (d'Ortho et al. 1997), 19 (Stracke et al. 2000) and leukocyte elastase (Mayer et al. 1993) can all degrade Nidogen-1.
