display_name: Desaturation of dihomo-gamma-lenolenoyl-CoA to arachidonoyl-CoA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DGL-CoA (8,11,14-eicosatrienoyl-CoA) undergoes desaturation by delta 5-desaturase
  (D5-desaturase) forming arachidonoyl-CoA (AA-CoA, 5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoic acid).
  D5-desaturase has 62% sequence identity with D6-desaturase but desaturates a different
  carbon atom, adding a double bond at position C5 in arachidonoyl-CoA (AA-CoA). AA
  can be metabolized by variety of oxygenases (including cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase
  systems) to form a family of varying products known as eicosanoids, prostaglandins,
  leukotrines and thromboxanes thus playing important role in inflamation response.
