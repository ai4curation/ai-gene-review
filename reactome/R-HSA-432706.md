display_name: trans-Golgi Network Lysosome Vesicle Destined Membrane Coat Assembly
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once the basic components of the docking complex are assembled with one end
  of AP-1 bound to cargo molecules, the other end binds to clathrin. Clathrin triskelions
  polymerize into hexagons and pentagons, forming a cage, which leads to membrane
  deformation. This polymerization step drives the sculpting of the lysosome vesicle.
  Here only 5 clathrin triskelions are represented, though in reality many more would
  be involved in sculpting an entire vesicle.
