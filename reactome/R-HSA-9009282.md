stable_id: R-HSA-9009282
display_name: CDK1 phosphorylates RUNX2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RUNX2, presumably in complex with CBFB, can be phosphorylated by the complex
  of CDK1 and cyclin B. The interaction was demonstrated between endogenous human
  RUNX2 and CDK1:CCNB1. It was also shown in human cells that RUNX2 undergoes CDK1:CCNB1-mediated
  phosphorylation on serine residue S451 of RUNX2-P2 isoform. This residue corresponds
  to the mouse Runx-P1 serine residue S472 (Qiao et al. 2006, Rajgopal et al. 2007).
  At mitotic exit, RUNX2 is dephosphorylated by unidentified PP1 or PP2A phosphatase
  (Rajgopal et al. 2007).
