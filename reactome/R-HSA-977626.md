stable_id: R-HSA-977626
display_name: C4b-binding protein binds C4b
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The most abundant form of C4b-binding protein (C4BP) consists of seven alpha-chains
  (70kDa) and one beta-chain (45kDa) all linked by disulphide bonds to form a native
  protein with a molecular weight of 570kDa (Hilarp et al. 1989). Each alpha chain
  can bind C4b; it is not known whether full occupancy is necessary for subsequent
  events. The beta chain binds and inactivates Protein S, a component of the coagulation
  system. C4BP down-regulates complement activity in several ways: It binds to C4b
  thus inhibiting the formation of the classical pathway C3 convertase C4bC2a; it
  acts as a decay accelerating factor for existing convertases, probably by promoting
  dissociation of C2a; it is a cofactor in Factor I mediated C4b proteolysis.'
