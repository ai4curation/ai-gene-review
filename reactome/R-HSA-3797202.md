display_name: AP-1 stimulates transcription of IGFBP7
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FOS:JUN (AP-1) transcription factor stimulates the transcription of IGFBP7
  gene. IGFBP7 is a component of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
  and is secreted by senescent melanocytes in which the senescence is induced by the
  expression of oncogenic BRAF V600E. The BRAF V600E-mediated induction of IGFBP7
  expression is AP-1 dependent. The conditioned medium harvested from BRAF V600E senescent
  melanocytes is able to inhibit cellular proliferation and induce senescence of naive
  melanocytes only when IGFBP7 is present in the medium (Wajapeyee et al. 2008).
