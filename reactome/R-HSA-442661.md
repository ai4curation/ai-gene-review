stable_id: R-HSA-442661
display_name: SLC41A1,2 transport Mg2+ from extracellular region to cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Magnesium (Mg2+) is an abundant cation that is important for many intracellular
  biochemical functions, especially as a cofactor for ATP. Intracellular Mg2+ concentrations
  must be finely regulated and recently, transporters for this cation have been elucidated.
  The human genes SLC41A1 and SLC41A2 encode magnesium transport proteins 1 and 2
  respectively (MagT1 and MagT2). They both mediate the uptake of Mg2+ into cells
  (Goytain A and Quamme GA, 2005; Sahni J et al, 2007). A third human gene, SLC41A3,
  is also thought to encode a MagT protein but has not been characterized yet.
