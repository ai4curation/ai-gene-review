stable_id: R-HSA-5607733
display_name: BCL10 binds CARD9
species: Homo sapiens
summary: B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) is the downstream signaling partner of
  CARD9 and it interacts selectively with the CARD activation domain of CARD9. BCL10
  functions as an adaptor between the effector IKK complex and the proximal signaling
  complexes that interact with CARD9 (Bertin et al. 2000).
