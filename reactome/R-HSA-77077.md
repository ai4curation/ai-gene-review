species: Homo sapiens
summary: The capping enzyme binds the 5'-end of the nascent transcript soon after
  it is synthesized on the DNA template, and results in the formation of the capping
  complex along with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, and Spt5 (Heidemann
  et al. 2013, Buratowski 2009, Schoenberg and Maquat 2009).
