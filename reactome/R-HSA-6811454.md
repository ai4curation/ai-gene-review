display_name: MAPKs phosphorylate PP2A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated MAPK1 (ERK2) or MAPK3 (ERK1), recruited to the PP2A complex through
  IER3 (IEX-1), phosphorylate the regulatory subunit PPP2R5B (B56-beta) or PPP2R5C
  (B56-gamma) of the PP2A complex on serine residue S368 or S337, respectively. ERK-mediated
  phosphorylation of the PP2A regulatory subunits causes dissociation of the PP2A
  complex and prevents PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of AKT1 (Letourneux et al.
  2006, Rocher et al. 2007).
