display_name: ERBB2 ECD mutants heterodimerize with EGFR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ERBB2 extracellular domain (ECD) mutants harbor missense mutations that lead
  to substitutions of amino acid residues in the heterodimerization arm contact surface,
  involved in formation of ERBB2 heterodimers. The functionally studied ERBB2 ECD
  mutants, ERBB2 G309A (Bose et al. 2013), ERBB2 G309E (Greulich et al. 2012) and
  ERBB2 S310F (Greulich et al. 2012) seem to preferntially heterodimerize with EGFR.
  Heterodimerization of ERBB2 G309E involves formation of disulfide bonds (Greulich
  et al. 2012).
