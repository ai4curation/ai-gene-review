stable_id: R-HSA-5672957
display_name: PP2A dephosphorylates KSR1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon growth factor stimulation, KSR1 is dephosphorylated at S406 by PP2A,
  disrupting 14-3-3 binding and promoting membrane translocation of KSR1 (Ory et al,
  2003; Muller et al, 2001; reviewed in Raabe and Raap, 2003).
