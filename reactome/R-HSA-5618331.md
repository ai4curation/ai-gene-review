display_name: HDAC6 deacetylates microtubules
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HDAC6 is a microtubule-associated deacetylase that targets the K40 acetyl
  groups of alpha-tubulin (Hubbert et al, 2002; Loktev et al, 2008; Zhang et al, 2008).
  HDAC6 also interacts with BBIP1, a component of the BBSome that is required for
  BBSome assembly, and additionally (and independently of its role in the BBSome)
  plays a role in microtubule polymerization and acetylation (Loktev et al, 2008).
  Depletion of BBIP1 causes a marked reduction in cytoplasmic microtubule acetylation,
  and this defect is partially overcome by inhibition of HDAC6. These data suggest
  that BBIP1 may exert its effect on microtubule acetylation by negatively regulating
  HDAC6, although other mechanisms are also possible (Loktev et al, 2008).

## Summary

HDAC6 also interacts with BBIP1, a component of the BBSome that is required for BBSome assembly, and additionally (and independently of its role in the BBSome) plays a role in microtubule polymerization and acetylation (Loktev et al, 2008). Depletion of BBIP1 causes a marked reduction in cytoplasmic microtubule acetylation, and this defect is partially overcome by inhibition of HDAC6. These data suggest that BBIP1 may exert its effect on microtubule acetylation by negatively regulating HDAC6, although other mechanisms are also possible (Loktev et al, 2008).
