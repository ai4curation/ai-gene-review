## Summary

Apoptosis is governed by two pathways that ultimately lead to cell death. The extrinsic pathway is activated in response to external signalling proteins and is tightly regulated by the Bcl-2 superfamily of proteins. For a cell in its resting state, BCL family members, acting as suppressors, bind to effectors and activators of apoptosis to suppress their activity. One of the hallmarks of cancer is to evade apoptosis. Changes in the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 is a hallmark of B-cell lymphoma.
