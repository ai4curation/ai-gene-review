display_name: CTLA4 gene expression is stimulated by FOXP3 and inhibited by RUNX1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Binding of the RUNX1:CBFB complex to the promoter of the CTLA4 gene inhibits
  CTLA4 transcription. Once FOXP3 is associated with RUNX1, the CTLA4 gene transcription
  is stimulated. High cells surface level of CTLA4 is one of the hallmarks of regulatory
  T cells (T regs) (Ono et al. 2007). It is probable that FOXP3 acts as part of a
  complex with NFATC2 (Wu et al. 2006). '

## Summary

Binding of the RUNX1:CBFB complex to the promoter of the CTLA4 gene inhibits CTLA4 transcription. Once FOXP3 is associated with RUNX1, the CTLA4 gene transcription is stimulated. High cells surface level of CTLA4 is one of the hallmarks of regulatory T cells (T regs) (Ono et al. 2007). It is probable that FOXP3 acts as part of a complex with NFATC2 (Wu et al. 2006).
