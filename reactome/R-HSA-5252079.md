display_name: HSP110s exchange ATP for ADP on HSP70s:ADP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The substrate binding ability of heat-shock 70kDa proteins (HSP70s) is dependant
  on their bound state to either ATP or ADP. Release of a protein substrate is induced
  when HSP70s are bound to ATP and conversely, proteins substrates bind when HSP70s
  are bound to ADP. Intrinsic ATPase of HSP70s slowly hydrolyses ATP to ADP. This
  process can be speeded up by cochaperones such as HSP40s which stimulate ATPase
  activity. Nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) regulate the lifespan of the HSP70:ADP:substrate
  complex by exchanging ADP for ATP, thus inducing the release of the substrate. Eukaryote
  NEFs include heat-shock protein 105kDa (HSPH1 aka HSP110) (Schuermann et al. 2008)
  and the BAG family molecular chaperone regulator (BAG) family (BAG1-5). BAGs inhibit
  the chaperone activity of HSP70s by promoting substrate release (Takayama et al.
  1997, Takayama et al. 1999). HSC70-interacting protein (ST13 aka HIP) is a 48kDa
  tetrameric protein able to bind the ATPase domain of HSP70s and thought to stabilise
  the ADP state of HSP70s (Hohfeld et al. 1995, Prapapanich et al. 1996).
