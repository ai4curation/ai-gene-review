stable_id: R-HSA-5682690
display_name: ATG10 dissociates from ATG12:ATG5
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATG12 is transferred from ATG10, becoming conjugated to the target protein
  ATG5 at Lys-149 through an isopeptide bond (Mizushima et al. 1998). There is no
  E3-like enzyme involved in Atg12-Atg5 conjugation. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments,
  mutational analyses, and crosslinking experiments showed that ATG10 directly recognizes
  ATG5, binding it to place the side chain of ATG5 Lys-145 into an optimal orientation
  for its conjugation reaction with ATG12, thereby enabling ATG10 to mediate the formation
  of the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate without a specific E3 enzyme (Yamaguchi et al. 2012).
