stable_id: R-HSA-2179387
display_name: Mature HBEGF binds to EGFR, triggering dimerisation and autophosphorylation
  of the receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The heparin-binding EGF growth factor (HBEGF) is a member of the EGF family
  of growth factors that binds to and activates the EGF receptor EGFR/ErbB1 and ErbB4
  (not shown here) (Higashiyama et al. 1991, Elenius et al. 1997). The details which
  describe receptor dimerisation on ligand binding and autophosphorylation from experiments
  in mice have been omitted here.
