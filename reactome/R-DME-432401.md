stable_id: R-DME-432401
display_name: JET binds cytosolic TIM, facilitating its ubiquitination
species: Drosophila melanogaster
summary: There is competition for binding to the E3 ligase protein Jetlag (JET) from
  both Timeless (TIM) and cryptochrome (CRY), with TIM being the stronger binder.  The
  initial complex formed between CRY and TIM helps promote the interaction between
  the F-box domain containing protein JET with TIM.  This interaction targets TIM
  for ubiquitination, marking it for processing by the 26S proteasome.
