display_name: The Interleukin 1 receptor complex binds Tollip
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) binds to IRAK1 and IL-1RAP within the receptor
  complex. TOLLIP has the capacity to act as an ubiquitin-binding receptor for ubiquitinated
  IL1R1, linking IL1R to endosomal degradation.
