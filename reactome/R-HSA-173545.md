display_name: Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the SMAD complex terminates TGF-beta
  signaling
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The nuclear R-SMAD:Co-SMAD complex recruits ubiquitin conjugating enzymes,
  such as UBE2D1 and UBE2D3, that ubiquitinate the complex and eventually lead to
  its proteasomal degradation. This provides an end point to the signaling pathway.

## Summary

The nuclear R-SMAD:Co-SMAD complex recruits ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, such as UBE2D1 and UBE2D3, that ubiquitinate the complex and eventually lead to its proteasomal degradation. This provides an end point to the signaling pathway.
