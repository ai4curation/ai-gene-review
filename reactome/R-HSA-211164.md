stable_id: R-HSA-211164
display_name: AKT phosphorylates FOXO1A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: One or more of the isoforms of AKT catalyzes the phosphorylation of FOXO1A
  protein at three sites, threonine-24, serine-256, and serine-319 (Zhang et al. 2002,
  2006). This reaction occurs in the nucleoplasm, and thus is dependent on the phosphorylation
  and nuclear import of AKT in response to upstream regulatory factors (Burgering
  and Kops 2002).
