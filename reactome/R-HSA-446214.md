summary: Dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferase (ALG5) associated with the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) membrane catalyzes the reaction of cytosolic UDP-glucose with dolichyl
  phosphate exposed on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane to form Dolichyl-P-glucose
  with its glucose moiety oriented toward the cytosol (Imbach T et al, 1999).

## Summary

Dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferase (ALG5) associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane catalyzes the reaction of cytosolic UDP-glucose with dolichyl phosphate exposed on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane to form Dolichyl-P-glucose with its glucose moiety oriented toward the cytosol (Imbach T et al, 1999).
