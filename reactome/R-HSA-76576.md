## Summary

Formation of  phosphodiester bonds nine and ten creates RNA products, which do not dissociate from the RNA pol II initiation complex.  The transcription complex has enter the productive elongation phase. TFIIH and ATP-hydrolysis are required for efficient promoter escape.  The open region (“transcription bubble”) expands concomitant with the site of RNA-extension. The region upstream from the transcription start site (-9 to -3) collapses to the double-stranded state. TFIIH remains associated to the RNA pol II initiation complex.
