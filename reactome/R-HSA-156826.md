display_name: Dissociation of L13a from the 60s ribosomal subunit
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The L13a subunit of the 60s ribosome is phosphorylated about 16 hours after
  INF gamma induction by an unknown kinase.  At this time, L13a is also released from
  the 60s subunit (Mazumder et al.,2003). It is unclear, however, whether phosphorylation
  occurs before or after the release of L13a. Here, phosphorylation is shown  as occurring
  after release.
