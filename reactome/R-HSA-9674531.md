display_name: AAMP binds EGFR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'AAMP (Angio-associated migratory cell protein) binds to EGFR. The interaction
  involves the intracellular domain of EGFR. AAMP binding, through an unknown mechanism,
  promotes EGFR dimerization, trans-autophosphorylation and downstream signaling,
  leading to activation of ERKs (MAPK1 and MAPK3) and expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1).
  Downregulation of AAMP inhibits proliferation of a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
  cell line and increases its sensitivity to EGFR-targeted chemotherapeutic drugs,
  and it also inhibits tumorigenesis in a mouse model (Yao et al. 2019).<br>In addition
  to lung cancer, AAMP overexpression is linked with poor prognosis in breast cancer,
  where AAMP level positively correlates with tumor grade. AAMP is overexpressed in
  breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with necrosis (Adeyinka et al. 2002).  '
