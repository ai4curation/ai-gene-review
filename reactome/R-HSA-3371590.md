species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The human HSP70 family comprises at least eight unique gene products that
  differ from each other by amino acid sequence, expression level and sub-cellular
  localization (Daugaard M et al. 2007). HSP70 family members display highly conserved
  amino acid sequences and domain structures consisting of: the ATPase N-terminal
  domain that binds and hydrolyzes ATP (NBD), the substrate domain (SBD) that binds
  to exposed hydrophobic segments of client polypeptides and promote their solubility
  and/or folding in a dynamic ATP-dependent manner, and the C-domain that provides
  a “lid” for the substrate domain (Zhang P et al. 2014; Brocchieri L et al. 2008;
  Wisniewska M et al. 2010). The conserved domain structure consolidates the chaperone
  function of the Hsp70 proteins and enables them to bind and release extended stretches
  of hydrophobic amino acids, exposed by incorrectly folded globular proteins in an
  ATP-dependent manner (Takayama S et al. 1999; Mayer MP 2013; Daugaard M et al. 2007).
  The initial binding of an unfolded client protein by a heat shock protein 40 (HSP40)
  prevents its aggregation and ''delivers'' it to HSP70. The substrate binding ability
  of HSP70 is dependent on its bound state to either ATP or ADP (Kityk R et al. 2012;
  Qi R et al. 2013). Client substrates enter the HSP70 functional cycle by binding
  the ATP form of the chaperone, which has lower substrate affinity but faster binding
  and release rates compared with the ADP state. Interaction of the client in the
  cleft results in conformational changes in NBD that modestly increase ATP hydrolysis.
  Second, a transient interaction of HSP70 with J-protein co-chaperone HSP40, which
  has a higher affinity to ATP-bound HSP70 than ADP-bound HSP70, also stimulates the
  ATPase activity of HSP70 (Wittung-Stafshede P et al. 2003).'
