stable_id: R-HSA-8950780
display_name: p-Y705-STAT3 binds p-Y693-STAT4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-23 (IL23) signaling predominantly leads to formation of Signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) homodimers while also heterodimers
  of STAT3 and STAT4 can also be formed (Parham et al. 2002). The STAT4 phosphorylation
  induced by IL23 is much weaker than induced in response to Interleukin-12.

## Summary

Interleukin-23 (IL23) signaling predominantly leads to formation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) homodimers while also heterodimers of STAT3 and STAT4 can also be formed (Parham et al. 2002). The STAT4 phosphorylation induced by IL23 is much weaker than induced in response to Interleukin-12.
