display_name: Endorepellin binds alpha2beta1 integrin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Endorepellin is the C-terminal domain V of perlecan, constituting amino acids
  3687–4391 (Mongiat et al. 2004). It has anti-angiogenic properties, blocking endothelial
  cell adhesion to fibronectin and type I collagen (Mongiat et al. 2003). Endorepellin
  and a smaller fragement constituting the third laminin G–like (LG) domain (LG3)
  disrupts actin stress fibers and focal adhesions via an interaction with the collagen
  receptor alpha2beta1 integrin (Bix et al. 2004). Laminin G domains 1 and 2 of endorepellin
  bind specifically and with high affinity to Ig domains 3–5 of VEGFR2 (Willis et
  al. 2013).
