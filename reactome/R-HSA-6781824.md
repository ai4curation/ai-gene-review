summary: 'An active RNA polymerase II complex (RNA Pol II, POLR2) transcribes a damaged
  DNA template. Once damaged DNA bases, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs),
  enter the active site of the polymerase, RNA Pol II misincorporates a ribonucleotide
  into nascent mRNA, which blocks the translocation step and results in polymerase
  stalling. In the stalled complex, the lesion is inaccessible, while the RNA Pol
  II conformation is unchanged (Brueckner et al. 2007).  '

## Summary

An active RNA polymerase II complex (RNA Pol II, POLR2) transcribes a damaged DNA template. Once damaged DNA bases, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), enter the active site of the polymerase, RNA Pol II misincorporates a ribonucleotide into nascent mRNA, which blocks the translocation step and results in polymerase stalling. In the stalled complex, the lesion is inaccessible, while the RNA Pol II conformation is unchanged (Brueckner et al. 2007).
