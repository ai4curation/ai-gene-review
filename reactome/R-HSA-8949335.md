display_name: RUNX3:CBFB binds the ITGAL gene,(ITGA4 gene) promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'RUNX3, presumably in complex with CBFB, binds the RUNX response element
  in the promoter of the ITGAL (CD11a) gene, encoding leukocyte integrin involved
  in transendothelial migration of leukocytes during immune and inflammatory responses
  as well as co-stimulation of T cells (Puig-Kroger et al. 2003, Dominguez-Soto et
  al. 2005). RUNX3, as well as RUNX1, may also be involved in regulation of integrin
  alpha 4 (ITGA4, also known as CD49d) expression. A RUNX binding site exists in the
  ITGA4 promoter, but the direct binding of RUNX transcription factors has not been
  demonstrated (Domniguez-Soto et al. 2005). '

## Summary

RUNX3, presumably in complex with CBFB, binds the RUNX response element in the promoter of the ITGAL (CD11a) gene, encoding leukocyte integrin involved in transendothelial migration of leukocytes during immune and inflammatory responses as well as co-stimulation of T cells (Puig-Kroger et al. 2003, Dominguez-Soto et al. 2005). RUNX3, as well as RUNX1, may also be involved in regulation of integrin alpha 4 (ITGA4, also known as CD49d) expression. A RUNX binding site exists in the ITGA4 promoter, but the direct binding of RUNX transcription factors has not been demonstrated (Domniguez-Soto et al. 2005).
