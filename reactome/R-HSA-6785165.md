## Summary

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A or 5B (STAT5A and/or STAT5B, typically referred to as STAT5) are phosphorylated after Interleukin‑7 (IL7) ligand‑receptor interaction (Foxwell et al. 1995, van der Plas et al. 1996, Yu et al. 1998, Jufrroy et al. 2010, Landires et al. 2011).

Interleukin-7 (IL7)-activated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A or 5B (typically referred to as STAT5) translocates to the nucleus (Landires et al. 2011) and is recruited rapidly to the promoters of IL7-regulated genes (Ye et al. 2001, Stanton & Brodeur 2005).

This is a black box event because dissociation is inferred from the subsequent translocation of STAT5 to the nucleus.
