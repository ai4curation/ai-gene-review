display_name: OTUD7B,TNFAIP3 deubiquitinate TRAF6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: OTUD7D (Cezanne) negatively regulates the non-canonical NFkappaB pathway
  by removing Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains from TRAF6, preventing TRAF6 proteolysis,
  which causes over-activation of non-canonical NFkappaB and negative regulation of
  B-cell responses (Evans et al. 2001).<br><br>TNFAIP3 has the opposite effect, it
  can remove K63-linked ubiquitin from TRAF6, which terminates signalling by Toll-like
  receptors (Boone et al. 2004). TNFAIP3 is essential for the termination of NFkappaB
  activation in response to multiple stimuli such as IL-1beta, TNF, IL-6, CD40 and
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Vereecke et al. 2009).
