stable_id: R-HSA-2168897
display_name: LRP1 (CD91) binds Hemopexin:heme
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Once formed in the plasma, the hemopexin:heme complex is rapidly cleared
  from circulation and it is taken up by the liver (Smith and Morgan 1984, Smith and
  Morgan 1985, Tolosano et al. 2010, Vinchi et al. 2008), where heme is degraded by
  heme oxygenases. In mouse, rat and rabbit several experimental evidences led to
  the postulation of a specific receptor on hepatocytes with high affinity for the
  hemopexin:heme complex (Smith and  Morgan 1981, Smith and  Morgan 1984, Smith et
  al, 1988, Smith et al., 1991), but such a receptor has not been identified to date.
  The only known hemopexin:heme receptor is LRP1 (CD91) that is ubiquitously expressed
  and has a low affinity for the complex. LRP1 is a multi-ligand scavenger receptor,
  involved in endocytosis in some cells types, for example macrophages, and in signaling
  in other cell types (reviewed in Boucher and Herz 2011). LRP1 is known to act in
  the metabolism of lipoprotein and it is expressed in several cell types including
  macrophages, hepatocytes and neurons. Among several ligands, LRP1 (CD91) can bind
  the hemopexin:heme complex (Hvidberg et al. 2005). '
