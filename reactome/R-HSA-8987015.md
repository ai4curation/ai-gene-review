display_name: IL20 binds IL20RA:JAK1:IL20RB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-20 (IL20) binds a heterodimeric receptor complex that consists
  of Interleukin-20 receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA), which is associated with Tyrosine-protein
  kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and Interleukin-20 receptor subunit beta (IL20RB) (Blumberg et
  al. 2001, Parrish-Novak et al. 2002, Logsdon et al. 2012, Rutz et al. 2014). Interleukin-20
  receptor A (IL20RA) and Interleukin-20 receptor B (IL20RB) form a receptor complex
  for Interleukin-20 (IL20),  Interleukin-19 (IL19) and Interleukin-24 (IL24) (Blumberg
  et al. 2001,  Parrish-Novak et al. 2002, Logsdon et al. 2012, Rutz et al. 2014).
  IL20 can also bind a receptor complex that consists of Interleukin-22 receptor subunit
  alpha-1 (IL22RA1) and IL20RB (Kolumam et al. 2017). As it is not clear whether the
  dimeric receptor can form in the absence of ligand, formation of the receptor dimer
  is represented here as an uncertain black box event.
