display_name: POLN binds ICL-DNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: An error-prone DNA polymerase nu (POLN) is recruited to the interstrand crosslink
  (ICL) repair site through interaction with monoubiquitinated FANCD2 and probably
  the PCNA subunit of the stalled replication complex (Moldovan et al. 2010).
