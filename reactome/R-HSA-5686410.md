display_name: BLM mediates dissolution of double Holliday junction
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The BTRR complex, composed of BLM, TOP3A, RMI1 and RMI2, dissolves double
  Holliday junctions by disentangling hemicatenane intermediates (Bocquet et al. 2014).
  This results in non-crossover products, where no exchange of genetic material happens
  between the sister chromatid that served as a template for the DNA repair synthesis
  and the repaired DNA duplex. SPIDR serves as a scaffold that connects the BTRR complex
  with the double Holliday junction through its simultaneous interaction with RAD51-coated
  DNA strands of the Holliday junction and BLM. SPIDR is needed for BTRR-mediated
  prevention of cross-over between sister chromatids (Wan et al. 2013). The complex
  of FIGNL1 and FIRRM is recruited to DNA damage foci through interaction of FIGNL1
  with RAD51 (Yan and Chen 2013, Fernandes et al. 2018) and SPIDR (Yuan and Chen 2013).
  FIGNL1 and FIRRM inhibit formation of cross-overs during repair of DNA double strand
  breaks, which is consistent with the role of SPIDR (Fernandes et al. 2013).

## Summary

The BTRR complex, composed of BLM, TOP3A, RMI1 and RMI2, dissolves double Holliday junctions by disentangling hemicatenane intermediates (Bocquet et al. 2014).

SPIDR is needed for BTRR-mediated prevention of cross-over between sister chromatids (Wan et al. 2013).
