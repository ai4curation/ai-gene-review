stable_id: R-SCE-9633480
display_name: GCN2 phosphorylates SUI2
species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
summary: GCN2 phosphorylates SUI2 (eIF-2 alpha subunit) on serine-52 in response to
  amino acid starvation (serine-51 in the rabbit homolog, Dever et al. 1992, Ramirez
  et al. 1992, Marton et al. 1993, Wek et al. 1995, Yang et al. 2000, Garriz et al.
  2009, Zaborske et al. 2009). GCN1 is required for phosphorylation of SUI2 by GCN2
  (Marton et al. 1993). The phosphorylation affects reinitiation of translation and
  causes downregulation of translation of most mRNAs, however translation of certain
  mRNAs possessing upstream ORFs, such as GCN4, is upregulated (Dever et al. 1992).
