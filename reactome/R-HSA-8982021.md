display_name: G alpha (z) in G alpha (z):RGS complex is inactivated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) sense extracellular signals and activate
  different Guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). Upon activation, GPCRs
  can replace the GDP with GTP in the alpha subunit of G proteins. GTP binding modifies
  the conformation of G alpha proteins and activates them. The Regulator of G protein
  Signalling (RGS) are GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs) that can directly inhibit
  the G alpha subunit activity. There are at least 25 different types of RGS proteins
  known. RGS16, RGS17 and RGS20 can bind and stabilize the transition state of Guanine
  nucleotide binding protein G(z) subunit alpha (GNAZ). Following this, RGS exerts
  its GAP activity on GNAZ and facilitates the hydrolyses GTP to GDP.  This inactivates
  GNAZ and terminates downstream signalling (Neubig & Siderovski 2002, Kach et al.
  2012, Goto K et al. 2017). GNAZ inhibits adenylyl cyclase and interacts with Rap1GAP
  to attenuate Rap1 signaling.
