display_name: NOC2L binds TP53
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NOC2L (NIR) is an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferases that associates
  with TP53 (p53). NOC2L binding represses TP53-mediated transcriptional activation
  at TP53 target genes. One possible mechanism is the prevention of activating histone
  acetylation at TP53 target genes (Hublitz et al. 2005).
