summary: 'FAD-linked mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD2, alias:
  mGPDH) and its NAD-linked  cytosolic isoform (GPD1, alias:cGPDH) constitute glycerol
  phosphate shuttle.  GPD2 catalyzes the unidirectional conversion of glycerol-3-phosphate
  (G-3-P) to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) with concomitant reduction of the enzyme-bound
  FAD. Impaired activity of GPD2 has been suggested to be one of the primary causes
  of insulin secretory defects in beta-cells and thus it is a candidate gene for type

## Summary

FAD-linked mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD2, alias: mGPDH) and its NAD-linked  cytosolic isoform (GPD1, alias:cGPDH) constitute glycerol phosphate shuttle.  GPD2 catalyzes the unidirectional conversion of glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) with concomitant reduction of the enzyme-bound FAD. Impaired activity of GPD2 has been suggested to be one of the primary causes of insulin secretory defects in beta-cells and thus it is a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes.
