stable_id: R-HSA-182990
display_name: Sprouty sequesters CBL away from active EGFR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Sprouty can constitutively interact with two SH3 domains of CIN85 whereas
  the third SH3 domain of CIN85 can still associate with CBL on cell activation with
  EGF. This allows Sprouty to block CIN85-mediated clustering of CBL molecules, stablization
  of CBL-EGFR interactions and efficient ubiquitination and down-regulation of EGFR.

## Summary

Sprouty can constitutively interact with two SH3 domains of CIN85 whereas the third SH3 domain of CIN85 can still associate with CBL on cell activation with EGF. This allows Sprouty to block CIN85-mediated clustering of CBL molecules, stablization of CBL-EGFR interactions and efficient ubiquitination and down-regulation of EGFR.
