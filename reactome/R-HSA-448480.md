stable_id: R-HSA-448480
display_name: IL22 binds IL22RA1:JAK1 receptor complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Temporal models suggest that the first event in IL22 receptor formation is
  binding of Interleukin-22 (IL22) to IL22RA1), which pre associates with JAK1 (Li
  et al. 2004, Jones et al. 2008, Xie et al. 2000, Xu et al. 2001).<br>The Interleukin-22
  receptor consists of IL22RA1 and Interleukin-10 receptor subunit beta (IL10RB),
  which is also a component of the receptors for Interleukin-10 (IL10), Interleukin-22
  (IL22), Interleukin-26 (IL26), Interleukin-28 (IL28), and Interferon lambda-1 (IFNL1).
