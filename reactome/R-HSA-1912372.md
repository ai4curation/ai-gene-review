display_name: Fringe-modified Pre-NOTCH is cleaved by FURIN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Cleavage of fringe-modified NOTCH by FURIN has not been examined directly,
  but since mature, plasma membrane-anchored NOTCH receptors are typically cleaved
  by FURIN (Blaumueller et al. 1997) and fringe-modified NOTCH functions at the cell
  surface (Moloney et al. 2000), it is expected that fringe-modified NOTCH is processed
  by FURIN cleavage. The exact order of fringe-mediated glycosylation and FURIN cleavage
  has not been experimentally established, but since FURIN localizes to the trans-Golgi
  network -TGN (Teuchert et al. 1999), while fringe has not been associated with TGN,
  it is likely that modification of NOTCH by fringe enzymes precedes FURIN-mediated
  cleavage. '
