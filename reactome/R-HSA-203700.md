display_name: eNOS translocation from Golgi to Caveolae
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Palymitoylated, myristoylated eNOS forms a dimer and is transported from
  the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Transport is thought to be mediated by intracellular
  vesicles, but the details remain unknown (Govers & Rabelink 2001; Oess et al. 2006).
