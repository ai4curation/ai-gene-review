display_name: APAF1 binds AVEN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The binding of AVEN to apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1) is
  thought to interfere with the ability of APAF1 to self-associate during apoptosome
  assembly (Chau BN et al. 2000). The anti-apoptotic function of AVEN may require
  the proteolytic removal of the inhibitory N-terminus of AVEN (Melzer IM et al. 2012).

## Summary

The binding of AVEN to apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1) is thought to interfere with the ability of APAF1 to self-associate during apoptosome assembly (Chau BN et al. 2000). The anti-apoptotic function of AVEN may require the proteolytic removal of the inhibitory N-terminus of AVEN (Melzer IM et al. 2012).
