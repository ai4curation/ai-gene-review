stable_id: R-HSA-3700981
display_name: TP53 family members bind the BAX promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TP53 (p53) binds the p53 response element in the promoter of the BAX gene
  (Miyashita and Reed 1995). TP53 family members TP63 (p63) and TP73 (p73) can also
  bind the BAX promoter. Complex formation between ASPP proteins PPP1R13B (ASPP1)
  or TP53BP2 (ASPP2) and p53 family members TP53 (Samuels-Lev et al. 2001), TP63 or
  TP73 (Bergamaschi et al. 2004) enhances binding of p53 family members to the BAX
  promoter.
