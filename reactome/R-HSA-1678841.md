display_name: Regulation of protein ISGylation by ISG15 deconjugating enzyme USP18
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Ubiquitin specific protease 18 (USP18/UBP43) is the major ISG15 deconjugating
  enzyme. It removes ISG15 from ISGylated proteins. ISG15-specific protease activity
  of this enzyme is crucial for proper cellular balance of ISG15-conjugated proteins.
  However, it is not required for processing pre-ISG15 to the mature form. Furthermore,
  USP18 inhibits type I interferon signaling independent of its ISG15 deconjugating
  enzyme activity. Several viral proteins were also reported with de-ISGylation activity.
