display_name: Non-covalent tyrosine kinase inhibitors bind and inactivate sensitive
  ligand-responsive EGFR cancer mutants
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Non-covalent (reversible) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), erlotinib, gefitinib,
  lapatinib and vandetanib, selectively inhibit EGFR-stimulated tumor cell growth
  by blocking EGFR mutant autophosphorylation through competitive inhibition of ATP
  binding to the kinase domain. A number of EGFR kinase domain mutants and extracellular
  domain point mutants show increased senistivity to non-covalent TKIs compared with
  the wild-type EGFR. EGFR kinase domain mutants may be resistant to non-covalent
  TKIs due to primary or secondary mutations in the kinase domain that increase the
  affinity of the kinase domain for ATP, such as small insertions within exon 20,
  and substituion of threonine 790 with methionine (T790M).

## Summary

Non-covalent (reversible) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib and vandetanib, selectively inhibit EGFR-stimulated tumor cell growth by blocking EGFR mutant autophosphorylation through competitive inhibition of ATP binding to the kinase domain. A number of EGFR kinase domain mutants and extracellular domain point mutants show increased senistivity to non-covalent TKIs compared with the wild-type EGFR. EGFR kinase domain mutants may be resistant to non-covalent TKIs due to primary or secondary mutations in the kinase domain that increase the affinity of the kinase domain for ATP, such as small insertions within exon 20, and substituion of threonine 790 with methionine (T790M).
