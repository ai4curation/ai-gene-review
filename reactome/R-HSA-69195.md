display_name: Phosphorylation of Cyclin E:CDK2 complexes by WEE1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: WEE1 phosphorylates CDK2, inhibiting entry into S-phase (Watanabe et al.,
  1995; Wu et al., 2001). WEE1-mediated phosphorylation of CDK2 is enhanced in the
  presence of CABLES1, which can form a complex with CDK2 bound to cyclin E (CCNE)
  or cyclin A (CCNA) (Wu et al. 2001).
