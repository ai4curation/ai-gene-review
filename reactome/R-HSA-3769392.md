stable_id: R-HSA-3769392
display_name: YWHAZ and XPO1 mediate the nuclear export of beta-catenin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 14-3-3/YWHAZ and XPO1 both contribute to the CBY1-mediated nuclear export
  of beta-catenin (Li et al, 2008; Li et al, 2010).  The fate of the tripartite beta-catenin:CBY1:14-3-3/YWHAZ
  complex in the cytoplasm is unknown, although it may represent a reservoir of beta-catenin
  available for further signaling.  CBY1 may remain associated with 14-3-3/YWHAZ in
  the cytoplasm, as 14-3-3/YWHAZ binding inhibits binding of alpha-importin to CBY1
  (Li et al, 2010) . This suggests the presence of a phosphatase that dephosphorylates
  S20 on CBY1 to allow binding with alpha-importin and reimport into the nucleus.
