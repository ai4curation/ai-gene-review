summary: 'During PINK1:PRKN-mediated mitophagy, the autophagy receptor optineurin
  (OPTN) forms a complex with the autophagy-related 9A (ATG9A) protein, a membrane-spanning
  protein that is recruited to the autophagosomal formation site (Yamamoto H et al.,
  2012; Yamano K et al., 2020). ATG9A localizes to the cytoplasmic single-membrane
  vesicles, termed ATG9 vesicles (Yamamoto H et al., 2012). OPTN recruits cytoplasmic
  ATG9A vesicles to damaged mitochondria (Yamano K et al., 2020), where these vesicles
  provide membrane contact sites delivering proteins and lipids during autophagosome
  formation (Yamamoto H et al., 2012; reviewed by Nishimura T & Tooze SA 2020). The
  leucine zipper domain of OPTN is required for the interaction with ATG9A (Yamano
  K et al., 2020). Disruptions of OPTN:ATG9A interaction inhibits mitophagy (Yamano
  K et al., 2020). Interactions between OPTN and other ATG proteins such as microtubule-associated
  proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (MAP1LC3B or LC3) are implicated in autophagy. '

## Summary

During PINK1:PRKN-mediated mitophagy, the autophagy receptor optineurin (OPTN) forms a complex with the autophagy-related 9A (ATG9A) protein, a membrane-spanning protein that is recruited to the autophagosomal formation site (Yamamoto H et al., 2012; Yamano K et al., 2020). ATG9A localizes to the cytoplasmic single-membrane vesicles, termed ATG9 vesicles (Yamamoto H et al., 2012). OPTN recruits cytoplasmic ATG9A vesicles to damaged mitochondria (Yamano K et al., 2020), where these vesicles provide membrane contact sites delivering proteins and lipids during autophagosome formation (Yamamoto H et al., 2012; reviewed by Nishimura T & Tooze SA 2020). The leucine zipper domain of OPTN is required for the interaction with ATG9A (Yamano K et al., 2020). Disruptions of OPTN:ATG9A interaction inhibits mitophagy (Yamano K et al., 2020). Interactions between OPTN and other ATG proteins such as microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (MAP1LC3B or LC3) are implicated in autophagy.
