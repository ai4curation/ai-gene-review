stable_id: R-HSA-379893
display_name: isoleucine + tRNA(Ile) + ATP => Ile-tRNA(Ile) + AMP + pyrophosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IARS (cytosolic aspartyl tRNA synthetase) catalyzes the reaction of isoleucine,
  tRNA(Ile), and ATP to form Ile-tRNA(Ile), AMP, and pyrophosphate. The enzyme, a
  class I tRNA synthetase, is found in the cell as a component of the mutienzyme aminoacyl-tRNA
  synthetase complex (Shiba et al. 1994).
