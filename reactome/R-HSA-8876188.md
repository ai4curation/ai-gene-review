display_name: DENND4s exchange GTP for GDP on RAB10
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAB10 has well characterized roles in basolateral sorting and GLUT4 transport
  and has more recently been shown to contribute to ER dynamics and morphology (Chen
  et al, 1993; Babbey et al, 2006; Schuck et al, 2007; Sano et al, 2008; Chen et al,
  2012; Chen and Lippincott-Schwarz, 2013; English and Voeltz, 2013).  In vitro, DENN4
  family members A, B and C show RAB10-specific GEF activity, and DENN4B staining
  colocalizes with that of RAB10 in HeLa cells (Yoshimura et al, 2010). Consistent
  with this, coexpression of DENND4C and RAB10 in HEK293 cells increases the fraction
  of GTP-bound RAB10, and DENND4C knockdown in insulin-stimulated 3T3 cells reduces
  the trafficking of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (Sano et al, 2011). Interaction
  of RAB10:GDP with its GEFs promotes release of GDP, allowing GTP to bind, and precludes
  the interaction of RAB10 with GDI and CHM proteins.

## Summary

RAB10 has well characterized roles in basolateral sorting and GLUT4 transport and has more recently been shown to contribute to ER dynamics and morphology (Chen et al, 1993; Babbey et al, 2006; Schuck et al, 2007; Sano et al, 2008; Chen et al, 2012; Chen and Lippincott-Schwarz, 2013; English and Voeltz, 2013).  In vitro, DENN4 family members A, B and C show RAB10-specific GEF activity, and DENN4B staining colocalizes with that of RAB10 in HeLa cells (Yoshimura et al, 2010). Consistent with this, coexpression of DENND4C and RAB10 in HEK293 cells increases the fraction of GTP-bound RAB10, and DENND4C knockdown in insulin-stimulated 3T3 cells reduces the trafficking of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (Sano et al, 2011).
