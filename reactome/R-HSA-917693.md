stable_id: R-HSA-917693
display_name: ESCRT Disassembly
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Disassembly Phase <br>

  The AAA-ATPase, Vps4 disassembles ESCRT-III and catalyzes the final step of the
  MVB pathway. The microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain of Vps4 interacts
  directly with the C-terminal region of Vps2 (MIM1) and Vps20 (MIM2). The association
  of Vta1, which contains two MIT domains, greatly enhances the activity of Vps4.
  Please note that the recomended names of the Vacuolar protein sorting-associated
  proteins (Vps) are Charged multivesicular body proteins or CHMPs.'
