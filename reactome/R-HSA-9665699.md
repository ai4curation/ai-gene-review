display_name: Phosphorylated heterodimers of ERBB2 TMD/JMD mutants recruit GRB2:SOS1
  through SHC1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activation of downstream RAS signaling was shown for ERBB2 S653C (de Martino
  et al. 2014) and ERBB2 R678Q (Bose et al. 2013, de Martino et al. 2014) through
  activating tyrosine phosphorylation on ERKs (MAPK1 and MAPK3) and SHC1. It is assumed
  that heterodimers of ERBB2 TMD/JMD mutants, like the wild type ERBB2 heterodimers,
  bind to and phosphorylate SHC1, leading to the recruitment of the GRB2:SOS1 complex.
