display_name: Lyn activates ERK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The activation of Lyn by GHR is thought to indirectly activate ERK. Mutations
  of GHR predicted to disable a conformational change brought about by GH binding
  impaired ERK signaling but not JAK2/STAT5 signaling. ERK signaling was demonstrated
  to involve the Src family kinase Lyn (Rowlinson et al. 2008) and suggested to involve
  Src kinase dependent activation of Phospholipase C gamma and thereby Ras, similar
  to a mechanism proposed  by Bivona et al. (2003). ERK activation mechanisms involving
  Src kinases and PLCgamma have been reported for the erythropoietin, thrombopoietin
  and prolactin receptors (Brooks & Waters 2010).
