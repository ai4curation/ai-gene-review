display_name: Cargo of PEX5S,L translocates from the cytosol to the peroxisomal matrix
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After binding the Docking and Translocation Module comprising PEX14, PEX13,
  PEX2, PEX10 and PEX12 , PEX5S or PEX5L bound to a cargo protein becomes localized
  to the membrane (Dodt et al. 1995, Wiemer et al. 1995, Alencastre et al. 2009, Francisco
  et al. 2013, Dias et al. 2017). In a reaction that is not yet fully characterized,
  the cargo protein is released into the peroxisomal matrix while PEX5S or PEX5L remains
  in the membrane (Dodt et al. 1995, Wiemer et al. 1995, Alencastre et al. 2009, Franscisco
  et al. 2013). One model for the reaction hypothesizes that PEX13:PEX14 (associated
  with PEX2:PEX10:PEX12) forms a barrel in the peroxisomal membrane while PEX5S or
  PEX5L acts as a plunger to guide the cargo through the barrel (Dias et al. 2017,
  Francisco et al. 2017). Notably, the reaction does not require a source of energy
  such as ATP (Oliveira et al. 2003). Mutations in PEX5 cause defects in import of
  PTS1-containing proteins or PTS2-containing proteins or both (Eberrink et al. 2009,
  Barøy et al. 2015).
