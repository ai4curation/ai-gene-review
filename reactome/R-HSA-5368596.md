stable_id: R-HSA-5368596
display_name: WNT3A stimulates the caveolin-dependent internalization of FZD5:p-LRP6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After stimulation by WNT3A, FZD5 and phosphorylated LRP6 are internalized
  from lipid rafts in a caveolin- and RAB5-dependent manner (Yamamoto et al, 2006;
  Yamamoto et al, 2008).   Recruitment of CAV1 to the activated receptor complex inhibits
  the binding of beta-catenin to AXIN in the destruction complex, resulting in the
  accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin and the induction of WNT-dependent signaling
  (Yamamoto et al, 2006; Yamamoto et al, 2008).
