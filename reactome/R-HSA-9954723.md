display_name: NEDD8-K699-CUL2:ELOB:ELOC:RBX1:KLHDC10 binds alanine-tailed nascent
  peptide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The CRL2-KLHDC10 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (NEDD8-K699-CUL2:ELOB:ELOC:RBX1:KLHDC10)
  binds C-terminal alanine residues that have been polymerized ("CAT-tailed") by NEMF
  onto a nascent peptide from a 60S ribosomal subunit that has been dissociated from
  a stalled 80S ribosome (Thrun et al. 2021, Patil et al. 2023). Substrates of the
  CRL2-KLHDC10 complex also include C-termini containing alanine-glycine, tryptophan-glycine,
  and proline glycine (Koren et al. 2018). The mechanism by which the nascent peptide
  is cleaved from the peptidyl-tRNA and extracted from the 60S ribosomal subunit is
  uncharacterized.
