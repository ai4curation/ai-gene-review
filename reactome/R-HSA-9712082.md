summary: IRS1 is phosphorylated downstream of NPM-ALK fusions (Fujimoto et al, 1996).
  ALK-dependent IRS phosphorylation activates the MAP kinase signaling pathway and

# ALK fusions phosphorylate IRS1
**Reactome ID:** [R-HSA-9712082](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-9712082)
**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

IRS1 is phosphorylated downstream of NPM-ALK fusions (Fujimoto et al, 1996). ALK-dependent IRS phosphorylation activates the MAP kinase signaling pathway and promotes cellular proliferation, but direct binding of a RAS GEF such as GRB2:SOS1 has not been shown (reviewed in Chiarle et al, 2008; Roskoski, 2013).
