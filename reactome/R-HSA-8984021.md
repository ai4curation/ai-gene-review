stable_id: R-HSA-8984021
display_name: STAT1,STAT3 associate with IL27RA:IL12RB2 receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin 35 (IL35) binding activates the IL35 receptor complex and facilitates
  JAKs phosphorylation. Subsequently, Signal transducer and activator of transcription
  1 alpha/beta (STAT1) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 alpha/beta
  (STAT3) bind to the receptor complex and are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation
  (Wang et al. 2014). This is a black box event because the receptor subunit responsible
  for STAT1 and STAT3 binding to the receptor is unclear.
