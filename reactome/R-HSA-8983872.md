stable_id: R-HSA-8983872
display_name: JAK2 bound to IL12RB2:IL12RB2 phosphorylate STAT4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin 35 (IL35) binding activates the IL35 receptor complex and may
  facilitate Tyrosine protein kinase JAK (JAK) phosphorylation. Subsequently, Signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 4 alpha/beta (STAT4) may bind to the receptor
  complex and is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (Collison et al. 2012). JAK2
  is known to be involved in the phosphorylation of STAT1 (Higashi T et al., 2005).
