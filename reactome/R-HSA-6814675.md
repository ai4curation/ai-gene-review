display_name: RAB9 binds RHOBTB3, bringing late endosome-derived vesicles to the TGN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Retrograde traffic of mannose-6-phosphate receptors (M6PRs) from the late
  endosome depends on RAB9 (Lombardi et al, 1993; Riederer et al, 1994; Barbero et
  al, 2002; reviewed in Pfeffer, 2011).  Cargo recognition at the late endosome is
  mediated by the RAB9-interacting protein PLIN3/TIP47, which concentrates retrograde
  cargo into VAMP3 RAB9 positive vesicles (Diaz et al, 1998; Carroll et al, 2001;
  Reddy et al, 2006; Ganley et al, 2008).  RABEPK is another RAB9:GTP interacting
  protein that is required for retrograde transport of M6PR to the TGN (Diaz et al,
  1997). At the trans-Golgi network, RAB9 and PILN3 interact with the atypical RHO
  GTPase related protein RHOBTB3.  This interaction is required for the TGN-localization
  of RAB9 M6PR positive vesicles.  Interaction of RAB9 with the C-terminal domain
  of RHOBTB3 relieves an inhibitory intramolecular interaction in RHOBTB3, allowing
  the N-terminal domain to achieve maximal ATP hydrolysis, which is thought to promote
  the release of PLIN3/TIP47 as a precursor to vesicle fusion at the TGN (Espinosa
  et al, 2009)
