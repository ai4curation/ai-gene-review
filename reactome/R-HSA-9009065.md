summary: Estrogen induces cellular proliferation by upregulating expression of critical
  cell cycle regulators that govern progression through G1, such as Myc and Cyclin
  D1 (reviewed in Butt et al, 2005).  In the absence of estrogen, Cyclin D1 expression
  is inhibited, at least in part, by the binding of a transcriptional repressor complex
  YY1:HDAC1 to the promoter (Cicatiello et al, 2004). Estrogen-stimulated induction
  of target gene expression appears in many cases to be primed by the binding of 'pioneer'
  transcription factors, such as FOXA and GATA family proteins (Carroll et al, 2005;
  Laganière et al, 2005; Eeckhoute et al, 2006;  Hurtado et al, 2011; Kong et al,
  2011; Theodorou et al, 2013; Swinstead et al, 2016; reviewed in Zaret and Carroll,
  2011; Augello et al, 2011; Fiorito et al, 2013; Wilson and Giguere, 2008). FOXA
  factors have a winged helix structure that is thought to bind to closed chromatin
  structures in a manner analogous to linker histones, displacing linker histones
  and rendering the DNA more accessible to other transcription factors (reviewed in
  Zaret and Carroll, 2011). FOXA binding sites tend to be enriched at enhancer elements,
  characterized by H3K4 mono- and dimethylation, and expression of the histone demethylase
  KDM1A abrogates FOXA recruitment (Lupien et al, 2008). An enhancer element has been
  defined downstream of the CCND1 gene that mediates the binding of both the pioneer
  factor FOXA1 and estrogen-responsive ESR1 (Eeckhoute et al, 2006).
