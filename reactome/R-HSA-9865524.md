display_name: p-Y701-STAT1 binds the NLRP3 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Phosphorylated STAT1 binds two sites in the NLRP3 promoter: one site is
  750-764 bp upstream and the other site is 832-842 bp upstream of the transcription
  start site (Lv et al. 2024). Phosphorylated STAT1 enhances expression of NLRP3,
  a sensory subunit of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex that regulates secretion of
  cytokines (reviewed in Kodi et al. 2024).'

## Summary

Phosphorylated STAT1 binds two sites in the NLRP3 promoter: one site is 750-764 bp upstream and the other site is 832-842 bp upstream of the transcription start site (Lv et al. 2024). Phosphorylated STAT1 enhances expression of NLRP3, a sensory subunit of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex that regulates secretion of cytokines (reviewed in Kodi et al. 2024).
