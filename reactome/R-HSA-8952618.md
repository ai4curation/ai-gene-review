display_name: AcM-UBE2M transfers NEDD8 to CRL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'UBE2M transfers NEDD8 to lysine 720 of CUL1 in the CRL E3 ubiquitin ligase
  complex (Hori et al, 1999; Duda et al, 2008). Neddylation increases the ubiquitination
  activity of the E3 complex towards its targets, and prevents binding of the CUL1
  complex with the CAND1 inhibitor (Hori et al, 1999; Goldenberg et al, 2004; Duda
  et al, 2008; Kelsall et al, 2013; Scott et al, 2016). Targets of CUL1 RING complexes
  include a variety of cellular proteins including regulators of transcription and
  cell cycle progression, among others (reviewed in Lipkowitz and Weissman, 2011).
  CRL1 complexes are also hijacked by viruses, redirecting the ubiquitin ligase complex
  to target host proteins (reviewed in Mahon et al, 2014). '

## Summary

UBE2M transfers NEDD8 to lysine 720 of CUL1 in the CRL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Hori et al, 1999; Duda et al, 2008). Neddylation increases the ubiquitination activity of the E3 complex towards its targets, and prevents binding of the CUL1 complex with the CAND1 inhibitor (Hori et al, 1999; Goldenberg et al, 2004; Duda et al, 2008; Kelsall et al, 2013; Scott et al, 2016). Targets of CUL1 RING complexes include a variety of cellular proteins including regulators of transcription and cell cycle progression, among others (reviewed in Lipkowitz and Weissman, 2011). CRL1 complexes are also hijacked by viruses, redirecting the ubiquitin ligase complex to target host proteins (reviewed in Mahon et al, 2014).
