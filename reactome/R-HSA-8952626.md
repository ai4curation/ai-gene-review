display_name: AcM-UBE2M transfers NEDD8 to CRL2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: UBE2M transfers NEDD8 to lysine 689 of CUL2 in the E3 ligase complex (Hori
  et al, 1999; Duda et al, 2008). Neddylation increases the ubiquitin ligase activity
  of the E3 complex towards its targets, and prevents binding of the CUL2 complex
  with the CAND1 inhibitor (Hori et al, 1999; Duda et al, 2008). <br>Target specificity
  of the CRL2 complex is directed by the nature of the F box substrate recognition
  protein. The best characterized CRL2 F-box protein is the von Hippel- Lindau (VHL)
  tumor suppressor, which targets the alpha subunit of hypoxia inducible factor (HIFalpha),
  among other substrates (reviewed in Cai and Yang, 2016). Another example if CRL2/HRD1
  that has been reported to target NFE2L2 for degradation in liver (Wu et al, 2014).
  CRL2 complexes are hijacked by a number of viruses, including adenovirus, Epstein-Barr
  virus and HPV, among others. This redirects the ubiquitin ligase complex to target
  host proteins and in this way promotes viral propagation (reviewed in Mahon et al,
  2014).
