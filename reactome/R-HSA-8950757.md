display_name: IL12RB2 in IL12A:IL12RB1:p-Y-TYK2:IL12B:IL12RB2:p-JAK2 is phosphorylated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylated residues in the cytoplasmic region of Interleukin-12 receptor
  subunit beta 2 (IL12RB2) enable binding and activation of Signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 4  (STAT4) by means of Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2 (JAK2).<br>STAT4
  was found to bind only phosphorylated tyrosine-800, and not to phosphorylated tyrosines
  678 or 767 when phosphorylated.  Although required, phosphorylated tyrosine-800
  was not sufficient for binding of STAT4, as other residues in IL12RB2, specifically
  at -4, -1 and +1 relative to the tyrosine, contribute to the specificity of STAT4
  binding (Yao et al. 1999).<br>As the pattern of phosphorylations required for receptor
  activation is unknown, this is a black box event.
