display_name: TUSC3 transports Mg2+ from extracellular region to cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Magnesium (Mg2+) is required for the catalytic activity of numerous metalloenzymes
  within a variety of subcellular organelles. Tumor suppressor candidate 3 (TUSC3)
  is expressed in most non-lymphoid cells and tissues and is an essential protein
  in Mg2+ uptake into cells (Zhou & Clapham 2009).
