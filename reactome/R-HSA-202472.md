summary: 'TRAF6, which plays central role in innate immune responses, is implicated
  as proximal downstream effector of MALT1. TRAF6 is a member of the TRAF proteins.
  It contains an N-term RING domain, followed by several Zn finger domains and C-term
  MATH domain. The MALT1 oligomers bind to TRAF6, induce TRAF6 oligomerization and
  thereby activate the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6 to polyubiquitinate itself
  and NEMO. '

## Summary

TRAF6, which plays central role in innate immune responses, is implicated as proximal downstream effector of MALT1. TRAF6 is a member of the TRAF proteins. It contains an N-term RING domain, followed by several Zn finger domains and C-term MATH domain. The MALT1 oligomers bind to TRAF6, induce TRAF6 oligomerization and thereby activate the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6 to polyubiquitinate itself and NEMO.
