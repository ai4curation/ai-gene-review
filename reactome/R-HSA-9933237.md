display_name: PBRM1-containing ATPase complex binds SMARCC dimer:SMARCDs:SMARCE1:SMARCB1:ARID2:BRD&:PHF10
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cryo-EM studies of the pBAF complex bound to a nucleosome support a model
  where the catalytic core of the complex SMARCA2/4, is linked to the core or base
  module through a regulatory actin-related protein (ARP) module consisting of ACTB
  and ACTL6 that interacts with the HSA (helicase-SANT-associated) region of SMARCA2/3
  (Yuan et al, 2022; Wang et al, 2022; He et al, 2020). BCL7 proteins and the pBAF-specific
  factor PBRM1 appear to be integrated into the core/base module scaffolded by SMARCC,
  SMARCE1 and SMARCD1 (Wang et al, 2022; Yuan et al, 2022). BCL7 proteins also make
  contact with the HSA domain of SMARCA2/4 (Dietrich et al, 2023)<br>The existence
  of a distinct, separable ATPase module is supported by the purification of SMARCA4-containing
  complexes (Mashtalir et al, 2018). Distinct SMARCA4-containing fractions containing
  either SS18 or PBRM1 support the existence of mutually exclusive ATPase modules
  that are incorporated into either c- or ncBAF (SS18) or pBAF complexes (PBRM1),
  respectively (Mashtalir et al, 2018; Nakayama et al, 2017). From these studies,
  the ATPase module of the pBAF complex consists of SMARCA2/4, ACTB, ACTL6A/B, BCL7A/B/C
  and the pBAF-specific PBRM1 (Mashtalir et al, 2018; Mashtalir et al, 2020). Note,
  however, that the Cryo-EM studies support a model where PBRM1 is incorporated into
  pBAF as part of a BRD7:PHF10:PBRM1 module (Yuan et al, 2022; Wang et al, 2022).<br>
