display_name: Gamma carboxylation, hypusinylation, hydroxylation, and arylsulfatase
  activation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After translation, many newly formed proteins undergo further covalent modifications
  that alter their functional properties and that are essentially irreversible under
  physiological conditions in the body. These modifications include the vitamin K-dependent
  attachment of carboxyl groups to glutamate residues and the conversion of a lysine
  residue in eIF5A to hypusine, the conversion of a histidine residue in EEF to diphthamide,
  and the hydrxylation of various amino acid side chains.
