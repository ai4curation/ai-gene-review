stable_id: R-HSA-5654407
display_name: Activated FGFR2 phosphorylates SHC1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The p46 and p53 isoforms of SHC1 have been shown to be phosphorylated upon
  FGF stimulation.  Three consensus RTK phosphoryation sites are present in SHC1,
  although phosphorylation of these specific tyrosine residues has not been explicitly
  demonstrated in response to FGF stimulation.  In contrast, the p66 isoform of SHC1
  does not appear to undergo FGF-dependent phosphorylation.
