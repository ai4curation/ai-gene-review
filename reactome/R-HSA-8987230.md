display_name: p-STAT1 and p-STAT3 dissociates from IL26:IL10RB:p-TYK2:IL20RA:p-JAK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta (STAT1) are believed
  to dissociate from the Interleukin-26 (IL26) receptor complex. This is a black-box
  event because dissociation is inferred from other interleukin signaling cascades,
  e.g. Interleukin-10 (Niemand et al. 2003, Braum et al. 2013, Xiong et al. 2014,
  Sheikh et al. 2006) where dissociation occurs before dimerization and translocation
  to the nucleus.

## Summary

Phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta (STAT1) are believed to dissociate from the Interleukin-26 (IL26) receptor complex. This is a black-box event because dissociation is inferred from other interleukin signaling cascades, e.g. Interleukin-10 (Niemand et al. 2003, Braum et al. 2013, Xiong et al. 2014, Sheikh et al. 2006) where dissociation occurs before dimerization and translocation to the nucleus.
