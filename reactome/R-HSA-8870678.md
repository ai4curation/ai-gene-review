display_name: Cleaved fibrinogen products bind TLR4:LY96
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Fibrinogen, in addition to its role in coagulation, is also an acute phase
  protein of inflammation which can induce a cytokine production acting as an endogenous
  ligand for toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expressed on cells including macrophages
  and airway epithelial cells (Millien VO et al., 2013; Kuhns DB et al., 2007; Smiley
  ST et al., 2001). In human macrophages fibrinogen stimulated interleukin IL6 expression
  and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation ((Hodgkinson CP et
  al., 2008). In human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293)-CD14-MD2 cells expressing TLR4,
  fibrinogen induced robust phosphorylation of ERK1, p38alpha and JNK and activated
  transcription factors NFkappaB, Elk1 and AP1 (Hodgkinson CP et al., 2008). Moreover,
  proteinases, such as thrombin, can cleave fibrinogen. In mice, exposure to endogenous
  or exogenous proteinases lead to hyperactivation of an antifungal pathway and lead
  to allergic airway inflammation through activation of TLR4-dependent signaling pathway
  by fibrinogen cleaved products (Millien VO et al., 2013)
