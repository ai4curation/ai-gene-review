display_name: frog CK1gamma phosphorylates LRP5/6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Xenopus tropicalis Casein kinase 1 gamma was identified in a screen for proteins
  that covalently modify LRP6.  CK1gamma was shown to phosphorylate LRP6 in vitro
  and in vivo.  This phosphorylation is required for Axin recruitment and WNT signaling
  (Davidson et al, 2005).
