display_name: GBF1 stimulates nucleotide exchange on ARF4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GBF1 promotes guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF4 at the Golgi membrane,
  activating the small GTPase and promoting its association with the Golgi membrane
  (Szul et al, 2007; reviewed in Deretic, 2013). Activated ARF4 at the trans-Golgi
  network may represent the initial sorting point for membrane proteins destined for
  the cilium (reviewed in Li et al, 2012).

## Summary

GBF1 promotes guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF4 at the Golgi membrane, activating the small GTPase and promoting its association with the Golgi membrane (Szul et al, 2007; reviewed in Deretic, 2013). Activated ARF4 at the trans-Golgi network may represent the initial sorting point for membrane proteins destined for the cilium (reviewed in Li et al, 2012).
