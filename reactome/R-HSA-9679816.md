stable_id: R-HSA-9679816
display_name: SIGMAR1 binds dextromethorphan
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The antitussive drug dextromethorphan can elicit antidepressant-like actions
  at least in part through binding and stimulating the sigma non-opioid intracellular
  receptor 1 (SIGMAR1) (Lauterbach 2012, Fishback et al. 2010). Its endogenous ligand
  may be progesterone (Ganapathy et al. 1999). Small anecdotal studies suggest that
  ligands that target SIGMAR1 may be useful in treating central hypoventilation syndromes
  (Loiseau et al. 2018), suggesting a possible role for such drugs in treatment of
  COVID-19 symptoms.
