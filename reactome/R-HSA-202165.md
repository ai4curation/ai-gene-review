stable_id: R-HSA-202165
display_name: Phosphorylation of ITAM motifs in CD3 complexes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The autophosphorylated, active Lck is now proximally positioned to phosphorylate
  specific tyrosine residues within ITAMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motifs) located within the CD3 and the TCR zeta signaling chains of the TCR. ITAMs
  consist of evolutionarily conserved amino-acid sequence motifs of D/ExYxxLx(6-8)YxxL.
  Both the tyrosine residues in the motif are phosphorylated by Lck and the TCR complex
  include 10 ITAMs with one ITAM in each of the CD3 chains including the three tandem
  ITAMs in each zeta chains.
