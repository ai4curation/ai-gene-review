display_name: CD274 mRNA binds miR-34 RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a), a central regulator within the T cell regulatory
  network, plays a crucial role in T cell activation. It is broadly expressed across
  immune cell types, including dendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells, B cells,
  and T cells, where it influences their development, function, and survival (Taheri
  et al., 2020). In relation to PD-L1 regulation, miR-34a directly targets the 3'
  UTR of PD-L1 mRNA. This was demonstrated through a luciferase assay using HL-60
  and Kasumi-1 cell lines, where co-transfection with miR-34a resulted in reduced
  reporter activity, confirming its binding to PD-L1 and subsequent suppression of
  its expression. Moreover, miR-34a overexpression led to reduced PD-L1 surface levels
  and decreased T-cell apoptosis (Wang et al., 2015; Yong et al., 2020).
