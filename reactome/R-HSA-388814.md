stable_id: R-HSA-388814
display_name: Grb2 binds CD28
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CD28 binds to several signaling proteins, including Grb2, through its Src
  homology domains. The phosphorylated YMNM motif in CD28's cytoplasmic tail primarily
  interacts with Grb2's SH2 domain, while the SH3 domain of Grb2 simultaneously engages
  a diproline motif in the C-terminal region of CD28. This dual binding mechanism
  enhances the stability of the CD28-Grb2 interaction, facilitating downstream signaling
  events that are crucial for T cell activation and cytokine production (Okkenhaug
  and Rottapel 1998).
