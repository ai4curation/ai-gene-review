species: Homo sapiens
summary: During endocytosis the EPH-ephrin (EFN) intact complex and, possibly, associated
  cytoplasmic proteins, together with the surrounding plasma membrane, can be internalized
  into the EPH- or EFN-expressing cell. The clathrin pathway has been linked to EFNB
  endocytosis. C-terminal portion of EFNB1 encodes a putative endocytosis signal,
  a sequence that is recognized by the clathrin-associated adapter proteins required
  for loading molecules into clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. Treatment of cells
  expressing GFP-tagged EFNB1 with soluble, recombinant EPHB1/Fc fusion protein were
  internalized and observed in clathrin-coated vesicles. Internalized EFNB1 co-localizes
  with EEA1, an endosomal marker. EFNB1 internalization is inhibited by a dominant-negative
  dynamin mutant and potassium depletion. These results suggest that classical, clathrin-dependent
  endocytosis is responsible for EFNB internalization. (Parker at al. 2004).
