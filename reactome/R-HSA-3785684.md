display_name: Fibronectin degradation by CTSG
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Plasma fibronectin (FN1) is degraded by cathepsin G (CTSG) into a characteristic
  pattern of gelatin-binding peptides of M, = 64000, 40000, and 30000 (Vartio et al.
  1981, Vartio 1982). CTSG is activated by UV exposure and can activate matrix metalloproteinases
  MMP1 and MMP2, but increased levels of MMP activity did not correlate with increased
  FN degradation in normal human fibroblasts (NHFs) following exposure to UVB (50
  mJ/cm2) irradiation, while addtion of CTSG inhibitor decreased FN degradation, suggesting
  that  CTSG is directly  responsible for FN1 degradation (Son et al. 2009).
