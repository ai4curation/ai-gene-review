stable_id: R-HSA-2730849
display_name: Calcineurin binds and dephosphorylates NFAT
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) is  a transcription factor which
  induces genes responsible for cytokine production, for cell-cell interactions etc.
  NFAT transcription activity is modulated by  calcium and Calcineurin concentration.
  In resting cells NFAT is phosphorylated and resides in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation
  sites are located in NFAT''s regulatory domain in three different serine rich motifs,
  termed SRR1, SP2 and SP. Upon stimulation, these serine residues are dephosphorylated
  by calcineurin, that thought to cause exposure of nuclear localization signal sequences
  triggering translocation of the dephosphorylated NFAT-CaN complex to the nucleus.
  Among all the phosphorylation sites one of the site in SRR-2 motif is not susceptable
  to dephosphorylation by CaN (Takeuchi et al. 2007, Hogan et al. 2003).  '
