summary: In normal development vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are crucial
  regulators of vascular development during embryogenesis (vasculogenesis) and blood-vessel
  formation in the adult (angiogenesis). In tumor progression, activation of VEGF
  pathways promotes tumor vascularization, facilitating tumor growth and metastasis.
  Abnormal VEGF function is also associated with inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis,
  and hyperthyroidism. Inhibition of this process may provide clinical benefits to
  patients suffering from cancer, diabetic macular edema (DME) and age-related macular
  degeneration (AMD). VEGFA inhibitors are therapeutic options for these diseases
