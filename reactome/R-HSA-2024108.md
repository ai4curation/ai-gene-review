display_name: Some HSPGs are secreted to the plasma membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Depending on the nature of the core protein HS-GAGs are attached to, they
  will either translocate to the cell surface or be secreted into the extracellular
  matrix (ECM). Here, HS-GAGs are shown to translocate to the cell surface (Kjellen
  & Lindahl, 1991). The mechanism of transfer from the Golgi apparatus to the cell
  surface and beyond is unknown but most likely involves the trans-Golgi network.
