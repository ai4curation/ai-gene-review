stable_id: R-HSA-4395236
display_name: TP53 binds promoters of MIR34 genes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TP53 (p53) binds to the conserved p53 binding site located in the vicinity
  of the MIR34A transcription start (Chang et al. 2007, Raver-Shapira et al. 2007).
  TP53 also binds to conserved p53 binding sites in the promoter of clustered MIR34B
  and MIR34C genes, and the transcription of MIR34B and MIR34C microRNAs is directly
  positively regulated by p53 (He et al. 2007, Corney et al. 2007).
