summary: 'eNOS activity is regulated by numerous post-translational modifications
  including phosphorylation and acylation, which also modulate its interactions with
  other proteins and its subcellular localization.<p>In general, following myristoylation
  and palmitoylation, eNOS localizes to caveolae in the plasma membrane, where in
  resting cells, it is bound to caveolin and remains inactive. Several agonists that
  raise intracellular calcium concentrations promote calmodulin binding to eNOS and
  the dissociation of caveolin from the enzyme, leading to an activated eNOS-calmodulin
  complex.<p>Phosphorylation plays a significant role in regulating eNOS activity,
  especially the phosphorylation of Ser1177, located within the reductase domain,
  which increases enzyme activity by enhancing reductase activity and calcium sensitivity.
  In unstimulated, cultured endothelial cells, Ser1177 is rapidly phosphorylated following
  a variety of stimuli: fluid shear stress, insulin, estrogen, VEGF, or bradykinin.  The
  kinases involved in this process depend upon the stimuli applied.  For instance,
  shear stress phosphorylates Ser1177 by activating Akt and PKA; insulin activates
  both Akt and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); estrogen and VEGF mainly phosphorylate
  eNOS via Akt; whereas the bradykinin-induced phosphorylation of Ser1177 is mediated
  by CaMKII.  When Ser1177 is phosphorylated, NO production is increased several-fold
  above basal levels.<p>The phosphorylation of a threonine residue (Thr 495), located
  in the CaM binding domain, is associated with a decrease in eNOS activity. When
  this residue is dephosphorylated, substantially more CaM binds to eNOS and elevates
  enzyme activity. Stimuli associated with dephosphorylation of Thr495 (e.g., bradykinin,
  histamine, and Ca2+ ionophores) also increase Ca2+ levels resulting in the phosphorylation
  of Ser1177.<p>Additional phosphorylation sites, such as Ser114 and Ser633, and tyrosine
  phosphorylation have all been detected, but their functional relevance remains unclear.
  It is speculated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of eNOS is unlikely to affect
  enzyme activity directly, but more likely to impact the protein-protein interactions
  with associated scaffolding and regulatory proteins.'
