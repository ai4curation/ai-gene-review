stable_id: R-HSA-8877451
display_name: MON1:CCZ1 exchanges GTP for GDP on RAB7
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAB7 acts downstream of RAB5 in a RAB cascade that regulates endolysosomal
  trafficking (Chavrier et al, 1990; Feng et al, 1997; Vitelli et al, 1997; reviewed
  in Epp et al, 2011; Solinger and Spang, 2013). The RAB7 GEF complex, MON:CCZ1, is
  recruited to the endosome through interaction with RAB5 and the RAB5 effector complex
  CORVET (Nordmann et al, 2010; Gerondopolous et al, 2012; Poteryaev et al, 2010;
  Wang et al, 2002; Kinchen and Ravichandran, 2010; reviewed in Wang et al, 2011;
  Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013). Recruitment of MON1:CCZ1 leads to the displacement
  RAB5 and the RAB5 GEF RABEX5, and subsequent recruitment and activation of RAB7
  (Poteryaev et al, 2010; reviewed in Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013; Wandinger-Ness
  and Zerial, 2014; Ishida et al, 2016). RAB7 is also involved in more specialized
  trafficking pathways involved in phagocytosis, autophagy and retromer-mediated endocytosis,
  among others (Gutierrez et al, 2004; Harrison et al, 2003; Cantalupo et al, 2003;
  reviewed in Hyttinen et al, 2013)
