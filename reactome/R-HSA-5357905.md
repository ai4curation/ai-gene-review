species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) is an inflammatory cytokine, that activates
  either cell survival (e.g.,inflammation, proliferation) or cell death upon association
  with TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). Stimuli and the cellular context dictate cell fate
  decisions between survival and death which rely on tightly regulated mechanisms
  with checkpoints on many levels. The TNFR1 signaling is controlled by the interplay
  between post-translational modifications such as proteolytic processing by active
  caspases or ubiquitination/deubiquitination by LUBAC or CYLD ubiquitin-editing complexes.
  TNFR1-mediated NFkappaB activation leads to the pro-survival transcriptional program
  that is both anti-apoptotic and highly proinflammatory. The constitutive NFkappaB
  or AP1 activation may lead to excessive inflammation which has been associated with
  a variety of aggressive tumor types (Jackson-Bernitsas DG et al. 2007; Zhang JY
  et al. 2007). Thus, the tight regulation of TNFα:TNFR1 signaling is required to
  ensure the appropriate cell response to stimuli. '

## Summary

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) is an inflammatory cytokine, that activates either cell survival (e.g.,inflammation, proliferation) or cell death upon association with TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1).
