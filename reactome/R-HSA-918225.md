display_name: TBK1/IKK epsilon complex interacts with MAVS bound TRAF3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRAF3 binds both mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS, also known
  as IPS‑1) and downstream interferon regulatory factor 3/7 (IRF3/7) kinases TBK1
  and IKK‑epsilon (IKKi, IKBKE) and thus serves as a critical link between RIG‑I (DDX58)/MDA5
  (IFIH1) adaptors and downstream regulatory kinases important for interferon regulatory
  factor (IRF) activation (Oganesyan et al. 2006).<p>SIKE (Suppressor of IKK-epsilon)
  interacts with IKBKE and TBK1. SIKE is associated with TBK1 under physiological
  conditions and dissociated from TBK1 upon viral infection. Overexpression of SIKE
  disrupted the interactions of IKBKE or TBK1 with RIG‑I (DDX58).<p>SARS-CoV-1 M protein
  prevents the formation of the TRAF3:TANK:TBK1/IKBKE complex and thereby inhibits
  TBK1/IKBKE-dependent activation of IRF3/IRF7 transcription factors (Siu KL et al.
  2009).
