species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Together with two B-type cyclins, CCNB1 and CCNB2, Cdc2 (CDK1) regulates
  the transition from G2 into mitosis. CDK1 can also form complexes with Cyclin A
  (CCNA1 and CCNA3). CDK1 complexes with A and B type cyclins are activated by dephosphorylation
  of CDK1 threonine residue T14 and tyrosine residue Y15. Cyclin A:CDK1 and Cyclin
  B:CDK1 complexes phosphorylate several proteins involved in mitotic spindle formation
  and function, the breakdown of the nuclear envelope, and chromosome condensation
  that is necessary for the ~2 meters of DNA to be segregated at mitosis (Nigg 1998,
  Nilsson and Hoffmann 2000, Salaun et al. 2008, Fisher et al. 2012). '
