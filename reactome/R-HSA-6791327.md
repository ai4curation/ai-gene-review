display_name: TP53 binds the BCL2L14 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TP53 (p53) binds the p53 response element in the first intron of the BCL2L14
  (BCLG) gene. Another p53 response element is found in the promoter region of the
  BCL2L14 gene but seems to interact with TP53 with low affinity (Miled et al. 2005).
