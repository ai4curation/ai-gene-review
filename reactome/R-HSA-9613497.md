display_name: Unwinding DNA for the nascent transcript
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The human BTF2 basic transcription factor (also called TFIIH), is required
  for class1 gene transcription of transcripts. TFIIH has an adenosine triphosphate-dependent
  DNA helicase activity.  The helicase activity is closely associated with the multi-subunit
  BTF2/TFIIH transcription factor which also has a CTD protein kinase activity.
