display_name: IL1F10 binds IL1RL2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukins are immunomodulatory proteins that elicit a wide array of responses
  in cells and tissues. Interleukin 1 family member 10 (IL1F10, IL 38) is a member
  of the IL1 family (Lin et al. 2001, Bensen et al. 2001). IL1F10 is produced in Human
  apoptotic cells (Mora et al. 2016) and human epidermal keratinocytes (based on mRNA
  studies) (Boutet M A et al. 2016). IL1F10 can bind to interleukin 1 receptor like
  2 (IL1RL2, IL 36R, IL1Rrp2, IL1R6). This binding has biological consequences similar
  to another IL1RL2 ligand   IL 36 receptor antagonist (IL 36Ra), such as suppression
  of IL17 and IL22 and induction of IL6 production (van de Veerdonk et al. 2012, Mora
  et al. 2016). Ultimately, these events lead to suppression of cytokine production
  in several types of immune cells resulting in reduced inflammation.
