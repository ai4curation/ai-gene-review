display_name: TCF7L2/TCF7L1 bind CTBP1 to repress WNT target genes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In addition to repressing WNT-dependent targets through Groucho/TLE proteins,
  some TCF/LEF transcription factors may also work by recruiting the CTBP1 and CTBP2
  repressors (Duval et al, 2000).  CTBP-binding regions are present in the 'E-form'
  splice variants of TCF7L2 and in TCF7L1 and in vitro interactions have been demonstrated
  in Xenopus and mammals, although the in vivo relevance of these interactions is
  unclear (Brannon et al, 1999; Valenta et al, 2003; Cuilliere-Dartigues et al, 2006;
  Tang et al, 2008; Hamada and Bienz, 2004).  Abrogation of the interaction interface
  results in a loss of TCF-CTBP colocalization and increased expression of a TCF-dependent
  reporter gene (Cuilliere-Dartigues et al, 2006; Tang et al, 2008).
