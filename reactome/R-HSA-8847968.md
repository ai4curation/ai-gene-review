stable_id: R-HSA-8847968
display_name: PTEN binds FRK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FRK (RAK), a SRC family member kinase, binds PTEN. The interaction involves
  the SH3 domain of FRK and the C2 domain of PTEN (Yim et al. 2009). Like other SRC
  family members, FRK is autophosphorylated on a C-terminal tyrosine residue Y387.
  FRK possesses a nuclear localization signal and is found in both nucleus and the
  cytosol (Cance et al. 1994).
