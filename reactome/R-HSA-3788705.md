display_name: CDKN1A (p21) prevents phosphorylation of Cdh1 by Cyclin A:Cdk2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: At the G1/S transition, the Cdh1 (FZR1) subunit of the APC/C:Cdh1 complex
  is phosphorylated by Cyclin A:Cdk2 (CCNA:CDK2) and dissociates from APC/C. This
  inactivates APC/C and permits the accumulation of cell cycle proteins required for
  DNA synthesis and entry into mitosis (Lukas et al. 1999).  Activation of the ATM
  kinase by DNA damage in the form of double strand breaks results in TP53-mediated
  induction of CDKN1A (p21) expression. CDKN1A binds CCNA:CDK2 complex and prevents
  it from phosphorylating Cdh1 (Takahashi et al. 2012).
