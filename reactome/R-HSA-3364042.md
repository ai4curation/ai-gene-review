display_name: APC promotes disassembly of beta-catenin transactivation complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Studies in mouse myoblast and colorectal cancer cell lines show that APC,
  beta-TrCP and the CTBP corepressor are present at the MYC enhancer at times when
  beta-catenin and its associated coactivators are also present. Binding of APC is
  correlated with dissociation of the activator complex and precedes recruitment of
  TLE1 and HDAC1, suggesting that APC may promote the exchange between activator and
  repressor complexes at the enhancer (Sierra et al, 2006).  CSNK1gamma phosphorylation
  of APC strongly increases its affinity for beta-catenin, and a phosphorylated APC
  fragment disrupts the formation of a DNA:LEF1:beta-catenin complex by EMSA, consistent
  with previous reports (Xing et al, 2003; Xing et al, 2004; Sierra et al, 2006).  Because
  beta-catenin is unable to simultaneously bind APC and TCF/LEF, however, the mechanism
  of APC recruitment to the enhancer complex is unclear (Sierra et al, 2006).  Full-length
  APC associates with CTBP in vitro and in vivo (Hamada and Bienz, 2004; Sierra et
  al, 2006) while Class I and Class II mutant APC proteins, which are commonly found
  in colorectal cancers, do not (Sierra et al, 2006; reviewed in Neufeld, 2009).  CTBP
  repressor functions may therefore include facilitating the exchange of coactivator
  and corepressor complexes at WNT target genes.
