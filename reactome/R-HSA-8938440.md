stable_id: R-HSA-8938440
display_name: miR-17 binds RUNX1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA miR-17 binds the 3' UTR of the RUNX1 mRNA. As miR-17 does not affect
  RUNX1 mRNA levels, it presumably function as part of the nonendonucleolytic RISC
  (Fontana et al. 2007).

## Summary

MicroRNA miR-17 binds the 3' UTR of the RUNX1 mRNA. As miR-17 does not affect RUNX1 mRNA levels, it presumably function as part of the nonendonucleolytic RISC (Fontana et al. 2007).
