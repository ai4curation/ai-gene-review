stable_id: R-HSA-443402
display_name: GP1b-IX-V:13-3-3-zeta complexes with p85 PI3K
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Resting platelets contain a heterotrimeric complex of GPIb-IX-V, 14-3-3-zeta
  and the p85 subunit of PI-3K. While GPIb-IX-V has no apparent binding sites for
  PI3K so the interaction with p85 is likely to be mediated by 14-3-3-zeta.
