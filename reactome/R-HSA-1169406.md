stable_id: R-HSA-1169406
display_name: ISGylation of host proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Many host proteins are targets for ISGylation including constitutively expressed
  proteins involved in various cellular pathways such as immunity, RNA splicing, chromatin
  remodeling/polymerase II transcription, stress responses and translation. Many ISG15
  target proteins are IFN alpha/beta-induced antiviral proteins such as PKR, MxA,
  IRF3, and RIG-I, also included are several key regulators of signal transduction
  such as PLC gamma1, JAK1, STAT1 and ERK1. The contribution of most of these modified
  proteins to antiviral activity is unclear because the fate of the vast majority
  of ISGylated target proteins is unknown.
