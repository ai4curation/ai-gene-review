display_name: Phosphorylated heterodimers of ERBB2 TMD/JMD mutants and EGFR bind GRB2:SOS1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activation of downstream RAS signaling was shown for ERBB2 S653C (de Martino
  et al. 2014) and ERBB2 R678Q (Bose et al. 2013, de Martino et al. 2014) through
  activating tyrosine phosphorylation on ERKs (MAPK1 and MAPK3).  It is assumed that
  heterodimers of ERBB2 TMD/JMD mutants and EGFR, like the wild type ERBB2:EGFR heterodimers,
  directly bind to GRB:SOS1 complex.
