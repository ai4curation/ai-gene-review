display_name: TCF7L1/TCF7L2/LEF1:CTNNB1 promote transcription of the MYC gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TCF7L1 (also known as TCF3), TCF7L3 (also known as LEF1) and TCF7L2 (also
  known as TCF4) have been demonstrated to bind to the MYC gene in vivo and in vitro
  and to mediate beta-catenin dependent transcription (Park et al, 2009; He et al,
  1998; Sierra et al, 2006).  Aberrant beta-catenin dependent activation of the MYC
  gene contributes to oncogenic signaling and cellular proliferation in colorectal
  and other cancers (see for instance Sansom et al, 2007; Moumen et al, 2013; reviewed
  in Wilkins and Sansom, 2008; Cairo et al, 2012).<br>Binding of RUNX3 to the CTNNB1:TCF7L2
  and possibly to the CTNNB1:LEF1 and TCF7L1 complexes, prevents binding of CTNNB1
  complexes to the MYC promoter, thus negatively regulating MYC transcription (Ito
  et al. 2008).
