display_name: GPIb-IX-V binding to 14-3-3 zeta is reduced by shear stress
species: Homo sapiens
summary: High shear stress, or immobilization of VWF under high shear conditions induce
  VWF binding to GPIb-IX-V. This activation mechanism is believed to involve shear-stress
  induced conformational changes in vWF.

## Summary

High shear stress, or immobilization of VWF under high shear conditions induce VWF binding to GPIb-IX-V. This activation mechanism is believed to involve shear-stress induced conformational changes in vWF.
