display_name: The TRAMP:RNA exosome oligoadenylates pre-rRNA 5' external transcribed
  spacer (5'ETS) fragment
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the nucleolus, the TENT4A (PAPD7) or TENT4B (PAPD5) subunit of the TRAMP
  complex (MTREX:TENT4A,B:ZCCHC7) oligoadenylates an RNA substrate, the 5' external
  transcribed spacer (5'ETS) that has been cleaved from the 47S pre-rRNA (Lubas et
  al. 2011, Sudo et al. 2016).
