display_name: COQ6 hydroxylates DHB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Flavin-dependent monooxygenase COQ6 (Heeringa et al. 2011) catalyses the
  C5-hydroxylation of 3-decaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) to 3,4-dihydroxy-5-decaprenylbenzoic
  acid (DHDB). The electrons needed likely come from the iron-sulfur cluster on a
  ferredoxin that is recycled with NADPH (Nicoll et al., 2024; Gonzalez et al., 2023).
  COQ6 is a peripheral membrane protein that localizes to the matrix side of the inner
  mitochondrial membrane (Gin et al. 2003).  This reaction involving COQ6 was first
  confirmed in yeast, where hexaprenyl sidechains occur instead of decaprenyl moieties
  in human (Ozeir et al. 2011, Gin et al. 2003). In mammals, the decarboxylation and
  C1 hydroxylation reactions occur before or independently of the C5 hydroxylation
  (Acosta Lopez et al., 2019). Implication of a ferredoxin-ferredoxin reductase system
  to reduce COQ6 was initially proposed in yeast (Ozeir et al, 2011) and was validated
  in vitro with the resurrected tetrapod ancestral proteins COQ6, FDX2 and FDXR (Nicoll
  et al., 2024). This reaction involving COQ6 was first confirmed in yeast, where
  hexaprenyl sidechains occur instead of decaprenyl moieties in human (Ozeir et al.
  2011, Gin et al. 2003).
