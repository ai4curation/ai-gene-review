summary: Surfactant-containing lamellar bodies (LBs) are secreted from alveolar type
  II cells. Regulation of this secretion process is mediated by three G protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCR)-mediated pathways; P2RY2 purinoreceptor pathway (Rice & Singleton
  1986), beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) pathway (Dobbs & Mason 1979) and adenosine
  A2B pathway (Gilfillan & Rooney 1987). Activation of these GPCR pathways cause increases
  in second messengers, such as adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) or cytosolic
  Ca2+, and stimulation of downstream kinases such as protein kinase C that leads
  to surfactant secretion (Voyno-Yasenetskaya et al. 1991). The orphan receptor GPR116
  can negatively mediate this secretory process as well as having a stimulatory effect
  on surfactant reuptake. Gpr116-deficient mice were found to have excessive secretion
  and accumulation of surfactant in their airspaces after birth (Yang et al. 2013,
  Bridges et al. 2013, Fukuzawa et al. 2013, Liebscher et al. 2014).
