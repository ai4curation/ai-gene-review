display_name: Hh processing variants are recruited to SEL1:SYVN at the ER membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: As is the case for the WT Hh C-terminal fragment, siRNA depletion of SEL1
  and SYVN1 inhibits the degradation of processing-defective Hh mutants, suggesting
  these versions of Hh are also targets for ERAD-mediated degradation (Chen et al,
  2011; Huang et al, 2013).

## Summary

As is the case for the WT Hh C-terminal fragment, siRNA depletion of SEL1 and SYVN1 inhibits the degradation of processing-defective Hh mutants, suggesting these versions of Hh are also targets for ERAD-mediated degradation (Chen et al, 2011; Huang et al, 2013).
