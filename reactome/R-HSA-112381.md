display_name: Hyperphosphorylation (Ser2) of RNA Pol II CTD by P-TEFb complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cdk-9 is the kinase subunit of P-TEFb that phosphorylates Serine 2 on the
  heptapeptide repeats of Pol II CTD alleviating the negative action of DSIF-NELF
  complex.  This reaction is considered to be a rate limiting step for processive
  elongation. P-TEFb complex, that has a DRB-sensitive cyclin-dependent kinase activity,
  is composed of ~43 kDa, Cdk9 kinase (PITALRE), and either Cyclin T1, Cyclin T2a,
  Cyclin T2b, or Cyclin K. The exact mechanism by which P-TEFb removes the inhibition
  of elongation by DSIF-NELF is not yet known. P-TEFb is also capable of phosphorylating
  Spt5 subunit of DSIF complex.  <BR> A P-TEFb complex (which contains only the Cyclin

  (HIV-1) transcripts. Cyclin T1 subunit of the P-TEFb(Cyclin T1:Cdk9) complex interacts
  with HIV-1 encoded Tat protein that binds to the transactivation response (TAR)
  element in the nascent HIV-1 transcript (reviewed in Price,2000). <BR>The mechanism
