display_name: SRC1-1 binds SH2D2A and is recruited to VEGFR2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'SH2D2A (also known as TSAD) bound to VEGFR2 forms a complex with Src to
  regulate stress fiber formation and endothelial cell (EC) migration. This contributes
  to EC migration during pathological angiogenesis and thus the recruitment of SH2D2A
  is associated with cancer angiogenesis (Matsumoto et al. 2005). '

# SRC1-1 binds SH2D2A and is recruited to VEGFR2

## Summary

SH2D2A (also known as TSAD) bound to VEGFR2 forms a complex with Src to regulate stress fiber formation and endothelial cell (EC) migration. This contributes to EC migration during pathological angiogenesis and thus the recruitment of SH2D2A is associated with cancer angiogenesis (Matsumoto et al. 2005).
