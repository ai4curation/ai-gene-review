display_name: MYC binds MAPKAPK5 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MYC binds to consensus sites in the MAPKAPK5 gene promoter as assessed by
  ChIP (Kress et al, 2011). Although not depicted here and not experimentally validated
  in this context, MYC likely binds the promoter in the context of a MYC:MAX heterodimer.
