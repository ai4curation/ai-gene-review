display_name: CHST11,12,13,9 transfer sulfate to (4-)GalNAc
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 11, 12 and 13 (CHST11, 12 and 13, aka C4ST-1,
  -2 and -3), as well as CHST9, catalyse the transfer of sulfate from PAPS to position
  4 of the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue of the chondroitin chain on chondroitin
  sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG, Kang et al. 2001, Okuda et al. 2000, Hiraoka et al.
  2000, Kang et al. 2002 respectively). It is unclear if CHST9, 12, 13 contribute
  much to this activity in vivo. Mutations in CHST11 can cause bilateral symmetric
  skeletal defects (OCBMD, MIM:618167; Shabbir et al., 2018).
