display_name: NEMF polymerizes alanine residues onto the C-terminus of the nascent
  peptide ("CAT tailing")
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NEMF transfers alanine residues from aminoacyl tRNAs to the C-terminus of
  the nascent peptide, a process termed Carboxy-terminal Alanine and Threonine tailing
  (CAT-tailing) (Udagawa et al. 2021, Thrun et al. 2021, inferred from the yeast homolog
  RQC2 in Shen et al. 2015, Kostova et al. 2017, Osuna et al. 2017). In yeast, RQC2
  polymerizes a mix of alanine and threonine residues (Shen et al. 2015, Kostova et
  al. 2017, Osuna et al. 2017). Structures of CAT-tailing intermediates in yeast indicate
  that RQC2 positions an aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site of the 60S subunit and eIF5A
  enables peptidyl transfer (Shen et al. 2015, Tesina et al. 2023). The alanine C-terminal
  tails are believed to push the nascent peptide through the exit tunnel to expose
  lysine residues for ubiquitination by LTN1, however the alanine tails can also cause
  aggregation of nascent peptides (inferred from yeast homologs in Yonashiro et al.
  2016). In yeast, CAT-tailing does not appear to be required for subsequent ubiquitination
  by LTN1 (Shen et al. 2015), but does increase the efficiency of ubiquitination in
  vitro (Osuna et al. 2017). Mutations that affect NEMF activity cause motor neurodegeneration
  in mice (Martin et al. 2020).
