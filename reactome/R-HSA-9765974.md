display_name: MCRIP1 binds CTBP1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MCRIP1 forms a complex with CTBP1. Binding of MCRIP1 to CTBP1 prevents formation
  of the complex between ZEB1 and CTBP1. Phosphorylation of MCRIP1 by activated MAPKs
  (ERKs) prevents association of MCRIP1 with CTBP1 (Ichikawa et al. 2015). MCRIP1
  is also able to form a complex with CTBP2, but the biological significance of this
  complex is unknown (Ichikawa et al. 2015). Mouse Mcrip1 and Ctbp1/Ctbp2 were also
  shown to interact, with Mcrip1 competitively inhibiting binding of other transcription
  factors to Ctbp1 (Weng et al. 2019).
