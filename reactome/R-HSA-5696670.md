species: Homo sapiens
summary: A chromatin remodeling enzyme CHD1L (ALC1) is recruited to DNA damage sites
  through interaction with PARylated PARP1 (or possibly PARP2) (Ahel et al. 2009)
  or PARylated DDB2 (Pines et al. 2012). CHD1L catalyzes PARP-stimulated nucleosome
  sliding and is needed for efficient PARP-dependent DNA repair (Ahel et al. 2009).
  CHD1L depletion or PARP inhibition impair global genomic nucleotide excision repair
  (GG-NER) of UV-induced DNA damage (Pines et al. 2012).
