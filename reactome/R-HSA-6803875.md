stable_id: R-HSA-6803875
display_name: SFN dimer binds CDK1 and CCNB1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SFN (14-3-3-sigma) dimer binds the complex of CCNB1 (cyclin B1) and CDK1
  (Cdc2) in the cytosol and prevents the translocation of the CCNB1:CDK1 complex into
  the nucleus. This induces G2 cell cycle arrest as nuclear localization of the CCNB1:CDK1
  complex is necessary for phosphorylation of nuclear target proteins that are needed
  for the G2/M transition (Chan et al. 1999).
