display_name: JAK1/JAK2/TYK2 bound to IL6ST:IL6ST are phosphorylated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin 35 (IL35) may presumably signal via a complex that includes Tyrosine
  protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and JAK2 associated with Interleukin 6 receptor beta
  subunit (IL6ST) dimers (Collison et al. 2012). These JAKs are believed to phosphorylate
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT) (Stark GR and Darnell
  JE, 2012). As the series of events that induces JAK/STAT phosphorylation events
  in response to IL35 are not clear, this event is represented as a black box.
