display_name: NEK6/NEK7 phosphorylates NUP98
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation of NUP98 by NEK6 (and/or NEK7) promotes nuclear envelope
  permeabilization by initiating nuclear pore complex (NPC) disassembly. Two NUP98
  serine residues, S591 and S822 (referring to NUP98 splice variant NUP98-4; these
  residues correspond to S608 and S839 of NUP98 splice variant NUP98-3), are phosphorylated
  on NUP98 isolated from mitotic HeLa cells (human cervical cancer cell line). These
  serine residues match the NEK6 target site consensus and are phosphorylated by NEK6
  in vitro. Both sites can also be phosphorylated in vitro by NEK7 and weakly by NEK2.
  As NEK7 but not NEK2 was shown to be involved, with NEK6, in nuclear envelope permeabilization,
  NEK2 is not shown as the NUP98 kinase. Phosphorylated NUP98 dissociates from the
  NPC (Laurell et al. 2011). As NUP98 localizes to both sides of the NPC, cytosolic
  and nucleoplasmic (Griffis et al. 2003), the reaction shows a portion of NUP98 being
  released to the cytosol, and a portion of NUP98 dissociating into the nucleus, similar
  to what is observed by immunocytochemistry (Laurell et al. 2011).
