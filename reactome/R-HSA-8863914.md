display_name: Transport of SEC22B, TAP and PLC from ER to ERGIC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In DCs subset of ER proteins including MHC-I peptide loading complex (PLC)
  and transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) transit to phagosomes via
  the intermediate compartment ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Cebrian
  et al. 2011). TAP exits the ER in COPII vesicles in association with MHC class I,
  and that peptide translocation by TAP and binding to class I can occur in post-ER
  compartments (Ghanem et al. 2010). SEC22B, an ER-resident SNARE is required for
  the transport of PLC from ERGIC (Cebrian et al. 2011), but this step does not deliver
  MHC-I (Nair-Gupta et al. 2014). Instead, MHC-I are recruited from an endosomal recycling
  compartment (ERC), which is marked by Rab11a, VAMP3/cellubrevin, and VAMP8/endobrevin
  that holds large reserves of MHC-I. This step is dependent on TLR signalling (Nair-Gupta
  et al. 2014).
