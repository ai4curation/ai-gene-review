summary: 'Binding of TNFα to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) induces either cell survival or
  cell death through the sequential formation of several signaling complexes, namely
  complex-I, IIa and IIb (Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003; Walczak H 2011). The dynamic
  assembly of these complexes is tightly regulated by proteolysis, ubiquitination,
  deubiquitination and phosphorylation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein
  kinase 1 (RIPK1) and other components of the TNFα signaling pathway. The rapidly
  forming complex-I (the TNFR1 signaling complex) is assembled at the receptor’s cytoplasmic
  tail and consists of TNFR1, TNFR1-associated death domain (TRADD), TNF receptor
  associated factor-2 (TRAF2) and RIPK1 (Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003). The activated
  TNFR1 signaling complex (complex-I) recruits several E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases,
  such as cIAP1/2 cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (BIRC2, BIRC3), mind bomb 2 (MIB2)
  or linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) (Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003;
  Feltham R et al. 2018; Yuan J et al. 2019). K63-linked ubiquitination by BIRC2,
  BIRC3 and MIB2 as well as LUBAC-mediated Met1-linked linear ubiquitination of RIPK1
  and other complex components stabilize the membrane-bound pro-survival TNFR1 signaling
  complex, while suppressing the formation of the cytosolic death-inducing complex
  IIa (TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1:FADD:CASP8) and IIb (RIPK1:RIPK3:MLKL). The catalytic activity
  of LUBAC also enables recruitment of TRAF-associated NF-κB activator (TANK) binding
  kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor-kappa-B kinase (IKK) epsilon (IKKε or IKBKE) to the
  TNFR1 signaling complex (Lafont E et al. 2018; Xu D et al. 2018). LUBAC is composed
  of the HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN subunits. HOIP deficiency strongly diminished
  recruitment of TBK1 or IKBKE to the complex-I in human cervical carcinoma epithelial
  HeLa cells and lung carcinoma epithelial A549 cells (Lafont E et al. 2018). Western
  blot analysis revealed that TBK1 and IKBKE are recruited to and strongly phosphorylated
  within the TNFR1 complex in various TNFα-stimulated human cell lines including A549,
  keratinocyte HaCaT, monocytic U937 and THP-1 cells (Lafont E et al. 2018). Similarly,
  TBK1 was found to associate with components of the complex-I in the LUBAC-dependent
  manner in mouse cells (Xu D et al. 2018). IKBKE, but not TBK1, was detected within
  the TNFR1 complex in human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)-immortalized
  dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with TBK1 deficiency as a result of loss-of-function
  mutation at W619* (Taft J et al. 2021). The enzymatic activity of TBK1/IKBKE is
  initiated by phosphorylation at S172 located in the T loop of the TBK1 and IKKε
  kinase domains (Shimada T et al. 1999; Kishore N et al. 2002; Gu L et al. 2013).
  Activated TBK1 and IKBKE are known to trigger phosphorylation of interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7 and subsequent expression of type I interferons (IFNs;
  IFN-α/β) downstream of pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors
  3 and 4 (TLR3, TLR4), cGAS/STING and RIG-I-like receptors (Fitzgerald KA et al.
  2003; Fang R et al. 2017). While TBK1 or IKBKE showed limited effect on TNF-induced
  gene expression in human A549 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (Lafont E et
  al. 2018), both kinases prevented TNFα-induced cell death by suppressing RIPK1 activation
  in human and mouse cells (Lafont E et al. 2018; Xu D et al. 2018; Taft J et al.
  2021). Mechanistically, TBK1 and/or IKBKE directly phosphorylate RIPK1 within the
  TNFR1 signaling complex to prevent RIPK1 kinase-dependent cell death signaling downstream
  of TNFR1 (Lafont E et al. 2018; Xu D et al. 2018). Mass spectrometry analysis suggests
  that human RIPK1 is phosphorylated by TBK1 at T189 (Xu D et al. 2018). Using a phospho-specific
  antibody, T189 of RIPK1 was detected as a phosphorylation site upon incubation with
  TBK1 in in vitro kinase assay and upon co-expression of tagged proteins in human
  embryonic kidney HEK293T cells. This phosphorylation was inhibited by TBK1/IKBKE
  inhibitor MRT67307 (Xu D et al. 2018). Phosphorylation of endogenous RIPK1 at T189
  was detected in TNF-stimulated Jurkat cells (Xu D et al. 2018). Others reported
  that TBK1 or IKBKE phosphorylate RIPK1 at multiple residues (Lafont E et al. 2018).
  Further, TBK1 or IKBKE deficiency enhanced TNF-induced autophosphorylation of RIPK1,
  association of RIPK3 with caspase-8:FADD and levels of phosphorylated MLKL in human
  A549 and HeLa cells (Lafont E et al. 2018). Similar findings were reported for mouse
  cells (Lafont E et al. 2018; Xu D et al. 2018). In vivo studies showed that the
  embryonic lethality of Tbk1−/− mice was caused by TNFα-stimulated hyperactivation
  of  RIPK1 kinase activity (Xu D et al. 2018). Moreover, chronic systemic autoinflammation
  in patients carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TBK1 (W619*, R440*
  and Y212D) is associated with enhanced TNFα-induced RIPK1-dependent cell death (Taft
  J et al. 2021). In addition, TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of CYLD may also control
  the TNFR1 signaling pathway by regulating the ubiquitination status of RIPK1 (Xu
  X et al. 2020; Taft J et al. 2021). These data suggest that TBK1 and IKBKE downregulate
  RIPK1 auto-phosphorylation within the complex-I, thereby preventing TNFα- induced
  RIPK1-kinase-activity-dependent cell death.<p>This Reactome event describes TBK1/IKBKE-mediated
