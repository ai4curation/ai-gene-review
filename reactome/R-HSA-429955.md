stable_id: R-HSA-429955
display_name: CCR4-NOT complex deadenylates mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The CCR4-NOT complex hydrolyzes adenosine residues at the 3' end of polyadenylated
  mRNA, shortening the number of adenosine residues to about 10-15 residues and yielding
  adenosine 5'-monophosphate. CNOT6 and CNOT6L are the exoribonucleases responsible
  for hydrolysis. Activity of the CCR4-NOT complex is inhibited by PABP bound to the
  poly(A) tail of the mRNA. The trigger for activation of deadenylation by the CCR4-NOT
  complex is unknown. Complexes containing CNOT7 rather than CNOT8 appear to be responsible
  for cytoplasmic mRNA decay.
