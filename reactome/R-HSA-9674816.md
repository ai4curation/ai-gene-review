species: Homo sapiens
summary: CSF3 (G-CSF) signaling activates ERKs (ERK1, ERK2) via RAS. One possible
  mechanism of RAS activation is the dephosphorylation of KRAS (the dominant isoform
  of RAS in hematopoietic cells) by phosphorylated PTPN11 (also known as SHP-2 or
  SHP2) (Kano et al. 2019, also inferred from dephosphorylation of the HRAS paralog
  in Bunda et al. 2015) bound to phosphorylated CSF3R. Dephosphorylation of RAS increases
  the association of RAS with its downstream effector RAF. Inhibition of PTPN11 in
  mouse cells indicates that this pathway accounts for most but not all activation
  of ERKs in response to CSF3 (Jack et al. 2009, Zhang and Friedman 2011). Guanyl
  nucleotide exchange factors SOS or VAV bound to GRB2 may also be responsible for
  some activation of RAS in response to CSF3, but this has not yet been demonstrated.
