stable_id: R-HSA-8865275
display_name: PDGF-BB clevage by Furin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After dimerization of the PDGF-A and PDGF-B chains in the ER of producing
  cells, the dimers are proteolytically cleaved in the trans-Golgi network during
  protein maturation and secretion. The dibasic-specific proprotein convertase, furin,
  or related convertases are involved in the conversion of proPDGF forms to active
  PDGF forms. PDGF-A chains are expressed as two different isoforms, a longer and
  a shorter form.The longer (241 aa) is less common and differs from the shorter one
  (196 aa) by a C-terminal extension of 18 aa (Beckmann et al. 1988, Ostman et al.
  1992). The PDGF-A chains are cleaved singly at the RRKR sequence at 86 position
  to yield predominantly, the secreted PDGF-AA forms, while PDGF-BB are reported that
  at least three forms of PDGF-BB can be formed (Seidah & Prat 2002). This includes
  an approx 24 kDa form retained intracellularly and degraded in lysosomes, a secreted
  approx 30 kDa form and an approx 40 kDa cell surface-associated form. PDGF-B is
  processed at the 'RGRR' sequence at position 81 and a second clevage close to residues
  'ARPVT' at position 190 (Siegfried et al. 2005, Ostman et al. 1992, Heldin & Westermark
  1999).
