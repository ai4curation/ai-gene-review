display_name: Receptor ACKR2 binds most inflammatory CC chemokines
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2, CCBP2, D6) is a promiscuous chemokine
  receptor which has no known signalling function and is therefore considered to be
  a 'silent' or 'scavenger' receptor. ACKR2 negatively regulates inflammatory responses
  by binding CC chemokines, targeting them for degradation following receptor internalization
  (Fra et al. 2003, Bonecchi et al. 2004, Graham & Locati 2013).
