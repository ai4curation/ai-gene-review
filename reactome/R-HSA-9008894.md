summary: 'Tyrosine protein phosphatase non receptors (PTPNs) are a family of enzymes
  that act in coordination with protein tyrosine kinases to control various signalling
  pathways downstream. This event represents the transcription and translation of
  the PTPN set comprising the members: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20 and
  23. This event is positively regulated by IL-37b(? 218):SMAD3 and promotes dephosphorylation
  and suppression of the activation of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling
  pathways such as ERK, p38 MAPK, JNK, PI3K, NF-κB, and STAT3 pathways. (Luo et al.,

This event represents the transcription and translation of the PTPN set comprising the members: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20 and 23.
