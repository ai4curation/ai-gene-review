display_name: PHF20 binds TP53 dimethylated on K370 and K382
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PHF20 binds TP53 (p53) dimethylated at lysine residues K370 and K382 by unidentified
  protein lysine methyltransferase(s). PHF20 binding interferes with MDM2 binding
  to TP53, thus resulting in TP53 stabilization (Cui et al. 2012).
