display_name: USP7 deubiquitinates monoubiquitinated PTEN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: USP7 (HAUSP) deubiquitinates monoubiquitinated nuclear PTEN, thus promoting
  relocalization of PTEN to the cytosol. USP7-mediated deubiquitination of PTEN is
  negatively regulated by PML in the presence of DAXX, but the exact mechanism has
  not been elucidated (Song et al. 2008).
