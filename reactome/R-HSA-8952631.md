display_name: AcM-UBE2M transfers NEDD8 to CRL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: UBE2M transfers NEDD8 to lysine 712 of CUL3 in the E3 ligase complex (Hori
  et al, 1999; Duda et al, 2008). Neddylation increases the ubiquitin ligase activity
  of the E3 complex towards its targets, and prevents binding of the CUL3 complex
  with the CAND1 inhibitor (Hori et al, 1999; Duda et al, 2008). CRL3 ubiquitin ligase
  complexes target substrates through a BTB substrate recognition protein, and regulate
  processes such as development and stress response, as well as viral replication
  (reviewed in Genschik et al, 2013; Mahon et al, 2014).

## Summary

UBE2M transfers NEDD8 to lysine 712 of CUL3 in the E3 ligase complex (Hori et al, 1999; Duda et al, 2008). Neddylation increases the ubiquitin ligase activity of the E3 complex towards its targets, and prevents binding of the CUL3 complex with the CAND1 inhibitor (Hori et al, 1999; Duda et al, 2008). CRL3 ubiquitin ligase complexes target substrates through a BTB substrate recognition protein, and regulate processes such as development and stress response, as well as viral replication (reviewed in Genschik et al, 2013; Mahon et al, 2014).
