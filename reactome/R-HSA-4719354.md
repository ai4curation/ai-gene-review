display_name: Defective DPM3 does not transfer mannose to DOLP to form DOLPman
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase (DPM), a heterotrimeric protein embedded
  in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, mediates the transfer of mannose (from cytosolic
  GDP-mannose) to dolichyl phosphate (DOLP) to form dolichyl-phosphate-mannose (DOLPman).
  The first subunit of the heterotrimer (DPM1) appears to be the actual catalyst,
  and the other two subunits (DPM2 and 3) appear to stabilise it (Maeda et al. 2000).
  Defects in DPM3 can cause congenital disorder of glycosylation 1o (DPM3-CDG, CDG1o;
  MIM:612937), a multisystem disorder caused by a defect in glycoprotein biosynthesis
  and characterised by under-glycosylated serum glycoproteins. CDG type 1 diseases
  result in a wide variety of clinical features, such as defects in the nervous system
  development, psychomotor retardation, dysmorphic features, hypotonia, coagulation
  disorders, and immunodeficiency (Lefeber et al. 2009). Normally, the DPM3 subunit
  tethers the catalytic DPM1 subunit to the ER membrane. A homozygous 254T-C transition
  in the DPM3 gene results in a leu85-to-ser (L85S) substitution in a highly conserved
  residue in the coiled-coil domain. This mutant shows a reduced binding capacity
  to DPM1 which vastly reduces dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase activity and
  therefore little or no DOLPman is formed (Lefeber et al. 2009).
