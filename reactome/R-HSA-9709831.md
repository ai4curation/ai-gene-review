## Summary

During viral infection, cytosolic viral RNA triggers activation of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and the formation of MAVS signalosome (Kawai T et al. 2005; Seth RB et al. 2005; Xu LG et al. 2005). Activated MAVS recruits TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7 to the mitochondria leading to the activation of IRF3/IRF7 and subsequent production of type I interferons (Kawai T et al. 2005; Seth RB et al. 2005; Xu LG et al. 2005).<p>Co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that both TBK1 and IRF3 associated with heat shock protein 90kDa (HSP90), which facilitated signal transduction from TBK1 to IRF3 in Sendai virus (SeV)-infected human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells (Yang K et l. 2006). MAVS, TBK1 and IRF3 were found to associate with mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM70 (TOMM70) in HEK293 cells (Liu XY et al. 2010). TOMM70 localizes on the outer membrane of the mitochondria to mediate the translocation of mitochondrial protein precursors from the cytosol into the mitochondria (reviewed in Fan AC & Young JC 2011; Sokol AM et al. 2014; Kreimendahl S & Rassow J 2020).
