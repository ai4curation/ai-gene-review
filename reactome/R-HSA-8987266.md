## Summary

IFNL1 can induce phosphorylation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta (STAT1), Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) , Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) , Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) ,Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) (Dumoutier et al. 2004, Novak et al. 2008), Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2)(Dickensheets et al. 2013), Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) (Dumoutier et al. 2004). 
This is a black-box event because direct evidence for STAT4 and 5-binding and activation is lacking. STAT binding is inferred from subsequent phosphorylation in response to IFNL1 (Jordan et al. 2007).
