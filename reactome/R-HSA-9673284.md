display_name: GTP-bound RAC1 contributes to MAPK8 activation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) activation was described
  as essential for p75NTR to induce MAPK8 (aka JNK) and apoptosis in cortical oligodendrocytes
  (Bazenet et al. 1998). The simultaneous activation of TRKA counteracts the apoptotic
  action of p75, by modulating the kinetics of p75-mediated RAC activation.
