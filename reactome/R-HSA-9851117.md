display_name: NPM1-ALK- and p-STAT3-dependent IRF4 gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT3 binds to the IRF4 promoter downstream of NPM-ALK to promote IRF4 gene
  expression (Bandini et al, 2018; Marzec et al, 2013; Piva et al, 2010; Kasprzycka
  et al, 2006; Durant et al, 2010).  IRF4 is a member of the interferon regulatory
  factor family of transcription factors that is expressed in immune cells response
  to activation of T-cell or B-cell receptors, IL-4 and CD40 signaling (reviewed in
  Wong et al, 2022). IRF4 expression downstream of NPM-ALK signaling is required for
  proliferation and survival, possibly through induction of MYC gene expression (Bandini
  et al, 2018; Weilemann et al, 2015).
