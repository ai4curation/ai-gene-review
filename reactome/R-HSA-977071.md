display_name: ST6GAL1 transfers sialic acid to Tn antigens to form sTn antigens
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1) transfers sialic
  acid (Neu5Ac) from the donor CMP-Neu5Ac to galactose-containing acceptor substrates
  such as Tn antigens (Stamenkovic et al. 1990, Marcos et al. 2004). The resultant
  sialyl Tn antigens are highly expressed in several human carcinomas and are associated
  with carcinoma aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Sewell et al. 2006, Lakshmanan
  et al. 2021).
