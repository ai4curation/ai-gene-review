stable_id: R-HSA-186778
display_name: SHP2 binds to the active receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2C (SHP2) is ubiquitously expressed and has
  two SH2 domains, both of which need to be bound to phosphorylated tyrosine residues
  for full activation of catalytic activity. SHP-2 binds with high affinity to Tyr
  1009 of the PDGF beta-receptor and with lower affinity to Tyr 763; it also binds
  to the alpha-receptor and Tyr 720 in the interkinase domain has been implicated
  in this binding. <br>The phosphatase is able to dephosphorylate autophosphorylated
  PDGF receptors and substrates for PDGF receptors so SHP2 can be thought of as a
  negative regulator of signaling from PDGF receptors. SHP2 may be involved in positive
  signaling by binding Grb2/Sos1 and dephosphorylating the COOH-terminal tyrosine
  of Src, factors important for Src activation.
