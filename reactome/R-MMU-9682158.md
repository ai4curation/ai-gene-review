display_name: Csf1r-associated Plcg2 hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine yielding choline
  phosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol
species: Mus musculus
summary: In response to Csf1, Plcg2 (phospholipase C gamma2) associates with Csf1r,
  is activated by phosphorylation, and hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to yield choline
  phosphate (ChoP, phosphocholine) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (Xu et al. 1993, Bourgin-Hierle
  et al. 2008). Plcg2 activates pathways that enhance differentiation of macrophages
  (Bourette et al. 1997).
