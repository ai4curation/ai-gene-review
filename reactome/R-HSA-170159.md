stable_id: R-HSA-170159
display_name: Translocation of Cdc25 to the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The localization of the Cdc25A, B and C proteins is dynamic involving the
  shuttling of these proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Sequences in
  these proteins mediate both nuclear export and import (Kallstrom  et al., 2005;
  Lindqvist et al., 2004; Graves et al, 2001; Takizawa and Morgan, 2000).
