stable_id: R-HSA-904830
display_name: SLC40A1:CP:6Cu2+ transports Fe2+ from cytosol to extracellular region
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SLC40A1 (MTP1 aka ferroportin or IREG1) is highly expressed on macrophages
  where it mediates iron efflux from the breakdown of haem (Schimanski et al. 2005).
  SLC40A1 colocalizes with ceruloplasmin (CP) which stablizes SLC40A1 and is necessary
  for the efflux reaction to occur (Texel et al. 2008). Six copper ions are required
  as cofactor. Ceruloplasmin (CP) also catalyses the conversion of iron from ferrous
  (Fe2+) to ferric form (Fe3+), thereby assisting in its transport in the plasma in
  association with transferrin, which can only carry iron in the ferric state. As
  well as being expressed on macrophages, SLC40A1 is also highly expressed in the
  duodenum, placenta (where it may mediate the transport of iron from maternal to
  foetal circulation), muscle and spleen.
