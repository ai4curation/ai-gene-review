stable_id: R-HSA-5623519
display_name: RAB3IP and RAB8A bind to the ciliary targeting complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAB8A is another small GTPase that is required for ciliogenesis. RAB8A is
  recruited to the ciliary targeting complex at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) through
  interactions of the RAB8A guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RAB3IP (also
  known as RABIN8) with ASAP1 and RAB11 (Wang et al, 2012; Westlake et al, 2011; Feng
  et al, 2012; reviewed in Deretic, 2013). RAB8A is recruited in the inactive GDP
  bound form, and is activated at the TGN by RAB3IP in a RAB11A-dependent fashion
  (Hatulla et al, 2002; Knodler et al, 2010; Westlake et al, 2012; Wang et al, 2012;
  Feng et al, 2012).
