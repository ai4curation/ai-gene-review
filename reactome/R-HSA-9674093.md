stable_id: R-HSA-9674093
display_name: PDGFRs bind type I TKI
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Wild-type PDGFRA and PDGFRB  can be bound and inhibited by class I tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors including pazopanib, avapritinib, and crenolanib (Gril et al,
  2013; Wang et al, 2014; Mathias et al, 2015; Meliau et al, 2017; reviewed in Klug
  et al, 2018). Type I inhibitors bind in the ATP binding site of the active conformation
  and prevent full activation of the kinase (reviewed in Roskoski, 2018).
