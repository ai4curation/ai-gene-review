display_name: mTORC2 phosphorylates AKT1 on serine-473
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Suppression of the RICTOR subunit of the mTORC2 complex blocks flow-induced
  phosphorylation of serine-473 of AKT1 (Jin et al. 2021). The mTORC2 complex has
  been shown to directly phosphorylate AKT1 (Sarbassov et al. 2005). mTORC2 is likely
  activated by PI3K signaling as PI3K activity is required for phosphorylation of
  serine-473 of AKT1 in response to shear flow stress (Jin et al. 2021). AKT1 phosphorylated
  on serine-308 and serine-473 is located at the plasma membrane at cell-cell junctions
  in endothelial cells experiencing unidirectional laminar shear stress, but it is
  perinuclear in cells experiencing disturbed flow (Melchior and Frangos 2014).
