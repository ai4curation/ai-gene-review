species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ADAM (A disintegrin and metalloprotease domain) family are membrane-anchored
  metalloproteases that mediate the proteolytic cleavage of many transmembrane proteins
  within their extracellular regions. This so-called ectodomain shedding plays an
  important role in many cell and developmental processes. ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and
  Metalloproteinase 10) has been identified as the major physiological alpha-secretase
  in neurons (Lammich et al. 1999, Kuhn et al. 2010), responsible for cleaving amyloid
  precursor protein (APP) in a non-amyloidogenic manner and producing APPs-alpha,
  a neuroprotective APP-derived peptide.<p>The trafficking of ADAM10 is regulated
  by a subgroup of the tetraspanin superfamily referred to as TspanC8 tetraspanins.
  TSPAN4, 14, 15 and 33 are thought to mediate ADAM10 exit from the ER and transport
  to the plasma membrane in a variety of ways (Noy et al. 2016, Jouannet et al. 2016).
