## Summary

Constitutive phosphorylation of SHC1 was directly demonstrated in cells expressing EGFR L858R mutant (Greulich et al. 2005). Other EGFR cancer mutants were not directly tested for their ability to phosphorylate SHC1, but are assumed to interact with SHC1 in the same way as the wild-type EGFR protein.
