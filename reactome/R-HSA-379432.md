stable_id: R-HSA-379432
display_name: SLC7A9:SLC3A1 exchanges L-Arg, CySS-, L-Lys for L-Leu
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SLC7A9 as a heterodimer with SLC3A1 in the plasma membrane mediates the exchange
  of arginine (L-Arg), lysine (L-Lys), or cystine (CySS-) for leucine (L-Leu) and
  other neutral amino acids. The physiological concentrations of these amino acids
  favor neutral amino acid export and arginine/lysine/cystine import. Defects in SLC7A9
  and SLC3A1 cause cystinuria. In the body, this transport process is prominent in
  the kidney (Mizoguchi et al. 2001).
