display_name: 'RAF is phosphorylated downstream of oncogenic RAS '
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In many cancer types, RAF1 (also known as CRAF) appears to be a critical
  initial effector of the ERK pathway downstream of activated RAS and also mediates
  pathway activation in the presence of WT BRAF plus BRAF inhibitors (Rushworth et
  al, 2006; Dumaz et al, 2006; Garnett et al, 2005; Karreth et al, 2011; Poulikakos
  et al, 2010; Heidorn et al, 2010; Roring et al, 2012; reviewed in Samatar et al,
  2014; Lito et al, 2013). This activation depends largely on heterodimerization with
  BRAF, although homodimers also contribute (Weber et al, 2001; Rushworth et al, 2006).
  Activation of RAF downstream of mutant RAS appears to require full phosphorylation
  of the N-region and the activation loop, unlike the case in BRAF mutant cells, where
  RAF N-loop phosphorylation is dispensable (Garnett et al, 2005).
