display_name: VEGFA gene expression is inhibited by the TFAP2A homodimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Binding of TFAP2A (AP-2 alpha) dimer to AP-2 response elements in the VEGFA
  gene promoter results in repression of VEGFA expression (Ruiz et al. 2004). CITED2,
  a transcription co-factor of TFAP2A, also represses VEGFA transcription, but the
  mechanism has not been established (Li et al. 2012).
