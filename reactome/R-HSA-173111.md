display_name: Disassembly of viral capsid
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The HIV capsid protein (p24) surrounds the viral genome and associated proteins
  to make up the viral core.  Dissolution of the viral capsid allows for release of
  the viral RNA and other proteins such as Vpr into the cytoplasm, which will subsequently
  form the Reverse Transcription Complex.  Dissolution of capsid proteins may be caused
  by interaction with cellular proteins, e.g. TRIM5, or may occur in a similar fashion
  to that of matrix dissolution; as a reaction to a change in pH.  Indeed, studies
  observing capsid assembly and conformation show that this protein-protein interaction
  is heavily influenced by even small changes in pH (pH7.0 to 6.8).
