display_name: Defective ACTH does not bind MCR2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, POMC(138-176)) stimulates the adrenal
  glands, via its binding to adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor (MC2R) and subsequent
  downstream signaling, to release cortisol, a glucocorticoid released in response
  to stress whose primary functions are to stimulate gluconeogenesis, suppress the
  immune system and aid metabolism of fats, proteins and carbohydrates.<br><br>Defects
  in ACTH can cause obesity (MIM:601665) resulting in excessive accumulation of body
  fat. Defects in ACTH can also cause pro-opiomelanocortinin deficiency (POMCD; MIM:609734)
  where affected individuals present early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency and
  red hair. Mutations causing POMCD include E79*, R236G and L25* (Krude et al. 1998,
  Challis et al. 2003, Krude et al. 2003).
