stable_id: R-HSA-9817575
display_name: ERO1B oxidizes P4HB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ERO1B catalyzes the reduction of the disulfide bond in HC53,56-P4HB to form
  P4HB plus H2O2 (Gross et al. 2006; Mezghrani et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2011). Studies
  of knockout mutant mice are consistent with this role for ERO1B, while also suggesting
  that other oxidoreductases, not annotated here, could play a role in this process
  in vivo (Zito et al. 2010a b). See also the review of oxidative protein folding
  by Hudson et al. (2015).
