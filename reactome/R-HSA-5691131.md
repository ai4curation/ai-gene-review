display_name: CANDI binds CUL1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cullin-associated NEDD8-dissociated protein 1 (CANDI, TIP120) is a key assembly
  factor of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, acting as
  a F-box protein exchange factor. CANDI binds cullin-1 (CUL1), preventing its association
  with SKP1 thereby disrupting the formation of SCF complexes. Neddylated CUL1 prevents
  CANDI binding (Zheng et al. 2002, Goldenberg et al. 2004).
