display_name: Biosynthesis of aspirin-triggered D-series resolvins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The D-series resolvins (RvD1-6) are biosynthesised from the precursor ω-3
  fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), either via the lipoxygenase pathway (17(S)-RvDs)
  or via aspirin-triggered cylcooxygenase catalysis (described here) forming the epimeric
  17(R)-RvD1-6 resolvins (Serhan et al. 2014, Bannenberg & Serhan 2010).
