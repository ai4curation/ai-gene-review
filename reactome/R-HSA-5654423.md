display_name: Activated FGFR4:p-SHC1 binds GRB2:SOS1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylated SHC1 links FGFR to Grb2 (Klint et al. 1995) leading to the
  formation of a signaling complex including Shc, Grb2 and Sos. Transformation of
  NIH 3T3 cells with v-Src produced a strong constitutive association of FGFR1 with
  Shc, Grb2 and Sos (Curto et al. 1998) suggesting Src involvement. Recruitment of
  Grb2-Sos links FGFR to the Ras pathway.
