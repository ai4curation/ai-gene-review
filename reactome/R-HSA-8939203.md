display_name: HSP90-dependent ATP hydrolysis promotes release of ESR:ESTG from chaperone
  complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Release of the estrogen receptor from the chaperone complex requires requires
  HSP90-dependent ATP hydrolysis, and occurs at the same rate in the presence and
  absence of ligand (Smith et al, 1992; Smith et al, 1993; Aumais et al, 1997; Grenert
  et al, 1997; Obermann et al, 1998; Panaretou et al, 1998; reviewed in Smith and
  Toft, 2008). In the absence of ligand, released ERs are recaptured by HSP40 through
  its interaction with the ligand binding domain (LBD), priming reassembly of the
  chaperone complex. Ligand binding may result in the loss of the HSP40-binding site,
  allowing the receptor to escape repetitive rounds of chaperone complex assembly,
  and freeing it for DNA-binding (reviewed in Smith and Toft, 2008).
