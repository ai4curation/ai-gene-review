summary: Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA), ones with more than 20 carbon atoms,
  have diverse physiological roles, notably as components of ceramides in membrane
  lipids and as precursors of the eicosanoid hormones that play central roles in the
  generation and resolution of inflammatory responses. Saturated and monounsaturated
  VLCFAs can be synthesized by elongation of palmitic acid synthesized de novo or
  derived from the diet. Polyunsaturated VLCFAs are synthesized from dietary linoleic
  and linolenic acids - humans lack the desaturase enzymes to synthesize these molecules
  from stearate.<p>Chemically, the elongation process that yields VLCFA parallels
  the one by which palmitate (16 carbons) or stearate (18 carbons) are synthesized
  de novo from acetate. The starting fatty acid is activated by conjugation with coenzyme
  A (CoA-SH), condensed with malonyl-CoA to form a 3-oxoacyl CoA containing two more
  carbon atoms than the starting long chain fatty acyl CoA and CO2, reduced with NADPH
  to a 3-hydroxyacyl CoA, dehydrated to a trans 2,3-enoyl-CoA, and reduced with NADPH
  to yield a fatty acyl-CoA two carbons longer than the starting one.<p>The process
  differs from the de novo one in that the enzymatic activities resposible for each
  step are expressed by different proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum
  membrane, not by separate domains of a single multifunctional cytosolic protein.
  In humans, activation is catalyzed by one of five acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain
  (ACSL) enzymes, conjugation by one of seven elongation of very long chain fatty
  acids (ELOVL) proteins, reduction by one of two HSB17B estradiol dehydrogenases,
  dehydration by one of four protein tyrosine phosphatase-like / 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
  dehydratase (PTPL / HACD) proteins, and reduction by one of two trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA
  reductase (TECR) proteins. Members of the four enzyme families differ in their tissue-specific
  expression patterns and in their substrate preferences (chain length, degree of
  saturation), leading to tissue-specific complements of VLCA (Jakobsson et al. 2006;
