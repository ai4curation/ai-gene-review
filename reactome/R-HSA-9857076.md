display_name: Oxidized DNAJA1 binds HSPA1A,B (HSP70) displacing HSF1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Oxidized DNAJA1 and, possibly, mitochondrial proteins stranded in the cytosol
  bind to HSPA1A or HSPA1B (HSP70) (Sutandy et al. 2023). In unstressed cells, HSPA1A,B
  is bound to HSF1. The binding of other proteins to HSPA1A,B causes dissociation
  of HSF1 (Sutandy et al. 2023), which is activated by phosphorylation, translocation
  to the nucleus, and trimerization (Baler et al. 1993).
