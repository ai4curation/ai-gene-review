display_name: SYK autophosphorylates at the activated BCR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The SYK protein tyrosine kinase autophosphorylates at tyrosines 131, 323,
  348, 352, 525, and 526 (Law et al. 1994, Rowley et al. 1995, Baldock et al. 2000,
  Irish et al. 2006, Papp et al. 2007, Chen et al. 2008, Tsang et al. 2008). The autophosphorylation
  increases the kinase activity of SYK. SYK is also phosporylated on additional residues
  in response to BCR activation (Bohnenberger et al. 2011).
