species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Synaptojanin (SYNJ) 1 and 2 are inositol-5-phosphatases that sequentially
  convert PI(4,5)P2 to PI(4)P and PI (Cremona et al 1999; reviewed in Billcliff and
  Lowe, 2014).  Conversion of PI(4,5)P2 to PI(4)P and PI accompanies maturation of
  the clathrin-coated pit, and consistent with this, SYNJ proteins are recruited to
  the clathrin-coated pit through interactions with a number of endocytic proteins
  including ITSNs, EPS15, PACSIN proteins and endophilins, as well as with clathrin
  and AP-2 (Haffner et al, 1997; Cestra et al, 1999; Maire et al, 2004; Schuske et
  al, 2003; Verstreken et al, 2003; Modregger et al, 2000; Perera et al 2006; Milosevic
  et al, 2011; reviewed in Dittman and Ryan, 2009). SYJN1 exists in two isoforms,
  a longer 170 kDA isoform and a shorter 145 kDA isoform, with slightly different
  roles. The recruitment and activity of SYNJ1-145 appears to largely coincide with
  that of dynamin at later stages of vesicle formation, while the SYNJ1-170 isoform
  also plays earlier roles in stabilizing the growing clathrin-coated vesicle (Perera
  et al, 2006; Taylor et al, 2011; Antonescu et al, 2011).  SYNJ-mediated hydrolysis
  of PI(4,5)P2 to PI(4)P is most efficient on highly curved, endophilin-coated tubules
  of the vesicle neck and contributes to dynamin-mediated membrane scission (Chang-Ileto

## Summary

Synaptojanin (SYNJ) 1 and 2 are inositol-5-phosphatases that sequentially convert PI(4,5)P2 to PI(4)P and PI (Cremona et al 1999; reviewed in Billcliff and Lowe, 2014).  Conversion of PI(4,5)P2 to PI(4)P and PI accompanies maturation of the clathrin-coated pit, and consistent with this, SYNJ proteins are recruited to the clathrin-coated pit through interactions with a number of endocytic proteins including ITSNs, EPS15, PACSIN proteins and endophilins, as well as with clathrin and AP-2 (Haffner et al, 1997; Cestra et al, 1999; Maire et al, 2004; Schuske et al, 2003; Verstreken et al, 2003; Modregger et al, 2000; Perera et al 2006; Milosevic et al, 2011; reviewed in Dittman and Ryan, 2009).
