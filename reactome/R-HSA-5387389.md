stable_id: R-HSA-5387389
display_name: Hh processing variants are translocated to the cytosol in a VCP-dependent
  manner
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Depletion of the ATPase VCP results in the stabilization of processing-defective
  Hh variants in the ER lumen, supporting the notion that, as is the case for the
  WT Hh C-terminal fragment, these peptides are also substrates for ERAD (Chen et
  al, 2011; Huang et al, 2013).

## Summary

Depletion of the ATPase VCP results in the stabilization of processing-defective Hh variants in the ER lumen, supporting the notion that, as is the case for the WT Hh C-terminal fragment, these peptides are also substrates for ERAD (Chen et al, 2011; Huang et al, 2013).
