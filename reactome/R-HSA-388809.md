display_name: CTLA-4 binds B7-1/B7-2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CTLA4 binds to B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) with a significantly higher affinity
  than CD28, allowing it to outcompete CD28 for these ligands and inhibit T cell activation
  (van der Merwe et al. 1997). This interaction is strengthened by the dimerization
  of CTLA4, which increases the avidity for B7 molecules (Schwartz et al. 2001). Beyond
  simply blocking co-stimulation, CTLA4 engagement actively promotes regulatory T
  cell induction and suppresses effector T cell responses. Additionally, CTLA4's localization
  to the immunological synapse, regulated by intracellular trafficking, ensures its
  rapid accumulation upon T cell activation, enhancing its inhibitory effect on immune
  responses (Egen et al. 2002).
