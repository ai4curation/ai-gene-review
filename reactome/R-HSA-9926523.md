display_name: MITF-M-dependent SOX2 gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Global expression and DNA binding analysis suggests that the SOX2 gene is
  a target of MITF-M-dependent repression in melanoma cells (Dilshat et al, 2021;
  Laurette et al, 2015). SOX2 is a transcriptional repressor that is present on the
  promoter of the MITF gene in neural crest cells prior to melanocyte fate specification.
  With FOXD3, SOX2 represses MITF expression and promotes instead the development
  of the Schwann cell precursor fate (Adameyko et al, 2012). Although the mechanisms
  for lifting SOX2-mediated repression in the melanocyte cell line are not known,
  once expressed, MITF itself represses further SOX2 expression (Adameyko et al, 2012;
  reviewed in Mort et al, 2015; Goding and Arnheiter, 2019). Although SOX2 is upregulated
  in many cancers, its role in tumor progression in melanoma is not entirely clear
