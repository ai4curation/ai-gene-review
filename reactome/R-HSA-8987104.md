display_name: IL20:IL20RA:JAK1:IL20RB:p‑JAK2,p‑JAK3 binds STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)and STAT5 are believed
  to bind the receptor complex following the phosphorylation of JAK2 and JAK3 within
  the IL20:IL20RA receptor complex, because Interleukin-20 (IL20) stimulation leads
  to STAT3 nuclear translocation (Blumberg et al. 2001, Parrish-Novak et a. 2002)).
  Phosphorylation of STAT5 at Tyr-694 has been observed in response to IL20 but it
  is not clear which IL20 receptor was involved (Tritsaris et al. 2007). This is a
  black box event because there is no direct evidence of STAT3 or STAT5 binding, which
  is inferred to be a prerequisite for STAT phosphorylation in response to IL20.
