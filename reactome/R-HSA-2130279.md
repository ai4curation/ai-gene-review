display_name: Association of beta-catenin with the RBX1:SCF(beta-TrCP1) ubiquitin
  ligase complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: B-TrCP associates with phosphorylated beta-catenin through the B-TrCP WD40
  repeat region. Currently, it is unclear whether the ubiquitin ligase binds beta-catenin
  after it leaves the complex. It is equally possible that it binds beta-catenin while
  beta-catenin is still bound to Axin.
