display_name: Calcium Binds Caldesmon
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Caldesmon functions in an analogous fashion to troponin in striated muscle.
  Once calcium has entered the smooth muscle cell, calcium levels slowly rise. Caldesmon
  binds calcium, freeing tropomyosin, allowing the tropomyosin to move exposing the
  active sites on actin for myosin binding.
