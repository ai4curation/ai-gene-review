stable_id: R-HSA-9701534
display_name: p-Y705, S727 STAT3 dimer binds HIF1A gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT3 binds to the HIF1A promoter as assessed by ChIP in NPM-ALK cells. HIF1A
  expression in turn induces VEGF, which contributes to angiogenesis (Marzec et al,
  2011; Martinengo et al, 2014; reviewed in Werner et al, 2017)
