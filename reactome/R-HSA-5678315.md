display_name: BECN1 complex, p-AMBRA1 dissociate from DYNLL1,DYNLL2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation of AMBRA1 by ULK1 leads to the release of the Beclin-1 complex
  from the dynein motor complex, allowing it to relocalize and initiate autophagosome
  nucleation (Di Bartolomeo et al. 2010).
