display_name: FEN1 bound to PCNA and APEX1 cleaves flap ssDNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'PCNA-bound FEN1 acts as a flap endonuclease to cleave the displaced single
  strand DNA (flap) containing the oxidatively damaged AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic)
  dideoxyribose residue (5''ddRP) that could not be excised by POLB. Interaction between
  FEN1 and PCNA or FEN1 and APE1 facilitate cleavage of flap structures (Klungland
  and Lindahl 1997, Matsumoto et al. 1999, Dianov et al. 1999). '

## Summary

PCNA-bound FEN1 acts as a flap endonuclease to cleave the displaced single strand DNA (flap) containing the oxidatively damaged AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) dideoxyribose residue (5'ddRP) that could not be excised by POLB. Interaction between FEN1 and PCNA or FEN1 and APE1 facilitate cleavage of flap structures (Klungland and Lindahl 1997, Matsumoto et al. 1999, Dianov et al. 1999).
