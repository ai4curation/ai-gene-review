display_name: RUNX1 and GATA1 bind the promoter of the THBS1 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The RUNX1:CBFB complex can bind to the promoter of the THBS1 (TSP-1) gene,
  encoding Thrombospondin-1. Based on the analogy with the ITGA2B gene transcription
  (Zhao et al. 2008), the PRMT1-mediated arginine-methylation increases transcriptional
  activity of the RUNX1:CBFB complex at the THBS1 promoter (Herglotz et al. 2013).
  In addition to the RUNX1:CBFB complex, the complex of GATA1 and ZFPM1 (FOG1) (Freson
  et al. 2003) is also recruited to the THBS1 promoter (Herglotz et al. 2013), likely
  through the interaction between GATA1 and RUNX1 (Elagib et al. 2003). The zinc finger
  domain of GATA1 is involved in binding to RUNX1 (Xu et al. 2006). Along with RUNX1
  and GATA1, histone acetyltransferases p300 (EP300) and PCAF (KAT2B), as well as
  the WDR5-containing histone methyltransferase MLL complex are also recruited to
  the THBS1 promoter. Dimethylation of histone H3 on lysine residue K4 (K5 when taking
  into account the initiator methionine), known as the H3K4me2 mark, is characteristic
  of nucleosomes associated with megakaryocyte promoters prior to the onset of differentiation
  (Herglotz et al. 2013) and is assumed to be present at the THBS1 promoter.
