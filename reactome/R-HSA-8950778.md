summary: Cell stimulation by Interleukin-12 (IL12) leads to formation of Signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) dimers but not heterodimers with STAT1
  or STAT3 (Naeger et al. 1999).<br>STAT4 is required to mediate IL12 effects and
  is crucial for T cell helper 1 (Th1) development and efficient Interferon gamma
  (IFNG) production, as shown by STAT4 knock-out studies (Kaplan et al. 1996, Thierfelder
  et al. 1996). STAT4 is activated by the interaction of IL12 with the interleukin-12
  receptor. The interaction of the STAT4 SH2 domain is specific for the peptide sequence
  pYLPSNID, which contains tyrosine 800 in the Interleukin-12 receptor beta 2 subunit
  (IL12RB2). This tyrosine is required for STAT4 DNA binding activity and transcriptional
  activation of the Interferon regulatory factor 1(IRF1) gene. <br><br>STAT4 is not
  capable of binding other peptide sequences at tyrosine residues 678 or 767 of IL12RB2
  and these peptides are not required for STAT4 activation. <br>The Interleukin-12
  receptor peptide sequence pYLPSNID appears to be a specific binding site for STAT4,
  other STATs, including STAT1, which has a closely related SH2 domain, do not recognize
  pYLPSNID peptides (Naeger et al. 1999).
