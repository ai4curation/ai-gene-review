display_name: IL13 binds IL13RA:TYK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The type II Interleukin-13 (IL13) receptor complex (IL13R2) forms with IL13
  binding to Interleukin-13 receptor alpha subunit 1 (IL13RA1), which is constitutively
  bound to Non-receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), followed by recruitment of  Interleukin-4
  receptor subunit alpha (IL4R), which is associated with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) (Wang
  et al. 2009).  IL13RA1 binds IL13 with low affinity (Kd = 2-10 nmol/L) (Miloux et
  al. 1997).
