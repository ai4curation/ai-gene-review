summary: The Early Growth Response (EGR) gene family includes EGR1-4 and WT1. These
  Cys2-His2 zinc finger transcription factors are immediate early genes (IEG) that
  are rapidly turned on downstream of a number of stimuli and regulate expression
  of genes involved in stress response and differentiation (reviewed in Pagel and
  Deindl, 2001; Bahrami and Drabløs, 2016).  Roles for EGR proteins are well established
  in the nervous system, with EGR target genes contributing to synaptic plasticity,
  long-term potentiation, peripheral nerve myelination and NGF-induced neurite outgrowth
  (reviewed in Perez-Cadahia et al, 2011; Herdegen and Leah, 1998; O'Donovan et al,
  1999).<br>Expression of EGR genes depends on binding of phosphorylated ternary complex
  factor (TCF) protein ELK1 and its transcriptional coactivator SRF (serum response
  factor) to their cognate DNA binding sequences in the promoters (Hooker et al, 2017;
  De Franco et al, 1993; Harada et al, 2001; reviewed in Herdegen and Leah, 1998).
  NGF-stimulated expression of EGR1 and 2 occurs downstream of sustained MAPK signaling
  (Millbrandt et al, 1987; Sukhatme et al, 1988; de Franco et al, 1998; Mullenbrock
  et al, 2011; Crosby et al, 1991; Lönn et al, 2005).  In addition to SRF and TCF
  binding sites, the EGR1 promoter also contain consensus binding sequences for AP-1
  and CREB, as well as binding sites for EGR1 protein itself (Schwachtgen et al, 2000;
  Thiel et al, 2000; Svaren et al, 1996; reviewed in Page; and Deindl, 2001). Expression
  of EGR1 is limited by a negative feedback loop mediated by the binding of a complex
  of EGR1 with a repressor protein of the NAB family (NGF1A binding protein) to the
  EGR1 binding site (Cao et al, 1990; Thiel et al, 2000; Svaren et al, 1996).
