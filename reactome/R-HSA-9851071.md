display_name: STAT3, DNMT1 and HDAC1 bind PTPN6 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT3, HDAC1 and DNMT1 bind to the PTPN6 promoter as assessed by electrophoretic
  mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Binding is
  mediated by interaction of active STAT3 with its cognate sites in the PTPN6 promoter
  (Zhang et al, 2005).<br>Binding of the STAT3:HDAC1:DNMT1 complex contributes to
  PTPN6 gene silencing in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and ALK+ T-cell lymphomase. DNMT1
  methyltransferase activity contributes to silencing by methylating CpG islands in
  the PTPN6 promoter; the exact role of HDAC1 has not been elucidated (Zhang et al,
  2005).
