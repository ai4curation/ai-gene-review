summary: Pathogen recognition is central to the induction of T cell differentiation.
  Groups of pathogens share similar structures known as pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs), which are recognised by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed
  on dendritic cells (DCs) to induce cytokine expression. PRRs include archetypical
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and non-TLRs such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like
  receptors, C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and intracellular nucleotide-binding domain
  and leucine-rich-repeat-containing family (NLRs). PRR recognition of PAMPs can lead
  to the activation of intracellular signalling pathways that elicit innate responses
  against pathogens and direct the development of adaptive immunity.<br>CLRs comprises
  a large family of receptors which bind carbohydrates, through one or more carbohydrate
  recognition domains (CRDs), or which possess structurally similar C-type lectin-like
  domains (CTLDs) which do not necessarily recognise carbohydrate ligands. Some CLRs
  can induce signalling pathways that directly activate nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB),
  whereas other CLRs affect signalling by Toll-like receptors. These signalling pathways
  trigger cellular responses, including phagocytosis, DC maturation, chemotaxis, the
  respiratory burst, inflammasome activation, and cytokine production.
