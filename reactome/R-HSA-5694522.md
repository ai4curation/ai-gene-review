display_name: Inner coat assembly and cargo binding
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SAR1:GTP recruits the cytoplasmic SEC23:SEC24 complex. SEC24, and to a lesser
  extent SEC23, also mediate interaction with COPII cargo, concentrating it into the
  emerging vesicle.  Transmembrane cargo may interact directly with the inner coat
  proteins, often in an isoform specific manner; alternately, some transmembrane proteins
  and all soluble cargo interact first with a cargo receptor of the p24, LMAN or ERV
  families.
