stable_id: R-HSA-9755757
display_name: SARS-CoV-2 N binds TAK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Several studies showed that viral RNA binding to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
  (N) protein induces liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (Wu Y et al. 2021; Wang
  S et al. 2021; Cubuk J et al. 2021; Lu S et al. 2021). Viral N protein:RNA LLPS
  recruits TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and IκB kinase (IKK) complexes and enhances
  their interaction which in turn promotes NF-kappaB activation and expression of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines (Wu Y et al. 2021). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of viral
  N is essential for LLPS (Wu Y et al. 2021; Wang S et al. 2021) and induction of
  NF-kappaB signaling in mammalian cells (Wu Y et al. 2021). Deletion of CTD abolished
  SARS-CoV-2 N LLPS and the recruitment of TAK1/IKK complexes. Co-immunoprecipitation
  analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 N protein interacted with the components of the
  TAK1 complex and the IKK complex, including TAK1, TAB1, TAB2, IKBKA (CHUK), IKBKB,
  and NEMO (IKBKG) upon co-expression in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells
  (Wu Y et al. 2021). Endogenous IKK and TAK1 immunoprecipitated together with N in
  human lung cancer Calu3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Immunofluorescence analysis
  further revealed the enhanced co-localization between N protein and IKBKB after
  SARS-CoV-2 infection in human hepatoma Huh7 cells. These data sugget that SARS-CoV-2
  N:RNA LLPS serves as a platform to enhance the interaction between TAK1 and IKK
  complexes promoting NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory responses (Wu Y et al. 2021).<br><br>
