summary: 'Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a low conductance
  chloride-selective channel that mediates the transport of chloride ions in human
  airway epithelial cells. Chloride ions plays a key role in maintaining homoeostasis
  of epithelial secretions in the lungs. Defects in CFTR can cause cystic fibrosis
  (CF; MIM:602421), a common generalised disorder in Caucasians affecting the exocrine
  glands. CF results in an ionic imbalance that impairs clearance of secretions, not
  only in the lung, but also in the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract and liver. Wide-ranging
  manifestations of the disease include chronic lung disease, exocrine pancreatic
  insufficiency, blockage of the terminal ileum, male infertility and salty sweat.<br><br>The
  most common mutation that causes CF is F508del (Kerem et al. 1989). Although more
