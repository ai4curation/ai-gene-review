display_name: RNase H-mediated degradation of the RNA strand of the -sssDNA:RNA duplex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The rate of RNase H cleavage is substantially lower than the rate of DNA
  synthesis (Kati et al. 1992), so the product of the combined DNA synthesis and RNA
  degradation events catalyzed by the RT heterodimer mediating minus-strand strong
  stop DNA (-sssDNA) synthesis is a DNA segment still duplexed with extended viral
  genomic RNA fragments. In vitro, other RT heterodimers bind the remaining RNA:DNA
  heteroduplexes and their RNase H domains further degrade the viral genomic RNA (Wisniewski
  et al. 2000a, b).
