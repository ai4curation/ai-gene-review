summary: Cellular iron homeostasis is maintained by the coordinate posttranscriptional
  regulation of iron metabolism genes. The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex comprising
  the F-box/LRR-repeat protein 5 (FBXL5) protein, S-phase kinase-associated protein
  1 (SKP1), cullin 1 (CUL1) and NEDD8. This complex targets iron-responsive element-binding
  protein 2 (IREB2) for proteasomal degradation in iron-replete cells (Vashisht et
  al. 2009, Salahudeen et al. 2009). Here, CUL1, FBXF5 and SKP1 bind.
