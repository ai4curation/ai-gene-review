species: Homo sapiens
summary: Regulation of epithelial chloride flux, which is defective in patients with
  cystic fibrosis, may be mediated by phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or protein
  kinase C (PKC). CFTR regulates both HCO(3)(-) secretion and HCO(3)(-) salvage in
  secretory epithelia.

## Summary

Regulation of epithelial chloride flux, which is defective in patients with cystic fibrosis, may be mediated by phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or protein kinase C (PKC). CFTR regulates both HCO(3)(-) secretion and HCO(3)(-) salvage in secretory epithelia.
