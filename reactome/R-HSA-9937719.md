display_name: ICT1 hydrolyzes the peptidyl-tRNA bond of the nascent polypeptide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ICT1 (MRPL58) hydrolyzes the peptidyl-tRNA bond (Richter et al. 2010, Feaga
  et al. 2016) in nascent proteins produced by ribosomes stalled on mRNAs that extend
  less than about 6 nucleotides beyond the A-site (Feaga et al. 2016). This class
  includes mRNAs that have no stop codon and therefore are translated to the 3'-most
  nucleotide. After hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA, the ribosomal subunits are separated
  and the mRNA is extracted by an uncharacterized mechanism.
