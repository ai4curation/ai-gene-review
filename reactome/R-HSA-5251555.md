stable_id: R-HSA-5251555
display_name: Expression of AXIN1 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AXIN1 was first identified as the product of the mouse gene fused and has
  since been shown to have a key role in the degradation of beta-catenin by the destruction
  complex (Zeng et al, 1997; reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2013).  Deletion, missense
  and nonsense mutations that lead to activated WNT signaling have been identified
  in the AXIN1 gene in human cancers, making AXIN1 a tumor suppressor gene (reviewed
  in Salahshor and Woodgett, 2005).
