summary: 'The formation of Interleukin-15/Interleukin-15 receptor alpha complexes
  (IL15:IL15RA or IL15: IL15Rα) on cell surfaces induce a trans-endosomal recycling
  of IL15 leading to the persistence of surface-bound IL15 due to the constant reappearance
  of IL15 on plasma membranes. This complex contributes to the long survival of T
  cells expressing IL15RA after IL15 withdrawal (Dubois et al. 2000). This is a black
  box event since the details of other potential receptors and proteins participating
  in this event, remain unclear. It is shown similar patterns for other interleukins
  (i.e: Interleukin-12, Chiaruttini et al. 2016).'

## Summary

The formation of Interleukin-15/Interleukin-15 receptor alpha complexes (IL15:IL15RA or IL15: IL15Rα) on cell surfaces induce a trans-endosomal recycling of IL15 leading to the persistence of surface-bound IL15 due to the constant reappearance of IL15 on plasma membranes. This complex contributes to the long survival of T cells expressing IL15RA after IL15 withdrawal (Dubois et al. 2000). This is a black box event since the details of other potential receptors and proteins participating in this event, remain unclear. It is shown similar patterns for other interleukins (i.e: Interleukin-12, Chiaruttini et al. 2016).
