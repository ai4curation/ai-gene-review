display_name: 26S- and NUB1-mediated degradation of NEDD8, UBD and their conjugates
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NUB1 mediates the 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of NEDD8, UBN (also
  known as FAT10) and their protein conjugates (Kamitani et al, 2001; Tanji et al,
  2005;Schmidtke et al, 2006; reviewed in Tanaka et al, 2012; Schmidtke et al, 2014).
  Unlike the case for ubiquitin, the NEDD8 moiety also seems to be subject to degradation
  along with its conjugated proteins.

## Summary

NUB1 mediates the 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of NEDD8, UBN (also known as FAT10) and their protein conjugates (Kamitani et al, 2001; Tanji et al, 2005;Schmidtke et al, 2006; reviewed in Tanaka et al, 2012; Schmidtke et al, 2014). Unlike the case for ubiquitin, the NEDD8 moiety also seems to be subject to degradation along with its conjugated proteins.
