display_name: SRC-1 bound to ARRB2 is not activated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated PAR1 can induce the formation of signalling complexes with a beta-arrestin
  scaffold. When  beta-arrestin-1 is incorporated this leads to Src and subsequent
  ERK activation. In contrast, complexes containing beta-arrestin-2 do not lead to
  Src and ERK activation.
