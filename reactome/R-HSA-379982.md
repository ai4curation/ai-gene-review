stable_id: R-HSA-379982
display_name: glutamine + tRNA(Gln) + ATP => Gln-tRNA(Gln) + AMP + pyrophosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: QARS (cytosolic glutaminyl tRNA synthetase) catalyzes the reaction of glutamine,
  tRNA(Gln), and ATP to form Gln-tRNA(Gln), AMP, and pyrophosphate. The enzyme, a
  class I tRNA synthetase, is found in the cell as a component of the mutienzyme aminoacyl-tRNA
  synthetase complex. The same gene encodes both the cytosolic and mitochondrial QARS
  enzymes (Lamour et al. 1994).
