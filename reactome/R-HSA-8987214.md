summary: Phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  is believed to dimerize after it dissociates from the Interleukin-24 (IL24) receptor
  complex. <br>This is a black box event because dimerization is inferred from STAT3
  dimerization in response to interleukin-10 (Niemand et al. 2003) and the observed
  translocation of STAT3 to the nucleus in response to IL24 (Parrish-Novak et al.
  2002). In several other cytokine signalling cascades a phosphorylated dimer is necessary
  for binding to DNA and gene transcription (Park et al. 2000).
