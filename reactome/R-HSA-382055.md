stable_id: R-HSA-382055
display_name: Grb7 binds to the active PDGF receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Grb7 an adapter protein contains a single SH2 domain, a pleckstrin homology
  (PH) domain, and a proline-rich region. Similar to Grb2, Grb7 interacts with phosphorylated
  tyrosines in pYXNX motifs, including Tyr716 and Tyr775 of the PDGF beta-receptor.
