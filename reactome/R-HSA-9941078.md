display_name: proHPSE dissociates from HS(6)-SDC1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The molecular mechanism underlying internalization of the proheparanase-syndecan
  complex, leading to heparanase processing and activation, is incompletely understood
  but is likely to include dissociation of the proheparanase:syndecan 1 complex, possibly
  caused by the low pH of the lysosome lumen (Shteingauz et al., 2014).

## Summary

The molecular mechanism underlying internalization of the proheparanase-syndecan complex, leading to heparanase processing and activation, is incompletely understood but is likely to include dissociation of the proheparanase:syndecan 1 complex, possibly caused by the low pH of the lysosome lumen (Shteingauz et al., 2014).
