summary: The presence of Nef accelerates endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of
  the transmembrane glycoprotein CD8. Nef facilitates a cascade of protein interactions
  that ultimately result in the degradation of internalized CD8 protein. The final
  set of protein interactions that direct Nef to the beta-subunit of the COPI coatomers
  are at this time unclear.<br>A number of sites within Nef are proposed to be required
  for CD8 down-regulation, the myristoylation signal and N-terminal anchor regions,
  the C-terminal flexible loop, and amino acid positions 57 to 58. Consistent with
  all reported Nef functions, the myristoylation signal was found to be essential
  for CD8 down-modulation. The flexible loop contains a dileucine-based internalization
  motif, which is flanked by acidic clusters and is involved in enhanced internalization
  of the Nef-CD4 complex.
