display_name: CDC25A dephosphorylates CCNA:CDK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activation of the cyclin A:Cdc2 complexes at mitosis requires the removal
  of the inhibitory phosphate groups on Cdc2 (CDK1). This dephosphorylation is achieved
  by the activity of the CDC25A phosphatase (Timofeev et al. 2009). CCNA:CDK1 was
  reported to suppress the expression of CDC25A to safeguard timely mitotic entry
  (Ng et al. 2023). CDC25A, CDC25B, and CDC25C are kept inactive during interphase
  and are activated at the G2/M transition (reviewed in Wolfe and Gould 2004). The
  peak activity of CDC25A precedes the one of CDC25B. While CDC25A activates both
  CCNA:CDK1 and CCNB:CDK1 complexes, CDC25B seems to be involved only in activation
  of CCNB:CDK1 (Timofeev et al. 2009).
