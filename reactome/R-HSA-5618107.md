summary: The molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) functions as a homodimer.
  Each HSP90 protomer contains three flexibly linked regions, the N-terminal ATP-binding
  domain (NTD), the middle domain, and the C-terminal dimerization domain (Prodromou
  C et al. 1997; Pearl LH and Prodromou C 2006). HSP90 dimer is rather a dynamic molecule
  and ATP binding and hydrolysis are associated with conformational changes (Obermann
  WM et al. 1998; Krukenberg KA et al. 2011; Li J & Buchner J 2013; Prodromou C 2012).
  The structures of the isolated yeast and human N-terminal domain (NTD) of HSP90
  bound to ATP, ADP and adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP, a non-hydrolysable analogue
  of ATP) suggest that nucleotides bind deep in the cleft of NTD in open apo state
  of HSP90 (Prodromou C et al.1997; Meyer P et al. 2003, 2004; Colombo G et al. 2008;
  Li J et al. 2012). The structural studies of NTD of human HSP90 with antitumor agent
  geldanamycin (that acts as an ADP/ATP mimetic) support the polar interactions in
  the binding pocket described for yeast Hsp90 and ADP or ATP (Stebbins CE et al.
  1997; Prodromou C et al.1997; Grenert JP et al. 1997). Once ATP is bound it helps
  to stabilize the closed ATP lid state, in which the gamma-phosphate of ATP provides
  a hydrogen bonding that promotes a stable association of the ATP lid with NTD. The
  association of ATP or AMP-PNP with NTD then stimulates structural changes in NTD.
  NMR analysis of human full-length HSP90 protein with and without ATP confirmed that
  ATP binding led to conformational changes in NTD (Karagöz GE et al. 2010). No structural
  changes were observed in the middle and C-terminal domains (Karagöz GE et al. 2010).  However,
  other studies suggest that ATP-dependent conformational changes occur both in NTD
  and in the middle domain of HSP90 (Ali MM et al. 2006; Prodromou C et al. 2000;
  Chadli A et al. 2000; Meyer P et al. 2003). The changes are likely to involve movements
  of the ATP lid segment within each N-terminal domain that locates over the bound
  ATP (Ali MM et al. 2006; Prodromou C et al. 2000; Chadli A et al. 2000). The movement
  of the lids exposes surface residues that are subsequently involved in transient
  dimerization of the N-terminal domains of HSP90 (Ali MM et al. 2006; Prodromou C
  et al. 2000; Chadli A et al. 2000). The subsequent conformational changes upon ATP
  binding are regulated by co-chaperone activities. For example, arrangement of the
  STIP1 domains in the complex seems to prevent the NTDs dimerization of HSP90 monomers
  and total closure of the HSP90 dimer that is required for an efficient HSP90-mediated
  ATP hydrolysis (Southworth DR & Agard DA 2011; Alvira S et al. 2014). Thus, ATP
  binding coupled to co-chaperone-mediated loading of client protein to HSP90 complex
  regulates ATPase activity of HSP90.
