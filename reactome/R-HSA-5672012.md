display_name: Beclin-1 complex phosphorylates PtdIns
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Beclin-1 complex (ATG14:PIK3C3:PIK3R4:BECN1) is essential for autophagosome
  formation (Matsunaga et al. 2009, 2010). PIK3C3 (VPS34), the catalytic component
  of this complex, is a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that phosphorylates
  phosphatidylinositol (PI) producing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). PIK3C3
  is essential for the early stages of autophagy and colocalizes strongly with early
  autophagosome markers (Axe et al. 2008). The role of PI3P in autophagosome formation
  is to recruit WIPI2b (Dooley et al. 2014) a member of the WIPI family (Proikas-Cezanne
  et al. 2004, 2015, Polson et al. 2010).
