display_name: Binding of GRB2:SOS1 complex to phosphorylated EGFRvIII
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Direct binding of GRB2:SOS1 complex to phosphorylated homodimers of EGFRvIII
  cancer mutant has not been tested. GRB2 binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues
  Y1068 and Y1086 (corresponding to Y1092 and Y1110, respectively, when counting from
  the first amino acid of the EGFR precursor, prior to cleavage of the 24-amino acid
  signal peptide at the N-terminus). Phosphorylation of Y1068 (i.e. Y1092) has been
  directly demonstrated in EGFRvIII mutant (Huang et al. 2007).
