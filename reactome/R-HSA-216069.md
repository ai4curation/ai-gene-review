display_name: Interaction of integrin alphaDbeta2 with fibrin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Integrin alphaDbeta2 is a member of the beta2 family. It is expressed poorly
  on peripheral blood leukocytes but strongly on macrophages. alphaDbeta2 has the
  ability to interact with multiple ligands, including many ECM proteins. The interaction
  of beta2 integrins with ligands is mediated by their I-domains of the alpha subunits.
  The alphaD I-domain mediates the interaction with the ECM protein fibrinogen.
