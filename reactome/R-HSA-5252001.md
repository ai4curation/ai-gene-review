stable_id: R-HSA-5252001
display_name: ATP1B4 binds SNW1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In fish, amphibian and avian species, ATP1B4 (aka X,K-ATPase subunit beta-m)  functions
  as a subunit of Na/K-ATPase, located in the plasma membrane. In mammals, this functionality
  is lost and ATP1B4 accumulates on the nuclear envelope where it can interact with
  SNW domain-containing protein 1 (SNW1 aka Ski-interacting protein, SKIP), a transcriptional
  regulator. This ATP1B4:SNW1 complex is able to modulate TGF-beta-mediated transcription
  by increasing mRNA levels of SMAD7, an inhibitor of TGF-beta signalling (Pestov
  et al. 2007).
