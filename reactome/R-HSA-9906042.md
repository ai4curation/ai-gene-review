display_name: TTC19 clears UQCRFS1 fragments from Complex III
species: Homo sapiens
summary: N-terminal cleavage fragments of UQCRFS1 are cleared by TTC19, stabilizing
  the final complex. The process was shown in mouse but the mechanism is unclear (Bottani
  et al., 2017; Fernandez-Vizarra & Zeviani, 2018). Defects in TTC19 cause mitochondrial
  complex III deficiency in human (Ghezzi et al., 2011; reviewed in Xuan et al., 2023).
