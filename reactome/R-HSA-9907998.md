summary: 'Components of the proteasome 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) lid PSMD7
  (ortholog of yeast Rpn8), PSMD12 (ortholog of yeast Rpn5), PSMD13 (ortholog of yeast
  Rpn9), and PSMD14 (ortholog of yeast Rpn11) bind to each other (reviewed in Tomko
  and Hochstrasser 2013). In human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, it was confirmed
  that human PSMD12 (Rpn5), PSMD7 (Rpn8), PSMD13 (Rpn9), and PSMD14 (Rpn11) form a
  complex (Bai et al. 2019). PSMD14 (Rpn11) is not required for the formation of a
  heterotrimer between PSMD12 (Rpn5), PSMD7 (Rpn8) and PSMD13 (Rpn9) (Bai et al. 2019). '

## Summary

Components of the proteasome 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) lid PSMD7 (ortholog of yeast Rpn8), PSMD12 (ortholog of yeast Rpn5), PSMD13 (ortholog of yeast Rpn9), and PSMD14 (ortholog of yeast Rpn11) bind to each other (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). In human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, it was confirmed that human PSMD12 (Rpn5), PSMD7 (Rpn8), PSMD13 (Rpn9), and PSMD14 (Rpn11) form a complex (Bai et al. 2019). PSMD14 (Rpn11) is not required for the formation of a heterotrimer between PSMD12 (Rpn5), PSMD7 (Rpn8) and PSMD13 (Rpn9) (Bai et al. 2019).
