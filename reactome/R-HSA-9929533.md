display_name: CCNA:CDK1 complex translocates to the cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Endogenous CCNA2 is exclusively nuclear in S phase but shows both nuclear
  and cytosolic localization from early G2 (Gheghiani et al. 2017, Silva Cascales
  et al. 2021). WEE1 activity does not affect the intracellular distribution of CCNA2
  (Gheghiani et al. 2017, Silva Cascales et al. 2021). Inhibition of CDK1 and CDK2
  catalytic activity does not compromise cytoplasmic accumulation of CCNA2 once initiated
  (Silva Cascales et al. 2021). CDK1 appears to facilitate the translocation of CCNA2
  to the cytosol, while CDK2 has no effect, although both CDK1 and CDK2 co-immunoprecipitate
  with cytosolic CCNA2 (Silva Cascales et al. 2021). Cytosolic CCNA2 promotes PLK1
  activation (Silva Cascales et al. 2021).
