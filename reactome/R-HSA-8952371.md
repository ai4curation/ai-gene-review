stable_id: R-HSA-8952371
display_name: MDM2 binds RUNX3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MDM2 and RUNX3 form a complex in the nucleus. Association of RUNX3 with CBFB
  does not interfere with binding of MDM2 to RUNX3. The interaction involves the acidic
  domain of MDM2 and the Runt domain of RUNX3 (Chi et al. 2009).
