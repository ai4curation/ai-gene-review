  activates the protease complex Calpain2, which cleaves Vinculin (VCL), a component
  of the peripheral cytoskeleton located between integrins and actin fibers (Miyazaki

  recruit the phosphodiesterase PDE4D5 and the phosphatase PP2A, which activates PDE4D5
  by dephosphorylating serine-715 and activates YAP1 by dephosphorylating serine-127
  (inferred from mouse homologs in Yun et al. 2016). Activated PDE4D5 hydrolyzes cAMP

  to the nucleus to activate pro-inflammatory genes such as NLRP3 (Lv et al. 2024).
