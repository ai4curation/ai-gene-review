summary: Viral nucleic acids are sensed by cellular pattern-recognition receptors
  (PRRs), such as RIG-I-like receptors (RLR). RLRs activate the adaptor protein called
  mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). MAVS recruits TBK1 (tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family member-associated NF-κB activator
  (TANK)-binding kinase 1) and/or its close homolog inhibitor-kappa-B kinase (IKK)
  epsilon (IKKε or IKBKE) via TRAFs (Fitzgerald KA et al. 2003; Fang R et al. 2017).
  The enzymatic activity of TBK1/IKBKE is initiated by phosphorylation at Ser172 located

  of kinase activity (Shimada T et al. 1999; Kishore N et al. 2002; Ma X et al. 2012;

  and structural studies suggest that dimerization of TBK1 precludes autophosphorylation
  and activation in cis (Larabi A et al. 2013). IKBKE is also a dimer (Nakatsu Y et
  al. 2014). Other kinases such as IKKs were also implicated in TBK1/IKBKE activation
  (Fang R et al. 2017). Further, K63-linked polyubiquitination on Lys30 and Lys401

## Summary

Viral nucleic acids are sensed by cellular pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as RIG-I-like receptors (RLR). RLRs activate the adaptor protein called mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). MAVS recruits TBK1 (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1) and/or its close homolog inhibitor-kappa-B kinase (IKK) epsilon (IKKε or IKBKE) via TRAFs (Fitzgerald KA et al. 2003; Fang R et al. 2017).
