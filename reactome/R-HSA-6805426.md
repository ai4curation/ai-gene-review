species: Homo sapiens
summary: Caspase activating and recruitment domain 8 protein (CARD8, also known as
  TUCAN, CARDINAL) has been implicated as a regulator of several pro-inflammatory
  and apoptotic signaling pathways. The C-terminal CARD domain of CARD8 (TUCAN) binds
  procaspase-9 (CASP9(1-416)) and interferes with binding of APAF1 to procaspase-9
  thus suppressing caspase activation induced by the APAF1:cytochrome c (CYCS) axis
  (Pathan N et al. 2001). The structural studies of CARD8 suggest that in addition
  to intermolecular CARD-CARD interactions, CARD domain may intramolecularly associate
  with the N-terminal function to find domain (FIIND) to regulate apoptotic and inflammatory
  signaling pathways (Jin T et al. 2013).<p>Several binding partners of CARD8 have
  been reported. CARD8 can interact physically via CARD domain  with caspase-1 and
  negatively regulates caspase-1-dependent IL-1beta generation in the THP-1 monocytic
  cell line (Razmara M et al. 2002). The FIIND domain of CARD8 may inhibit NFkappaB
  activation, possibly through interaction with IKKgamma (Bouchier-Hayes L et al.
  2001). FIIND may also bind the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) domain of NOD2 and
  NLRP3 to regulate the immune response to bacterial infections (Kampen O et al. 2010).<p>
  High levels of CARD8 expression have been observed in several tumor cell lines and
  malignant specimens from human patients underlying its importance in regulating
  inflammatory and apoptotic pathways (Bouchier-Hayes L et al.  2001; Pathan N et
  al. 2001; Razmara M et al. 2002; Zhang H & Fu W 2002; Yamamoto M et al. 2005).
