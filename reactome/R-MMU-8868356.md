display_name: Cdk5:p25 phosphorylates lamin A
species: Mus musculus
summary: In a mouse Alzheimer's disease model, nuclear fragmentation, which precedes
  neuronal death, is initiated by phosphorylation of nuclear lamins by p25-activated
  Cdk5. The Cdk5:p25 complex phosphorylates lamin A (Lmna-1) at serine residues S22
  and S392, with S392 being the major Cdk5 target site (Chang et al. 2011).
