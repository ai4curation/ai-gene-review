summary: This Reactome event shows binding of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex
  (integrin αIIbβ3, GPIIb/IIIa, ITGA2B:ITGB3) to the fibrin multimer.<p>Inside-out
  signaling during platelet activation induces conformational changes in the integrin
  αIIbβ3 (ITGA2B:ITGB3), facilitating its transition from a low-affinity to a high-affinity
  state. This transition is essential for the effective binding of αIIbβ3 to ligands
  such as fibrinogen and fibrin (Dai A et al., 2015; reviewed in Janus-Bell E & Mangin
  PH 2023). Integrin αIIbβ3 interacts with ligands-containing Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) or
  Ala--Gly-Asp (AGD) motifs in the presence of divalent metal ions (Springer TA et
  al., 2008; Coller BS 2015; Litvinov RI et al., 2016; Kononova O et al., 2017). The
  activation of αIIbβ3 not only promotes platelet aggregation but also influences
  the stability and architecture of the forming clot (Zhang Y et al., 2018; reviewed
  by Janus-Bell E & Mangin PH 2023). Upon clot formation, thrombin cleaves fibrinogen
  molecules, producing fibrin monomers, which then polymerize and form protofibrils.
  Fibrin in its polymeric form exhibits stronger and more stable interactions with
  αIIbβ3 than fibrinogen or fibrin monomers, with the stability order being fibrin
  polymer > fibrin monomer > fibrinogen (Litvinov RI et al., 2016; Höök P et al.,
  2017). Fibrinogen, a soluble plasma protein, binds to αIIbβ3 on the surface of activated
  platelets, contributing to platelet aggregation, while the stronger interaction
  of fibrin with αIIbβ3 stabilizes the thrombus (Savage B et al., 1992; Zafar H et
  al., 2017; Litvinov RI et al., 2016; Höök P et al., 2017). The interaction between
  fibrin and αIIbβ3 occurs through multiple binding sites within the β-propeller domain
  of αIIbβ3, distinct from those used by fibrinogen (Podolnikova NP et al., 2014).
  In addition, fibrin (and fibrinogen) and activated αIIbβ3 (ITGA2B:ITGB3) promote
  association of phosphatidylserine (PS)-bearing activated platelets with factor XIII
  (FXIII), a transglutaminase, which stabilizes the clot by cross-linking fibrin fibers
  (Mattheij NJA 2016; Kotova YN et al., 2019).
