stable_id: R-DME-432426
display_name: CRY is activated by light and binds to cytosolic TIM
species: Drosophila melanogaster
summary: At dawn, a light-induced conformational change in the blue-light photoreceptor
  cryptochrome (CRY) promotes the formation of a complex with Timeless (TIM).  In
  this model for the Circadian Clock pathway we are assuming that the cytoplasmic
  and nuclear mechanisms for TIM degradation are the same.  Also, in flies kept in
  constant darkness for many days, TIM levels still undergo daily oscillations, although
  not as robust as in light-dark cycles.  The mechanism that drives daily cycles in
  TIM levels during extended periods in complete darkness is not clear.
