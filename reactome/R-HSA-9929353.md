display_name: Deubiquitination of CD274
species: Homo sapiens
summary: COP9 signalosome 5 (CSN5) poses deubiquitination activity and is known to
  regulate the SCF (Skp1- cullinF-box)-containing complexes. In the study by Lim et
  al., 2016, CSN5 induced by TNF-alpha signalling was shown to augment PD-L1 (CD274)
  stability by deubiquitinating PD-L1.
