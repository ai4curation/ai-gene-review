display_name: Hspa8 transports unfolded substrate to lysosomal lumen for degradation
species: Rattus norvegicus
summary: Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) translocates substrates from the
  cytosol to the lysosomal membrane. Subsequently, the substrate unfolds and binds
  to Hspa8 in the lysosomal lumen. Hspa8 facilitates the transport of the unfolded
  substrate to the lumen where it is then degraded (Agarraberes FA et al. 1997, Cuervo
  AM et al. 1997).
