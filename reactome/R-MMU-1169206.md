stable_id: R-MMU-1169206
display_name: Jak2 phosphorylates Stat1/Stat3
species: Mus musculus
summary: GH stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of Stats 1, 3, and 5 in CHO cells expressing
  GHR constructs that bind JAK2 but not in CHO cells expressing GHR constructs that
  do not bind JAK2 (Smit et al. 1996). STAT5 phosphorylation was greatly reduced in
  GHR mutants with the distal region of the cytoplasmic tail removed and by mutation
  of distal GHR tyrosine residues to phenylalanine but this had no effect on STAT1/STAT3
  phosphorylation, suggesting that the latter interact with JAK2 directly.
