stable_id: R-HSA-5690702
display_name: LYN phosphorylates CD22
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After ligation of membrane-bound IgM, CD22 is quickly tyrosine phosphorylated
  on its cytoplasmic ITIM sequence (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif).
  The tyrosine kinase involved in CD22 phosphorylation is LYN, a member of the Src
  kinase family (Smith et al. 1998). The CD22 cytoplasmic tail contains six tyrosines,
  three of which belong to the ITIM sequence (Nitschke & Tsubata 2004).
