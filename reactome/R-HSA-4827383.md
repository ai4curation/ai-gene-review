display_name: WHSC1 (KMT3G), NSD1 (KMT3B), SMYD2 (KMT3C) methylate lysine-37 of histone
  H3 (H3K36)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Methylation of histone H3 lysine-37 (H3K36) is tightly associated with actively
  transcribed genes and appears to correspond primarily with coding regions (Wagner
  & Carpenter 2011).<br><br>WHSC1 (KMT3G, NSD2, MMSET), a member of the SET2 family,
  dimethylates H3K36 when provided with nucleosome substrates (Li et al 2009; Qiao
  et al. 2011). Dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine-37 (H3K36me2) is thought to
  be the principal chromatin-regulatory activity of WHSC1 (Kuo et al. 2011), SMYD2
  (KMT3C) (Brown et al 2006) and NSD1 (KMT3B) (Li et al. 2009, Qiao et al. 2011).
