summary: 'Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase
  TYK2 (TYK2) are believed to be phosphorylated after Interleukin-26 (IL26) ligand/receptor
  interaction. The Interleukin-10 receptor subunit beta (IL10RB)  component of the
  IL26 receptor is also a component of the IL10 receptor, where it associates with
  TYK2 (Finbloom & Winestock 1995). The Interleukin-20 receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA)
  component of the IL26 receptor, like the Interleukin-10 receptor subunit alpha (IL10RA)
  subunit of the IL10 receptor, is a type II cytokine receptor, suggested by homology
  with IL10RA to be capable of binding JAK1 (Ferrao et al. 2016). Structural models
  of the IL10 receptor suggest that the space between the two receptor subunits is
  occupied by JAK1 and TYK2 (Yoon et al. 2006, 2010). Taken together, these observations
  suggest that IL26 receptor signaling involves JAK1 and TYK2 activation.  '
