display_name: Activation of Calcineurin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Calcineurin (CaN), also called protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B), is a calcium/Calmodulin
  (CaM)-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase. It exists as a heterodimer
  consisting of CaM-binding catalytic subunit CaN A chain and a Ca+2 binding regulatory
  CaN B chain. At low calcium concentrations, CaN exists in an inactive state, where
  the autoinhibitory domain (AID) binds to the active-site cleft. Upon an increase
  in calcium concentration CaM binds to Ca+2 ions and gets activated. Active CaM binds
  to CaN regulatory domain (RD) and this causes release of the AID and activation
  of the phosphatase (Rumi-Masante et al. 2012). Binding of calcium to CaN B regulatory
  chain also causes a conformational change of the RD of CaN A chain (Yang & Klee
  2000).
