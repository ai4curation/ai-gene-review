species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once polyubiquitinated, the precursor p100 undergoes 26S proteasome mediated
  processing to form the mature p52 NF-kB subuunit. Different from complete degradation
  of other IkB proteins, the proteasome-mediated degradation of p100 only leads to
  loss of their C-terminal ankyrin repeat regions, leaving intact N-termini, p52 respectively
  (Amir et al. 2004).
