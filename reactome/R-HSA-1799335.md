display_name: Synthesis of nascent polypeptide containing signal sequence
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The synthesis of a protein destined for the endoplasmic reticulum starts
  with the canonical events of cytosolic translation initiation and proceeds to the
  point where a nascent polypeptide chain containing a signal sequence protrudes from
  the mRNA:ribosome complex. Merrick (2010) provides an overview of these events.

## Summary

The synthesis of a protein destined for the endoplasmic reticulum starts with the canonical events of cytosolic translation initiation and proceeds to the point where a nascent polypeptide chain containing a signal sequence protrudes from the mRNA:ribosome complex. Merrick (2010) provides an overview of these events.
