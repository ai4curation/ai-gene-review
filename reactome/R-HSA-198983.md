stable_id: R-HSA-198983
display_name: NKG2D homodimer interacting with ligands
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NKG2D is an activating immunoreceptor. By engaging NKG2D, HlA Class I-like
  molecules such as MICA, MICB, ULBP1-4 and RAE-1 provide powerful costimulation for
  NK cells and T-cells and can determine the magnitude and outcome of certain effector
  functions. NKG2D ligands are upregulated on the surfaces of cells under conditions
  of stress, for example infection or tumorigenesis, and therefore act as molecular
  flags to the immune system that something is wrong.
