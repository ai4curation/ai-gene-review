species: Homo sapiens
summary: G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) sense extracellular signals and activate
  different Guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). Upon activation, GPCRs
  can replace the GDP with GTP in the alpha subunit of G proteins. GTP binding modifies
  the conformation of G alpha proteins and activates them. The Regulator of G protein
  Signalling (RGS) are GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs) that can directly inhibit
  the G alpha subunit activity. There are at least 25 different types of RGS proteins
  known. Several of these RGS proteins (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21)
  can bind and stabilize the transition state of Guanine nucleotide binding protein
  G(q) subunit alpha class (GNAQ/GNA11/GNA14/GNA15). Following this, the RGS domain
  of the proteins exert GAP activity on G alpha (q) and allosterically modulate residues
  within G-alpha subunit to accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity that hydrolyses
  GTP to GDP. This inactivates G alpha (q) and terminates downstream signalling (Neubig
  & Siderovski 2002, Kach et al. 2012). The primary function of G alpha (q) is activation
  of phospholipase C beta thereby triggering phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium
  mobilization and protein kinase C activation.
