display_name: NLRP3 recruits PYCARD (ASC) via a PYD-PYD interaction
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NLRP3 interacts with ASC (Manji et al. 2003) via their PYD domains (Dowds
  et al. 2004). NLRP3 oligomerization leads to PYD domain clustering which is believed
  to facilitate the interaction of NLRP3 with the PYD domain of ASC (Schroder & Tschopp,
  2010).
