summary: The succinate dehydrogenase complex (SDH, complex II), associated with the
  inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the dehydrogenation of succinate to fumarate,
  reducing ubiquinone (Q10) to ubiquinol (Q10H2) on the membrane part of the enzyme.
  FAD is covalently bound to His-99 of the SDHA subunit (PDB 6VAX; Sharma et al.,
  2020). The redox potential of Q10H2 is then used in the electron transfer chain
  to drive a proton motive force to generate ATP (Devertanian et al., 1964; Renkema
  et al., 2015)<br><br>The endogenous metabolite itaconate has been shown to bind
  and inhibit Complex II, leading to an accumulation of succinate. Elevated succinate
  levels modulate immune, hypoxic and metabolic reprogramming pathways, including

  reviewed by Hayash et al., 2018; Peace & O'Neill, 2022). The mitochondrial heat
  shock protein 75 kDa (TRAP1) inhibits Complex II which elicits respiratory downregulation,
  leading to a pseudohypoxic state. This state is caused by succinate-dependent HIF1-alpha
