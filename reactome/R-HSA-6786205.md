display_name: KAMKMT transfers 3xCH3 groups from 3xAdoMet to CALM1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Calmodulin (CALM1) is a ubiquitous key mediator of Ca2+-dependent signalling
  and is subject to regulatory post-translational modifications which can affect protein-protein
  interactions. CALM1 is frequently trimethylated at Lys-116 which can influence changes
  in growth and development and  its activator properties with target enzymes. The
  cytosolic enzyme calmodulin-lysine N-methyltransferase (CAMKMT) catalyses the transfer
  of 3 methyl groups from high energy donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to lysine
  residue 116 in CALM1, forming a trimethylated protein (triMe-K116-CALM1) (Magnani
  et al. 2010).
