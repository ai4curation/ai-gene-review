stable_id: R-HSA-3000319
display_name: BORA binds PLK1 and AURKA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BORA is able to interact with both AURKA (Aurora A kinase) and PLK1. Binding
  of BORA to PLK1 increases the accessibility of PLK1 threonine residue T210 and also
  brings PLK1 in proximity to AURKA, enabling AURKA to phosphorylate T210 of PLK1
  and thereby activate PLK1 (Seki et al. 2008). While BORA is required for mitotic
  activation of AURKA in Drosophila (Hutterer et al. 2006), it does not significantly
  activate AURKA in human cells (Seki et al. 2008). AURKA is able to phosphorylate
  BORA in vitro, but the functional significance of this modification has not been
  determined (Hutterer et al. 2006).
