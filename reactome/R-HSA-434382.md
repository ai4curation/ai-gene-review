display_name: ACSL3,4 ligates coenzyme A (CoA-SH) to a long chain fatty acid yielding
  fatty acyl-coenzyme A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ACSL3 and ACSL4 found on the mitochondria of pancreatic beta cells ligate
  coenzyme A (Co-A) to fatty acids such as palmitate (Ansari et al. 2017) prior to
  transport into mitochondria by the carnitine system and beta oxidation in the mitochondrial
  matrix yielding ATP.
