display_name: Phosphorylation of ZAP-70 by Lck
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'In ZAP-70 there are multiple phosphorylation sites (Y292, Y315, Y319, Y492,
  Y493) which have both positive and negative regulatory effect on its catalytic activity.
  Tyrosine 493 is a conserved regulatory site found within the activation loop of
  the kinase domain. This site has shown to be a positive regulatory site required
  for ZAP-70 kinase activity and is phosphorylated by Lck. This phosphorylation contribute
  to the active conformation of the catalytic domain. '
