display_name: Elongation of eicosapentaenoyl-CoA to docosapentaenoyl-CoA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Eicosapentaenoyl-CoA (EPA-CoA) is transformed to docosapentaenoyl-CoA (DPA-CoA/clupanodonic
  acid; 7,10,13,16,19-22:5(n-3)) by addition of two carbon atoms from malanoyl-CoA.
  This reaction is catalyzed by the enzymes ELOVL5/2 (Leonard et al. 2004). DPA is
  quite high in seal oil and may act as an anti-atherogenic factor. DPA has 10-fold
  greater endothelial cell migration ability than EPA, which is important in wound-healing
  processes. DPA may act as a precursor for production of the DPA-related  D-series
  of resolvins or neuroprotectins (Kaur et al. 2011).
