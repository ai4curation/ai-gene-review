display_name: Resolution of Holliday junctions cleaved by GEN1 or SLX1A:SLX4:MUS81:EME1,(MUS81:EME2)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The identity of DNA ligases that ligate DNA strands generated during cleavage
  of Holliday junctions by GEN1 or the SLX-MUS complex (composed of SLX1A:SLX4 heterodimer
  and MUS81:EME1 or possibly MUS81:EME2 heterodimer) is not known. The resolvase activity
  of GEN1 or SLX-MUS predominantly results in the generation of crossover products,
  with exchange of genetic material between sister chromatids (Wyatt et al. 2013).
