stable_id: R-HSA-6803523
display_name: PTB and hnRNPA1 bind FGFR2 pre-mRNA to repress IIIb splicing and promote
  formation of FGFR2c mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Repression of FGFR2 exon IIIb splicing in mesenchymal cells depends on intronic
  splicing silencer (ISS) sequences upstream of exon IIIb as well as an exonic splicing
  element (ESE) within exon IIIb.  These elements are bound by PTB1 and hnRNPA1, respectively,
  as part of a larger splicing complex, promoting the formation and expression of
  mature FGFR2c mRNA in mesenchymal cells (Carstens et al, 2000; Gil et al, 1991;  Del
  Gatto et al, 1997; Del Gatto et al, 1999).  For more detailed information on splicing
  and pre-mRNA maturation, please see the mRNA splicing pathway.
