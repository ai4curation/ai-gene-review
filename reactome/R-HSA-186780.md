stable_id: R-HSA-186780
display_name: PI3-kinase binds to the active receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of enzymes which can
  phosphorylate phosphoinositides. PI3Ks bind to and are activated by PDGF receptors.
  Tyr 740 and Tyr 751 in PDGF beta-receptor, and Tyr 731 and Tyr 742 in PDGF alpha-receptor
  have been shown to be autophosphorylation sites and to bind PI3-kinase.  <br>
