display_name: VLDLR:PCSK9 binds Clathrin-coated vesicles
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to very
  low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), the resultant complex is internalised
  via the canonical clathrin-dependent endocytic machinery. This degradation route
  that does not require ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor and
  does not involve proteasomal or autophagy pahtways (Zhang et al. 2007, Poirier et
  al. 2008).

## Summary

This degradation route that does not require ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor and does not involve proteasomal or autophagy pahtways (Zhang et al. 2007, Poirier et al. 2008).
