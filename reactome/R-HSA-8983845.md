display_name: p-STAT1 dissociates from IL6ST:IL6ST
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-35 (IL35) can signal via IL35 receptors triggering the JAK/STAT
  pathway downstream. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta
  (STAT1) binds to the JAK associated-IL35 receptor complex and is activated via phosphorylations.
  Subsequently, phosphorylated p-STAT1 dissociates from the receptor complex (Collison
  et al. 2012). This is a black box event because there is no literature evidence
  about the exact mechanism of the release of STAT1 from the receptor complex.
