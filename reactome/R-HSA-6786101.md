stable_id: R-HSA-6786101
display_name: IL4 binds IL4R:JAK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The first step in the formation of both types of IL4 receptor is the binding
  of Interleukin-4 (IL4) with Interleukin-4 receptor subunit alpha (IL4R) , which
  has Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) constitutively associated (Hoffman et al. 1995, Shen et
  al. 1996, Hage et al. 1999).
