stable_id: R-HSA-9860160
display_name: MIR-Let7-a1 microRNA binds 3'UTR of TGFBR3 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Studies by Wang et al.,2019  suggest that TGFBR3 is a target gene of microRNA
  let‐7a. microRNA let‐7a has also been shown to regulate cardiomyocyte apoptosis
  by down-regulating TGFBR3 expression (Chen et al, 2019.)
