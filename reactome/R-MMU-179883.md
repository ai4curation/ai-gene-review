stable_id: R-MMU-179883
display_name: Mouse pro-EGF is cleaved by ADAM sheddases
species: Mus musculus
summary: Ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  are shed from the
  plasma membrane by metalloproteases.  Identification of the sheddases for EGFR ligands
  using mouse embryonic cells lacking candidate sheddases (a disintegrin and metalloprotease;
  ADAM) has revealed that ADAM10, -12 and -17 are the sheddases of the EGFR ligands
  in response to various shedding stimulants such as GPCR agonists, growth factors,
  cytokines, osmotic stress, wounding and phorbol ester. Among the EGFR ligands, heparin-binding
  EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), EGF and TGF-alpha are the best characterized.
