display_name: PINK1 phosphorylates Ub on MOM proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon mitochondrial damage, activated PINK1 accumulates at the mitochondrial
  outer membrane (MOM), where it phosphorylates the S65 residue in ubiquitin (Ub)
  moieties conjugated to MOM proteins (Kane LA et al., 2014; Koyano F et al., 2014;
  Ordureau A et al., 2015, 2018; Zittlau KI et al., 2022). This leads to increased
  recruitment of E3 ubiquitin protein ligase parkin (PRKN) to damaged mitochondria
  (Koyano F et al., 2014; ShibaFukushima K et al., 2014; Ordureau A et al., 2015).
  Activated PINK1 then phosphorylates PRKN at S65 in the N-terminal Ub-like domain
  inducing the E3 ligase activity of PRKN (Kazlauskaite A et al., 2015; Ordureau A
  et al., 2015). Activated PRKN, in turn, ubiquitinates MOM proteins generating more
  Ub moieties for PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ub thus leading to a feedforward
  loop in the PINK1:PRKN pathway (Ordureau A et al., 2014, 2015; Sauve V et al., 2022).
  The coordinated activities of PINK1 and PRKN ensure effective removal of dysfunctional
  mitochondrial components through mitophagy and promotes overall mitochondrial quality
  control. <p>This Reactome event describes PINK-mediated phosphorylation of Ub on
  the selected MOM proteins such as MFN1, MFN2, TOMM20, VDACs.

## Summary
