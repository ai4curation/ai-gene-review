stable_id: R-HSA-5683792
display_name: p-T68-CHEK2 autophosphorylates
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon dimerization, p-T68-CHEK2 protomers trans-autophosphorylate on serine
  residue S379 (Lovly et al. 2008) and threonine residues T383 and T387 (Lee et al.
  2001). Autophosphorylation leads to dissociation of CHEK2 dimers into active CHEK2
  monomers (Cai et al. 2009).
