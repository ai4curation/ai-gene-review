display_name: Formation of 4Fe-4S cluster on ISCA1:ISCA2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Iron-sulfur clusters containing 4Fe-4S are assembled from 2Fe-2S clusters
  on ISCA1:ISCA2 heterodimers (Banci et al. 2014, Brancaccio et al. 2014, inferred
  from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in Mühlenhoff et al. 2011). GLRX5:2Fe-2S can donate
  2Fe-2S clusters to ISCA1:ISCA2 in vitro (Banci et al. 2014, Brancaccio et al. 2014).
  It is unclear if other proteins also donate 2Fe-2S clusters. Two conserved C-terminal
  cysteines of ISCA1:ISCA2 heterodimers extract [2Fe-2S] clusters from GLRX5, forming
  a ISCA1:ISCA2:GLRX5 intermediate containing two 2Fe-2S clusters (Brancaccio et al.
  2017). The physiological electron donor required to convert the two 2Fe-2S clusters
  bound to the intermediate into a 4Fe-4S cluster is not yet characterized. ISCA1,
  ISCA2, and IBA57 are required for formation of holoenzymes such as aconitase that
  contain 4Fe-4S clusters (Sheftel et al. 2012). HSCB (HSC20), the homolog of yeast
  JAC1, interacts with HSPA9 and appears to facilitate the reaction (Uhrigshardt et
  al. 2010).
