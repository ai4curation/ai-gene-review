## Summary

High-resolution structures of free, catalytically active yeast Pol II and of an elongating form reveal that Pol II elongation complex includes features like: <BR> - RNA-DNA hybrid, an unwound template ahead of 3'-OH terminus of growing transcript and an exit groove at the base of the CTD, possibly for dynamic interaction of processing and transcriptional factors.<BR>- a cleft or channel created by Rpb1 and Rpb2 subunits to accommodate DNA template, extending to Mg2+ ion located deep in the enzyme core <BR> -a 50 kDa "clamp" with open confirmation in free polymerase, allowing entry of DNA strands but closed in the processive elongation phase. <BR> The clamp is composed of portions of Rpb1,Rpb2 and Rpb3 , five loops or "switches" that change from unfolded to well-folded structures stabilizing the elongation complex,  and a long "bridging helix" that emanates from Rpb1 subunit, crossing near the Mg2+ ion.
