display_name: PKA phosphorylates NOS3 (eNOS) on serine-633
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Protein kinase A (PKA) is activated by Adrenomedullin signaling in response
  to laminar flow shear stress and phosphorylates NOS3 (eNOS) on serine-633 (Iring
  et al. 2019, also inferred from bovine homologs in Boo et al. 2002). Gs (ADM signaling)
  and Gq/11 (ATP signaling) activate NOS3 activity additively (Iring et al. 2019),
  resulting in release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells that causes vasodilation.
