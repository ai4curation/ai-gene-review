display_name: Ion channel transport
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Ion channels mediate the flow of ions across the plasma membrane of cells.
  They are integral membrane proteins, typically a multimer of proteins, which, when
  arranged in the membrane, create a pore for the flow of ions. There are different
  types of ion channels. P-type ATPases undergo conformational changes to translocate
  ions. Ligand-gated ion channels operate like a gate, opened or closed by a chemical
  signal. Voltage-gated ion channels are activated by changes in electrical potential
  difference at the membrane (Purves, 2001; Kuhlbrandt, 2004).
