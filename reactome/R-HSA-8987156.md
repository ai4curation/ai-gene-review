species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A or 5B
  (STAT5) dissociates from the Interleukin-20 (IL20) receptor complex (Tristaris et
  al. 2007). This is a black box event because dissociation is inferred from the signalling
  events of other Interleukins where phosphorylated STATs translocate to the nucleus,
  as with Interleukin-3 (Hirose et al. 2014).  '

## Summary

Phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A or 5B (STAT5) dissociates from the Interleukin-20 (IL20) receptor complex (Tristaris et al. 2007). This is a black box event because dissociation is inferred from the signalling events of other Interleukins where phosphorylated STATs translocate to the nucleus, as with Interleukin-3 (Hirose et al. 2014).
