display_name: GADD45A binds PCNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GADD45A binds PCNA homotrimer (Smith et al. 1994, Hall et al. 1995, Sanchez
  et al. 2010). The consequences of this interaction are not clear. Binding to GADD45A
  may negatively regulate PCNA-mediated DNA synthesis during S phase of the cell cycle
  or it may promote PCNA-mediated DNA repair synthesis (Smith et al. 1994, Kim et
  al. 2013).
