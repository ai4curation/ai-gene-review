display_name: PITRM1 proteolyzes mitochondrial targeting peptides (presequences)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After MPP cleaves off targeting peptides (also called presequences) of proteins
  imported into the mitochondrial matrix, PITRM1 (also called PreP) proteolyzes the
  cleaved targeting peptides (Pinho et al. 2010, Alikhani et al. 2011, Teixeira et
  al. 2012). PITRM1 also cleaves amyloid beta peptide that is imported into the matrix
  (Falkevall et al. 2006).  Missense mutations in PITRM1 are associated with a neurological
  syndrome comprising mental retardation, spinocerebellar ataxia, cognitive decline,
  psychosis and possible epilepsy (Brunetti et al. 2016).
