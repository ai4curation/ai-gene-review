stable_id: R-HSA-166869
display_name: TRAF6 binds MEKK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRAF6 binding to MAPK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) is mediated by the adapter
  protein evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathway or in short
  ECSIT (Kopp E et al 1999). Induced MEKK1 can activate both IKK alpha and IKK beta
  thus leading to induction of NF-kappa-B activation. MEKK1 was also shown to induce
  ERK1/2 and JNK activation [Yujiri T et al 1998].<p>Although TRAF6 interacts with
  several upstream mediators (IRAK1, IRAK2, TRIF), there is no data showing MEKK1
  participating in the interaction with the TRAF6 activators. Therefore this reaction
  is simplified to include only TRAF6 and MEKK1.
