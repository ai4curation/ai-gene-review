display_name: RCHY1 binds alanine-tailed nascent peptide and Ub:UBE2D2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RCHY1 (also called PIRH2) binds C-terminal alanine residues that have been
  polymerized ("CAT-tailed") by NEMF onto a nascent peptide from a 60S ribosomal subunit
  that has been dissociated from a stalled 80S ribosome (Thrun et al. 2021, Patil
  et al. 2023, Wang et al. 2023). The mechanism by which the alanine-tailed nascent
  peptide is cleaved from the peptidyl tRNA and extracted from the 60S subunit is
  not characterized. The N-terminal region and the RING domain of RCHY1 form a groove
  that associates with the poly-alanine tail (Wang et al. 2023).
