display_name: Nucleolar Chromatin Remodeling Complex (NoRC) binds intergenic spacer
  of rRNA gene
species: Mus musculus
summary: The Nucleolar Remodeling Complex (NoRC) comprises Tip5 (Baz2a) and the chromatin
  remodeller SNF2h (Smarca5) (Strohner et al. 2001). Promoter-associated RNA (pRNA)
  transcribed from the intergenic spacer region is bound by Tip5 and is required to
  direct the complex to the main promoter of the rRNA gene, possibly by triple helix
  formation by pRNA and the rDNA (Mayer et al. 2006, Santoro et al. 2010). The PHD
  domain of Tip5 binds histone H4 acetylated at lysine-16 (Zhou and Grummt 2005).
  Transcription Termination Factor-I (Ttf-I) binds to a promoter-proximal terminator
  (T0 site) in the rDNA and interacts with the Tip5 subunit of NoRC (Nemeth et al.
  2004, Strohner et al. 2004, Santoro and Grummt 2005). NoRC also interacts with the
  SIN3-HDAC complex, Hdac1, Hdac2, Dnmt1, and Dnmt3b (Santoro et al. 2002, Zhou and
  Grummt 2005, Santoro and Grummt 2005). Dnmt3b binds to the triple helix formed by
  pRNA and the rDNA (Schmitz et al. 2010). Hdac1, Dnmt1, and Dnmt3b have been shown
  to be required for proper DNA methylation of silenced rRNA gene copies. Binding
  of pRNA to the rDNA causes displacement of TTF-I (Schmitz et al. 2010).

## Summary

The Nucleolar Remodeling Complex (NoRC) comprises Tip5 (Baz2a) and the chromatin remodeller SNF2h (Smarca5) (Strohner et al. 2001).
