display_name: Activated type I receptor phosphorylates SMAD2/3 directly
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated type I receptor kinase directly phosphorylates two of the C-terminal
  serine residues of SMAD1, SMAD5 or SMAD8. Binding of these R-SMADs to the L45 loop
  of the type I receptor is critical for this event.
