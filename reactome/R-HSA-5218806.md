species: Homo sapiens
summary: FYN recruited to VEGFR2 is activated; this is required for VEGF-induced actin
  remodelling and endothelial migration. Once Y531 in the negative regulatory site
  is dephosphorylated by a phosphatase, FYN undergoes autophosphorylation on Y420
  (Yeo et al. 2011).

## Summary

FYN recruited to VEGFR2 is activated; this is required for VEGF-induced actin remodelling and endothelial migration. Once Y531 in the negative regulatory site is dephosphorylated by a phosphatase, FYN undergoes autophosphorylation on Y420 (Yeo et al. 2011).
