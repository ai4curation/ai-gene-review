display_name: NPM1-ALK fusion dimer binds SKP1:CUL1:RBX1:ZC3HC1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ZC3HC1, also known as NIPA (nuclear interacting partner of anaplastic lymphoma
  kinase), was identified as a protein partner of NPM-ALK fusion in two hybrid and
  co-imuunoprecipitation studies (Ouyang et al, 2003). ZC3HC1 is an F-box component
  of an SCF complex that targets nuclear CDKN1B (cyclin B1) for ubiquitination and
  degradation in interphase, regulating mitotic entry (Ouyang et al, 2003; Basserman
  et al, 2005; Illert et al, 2012). Binding to NPM-ALK depends on ALK kinase activity
  and is mediated through ZC3HC1 residues 306-402 (Ouyang et al, 2003). ZC3HC1 is
  predominantly a nuclear protein whose localization is governed by a nuclear localization
  signal (NLS). Although NPM is a nucleo-cytoplasmic protein, the fusion with ALK
  does not contain the endogenous NPM NLS, and the fusion is predominantly cytoplasmic.
  Nuclear localization of the fusion may be mediated by oligomerization with full-length
  NPM. <br>ZC3HC1 is phosphorylated downstream of NPM-ALK in a manner that depends
  on ERK2 (Ouyang et al, 2003; Basserman et al, 2005; Illert et al, 2012; Gegenbacher
  et al, 2019) Phosphorylation inactivates the SCF complex, allowing CDKN1B to accumulate
  and drive mitotic entry (Ouyang et al, 2003; Basserman et al, 2005; Illert et al,
  2012).
