stable_id: R-HSA-5691150
display_name: TFR2 dimer binds 2xholoTF
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) is highly expressed in liver and erythroid
  precursor cells and is a close homologue of human transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC).
  Transferrin (TF), loaded with iron (holoTF), transports two ferric iron ions through
  the blood. Two holoTFs bind to a TFR2 dimer (with lower affinity than to TFRC) and
  mediates cellular uptake of holoTF in a non-iron dependent manner (Kawabata et al.
  1999, Trinder & Baker 2003). Defects in TFR2 can cause hemochromatosis 3 (HFE3;
  MIM:604250), an iron metabolism disorder characterised by iron overload. Excess
  iron is deposited over decades in a variety of organs leading to their failure,
  resulting in serious illnesses including cirrhosis, hepatomas, diabetes, cardiomyopathy,
  arthritis and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Camaschella et al. 2000, Wallace &
  Subramaniam 2007).
