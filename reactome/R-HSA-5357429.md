species: Homo sapiens
summary: VEGFA-dependent activation of VEGFR2 causes autophosphorylation and activation
  of the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase via Src-1:SH2D2A-dependent reaction. Phosphorylation
  of Axl tyrosine residues 779 and 821 (773 and 815 in mouse) is required for VEGFA-dependent
  binding of the p85-subunit of PI3K and activation of PI3K (Ruan & Kazlauskas, 2012).
