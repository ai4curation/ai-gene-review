display_name: PolyUb:misfolded proteins dissociate from PRKN:UBE2N:UBE2V1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Misfolded proteins from cellular stress are destined for degradation via
  ubiquitination. The E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes UBE2N/UBE2V1 and E3 ligase
  enzyme Parkin recruit and tag multiple K63-linked ubiquitin molecules to the misfolded
  proteins. Subsequently, the polyubiquitinated proteins dissociate from the E2/E3
  system and are driven to degradation (Olzmann JA et al. 2007).
