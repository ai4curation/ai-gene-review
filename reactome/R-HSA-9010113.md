display_name: ADAM10:Zn2+ binds TSPANs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ADAM (A disintegrin and metalloprotease domain) family are membrane-anchored
  metalloproteases that mediate the proteolytic cleavage of many transmembrane proteins
  within their extracellular regions. This so-called ectodomain shedding plays an
  important role in many cell and developmental processes. ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and
  Metalloproteinase 10) has been identified as the major physiological alpha-secretase
  in neurons (Lammich et al. 1999, Kuhn et al. 2010), responsible for cleaving amyloid
  precursor protein (APP) in a non-amyloidogenic manner and producing APPs-alpha,
  a neuroprotective APP-derived peptide.<p>The trafficking of ADAM10 is regulated
  by a subgroup of the tetraspanin superfamily which have eight cysteines in the largest
  of the two extracellular domains and are referred to as TspanC8 tetraspanins. Tetraspanins
  associate specifically and directly with a limited number of proteins, and also
  with other tetraspanins, thereby generating a "tetraspanin web". Through these interactions,
  tetraspanins are believed to have a role in cell and membrane compartmentalisation
  (Charrin et al. 2014). TSPAN4, 14, 15 and 33 are thought to mediate ADAM10 exit
  from the ER and transport to the plasma membrane in a variety of ways (Noy et al.
  2016, Jouannet et al. 2016).
