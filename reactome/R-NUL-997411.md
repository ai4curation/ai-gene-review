display_name: AGER binds rat ERK1/2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region of the advanced glycation end-products
  receptor (AGER) is responsible for binding to extracellular signal-regulated protein
  kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2 or MAPK3/1). This region is similar to the D-domain, an
  ERK docking site which is conserved in some ERK substrates (Ishihara et al. 2003).

## Summary

A membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region of the advanced glycation end-products receptor (AGER) is responsible for binding to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2 or MAPK3/1). This region is similar to the D-domain, an ERK docking site which is conserved in some ERK substrates (Ishihara et al. 2003).
