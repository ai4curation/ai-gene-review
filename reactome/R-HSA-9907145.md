stable_id: R-HSA-9907145
display_name: IRF4 binds the TYR promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IRF4 binds to elements in the promoter of the TYR gene to promote its expression,
  as assesed by reporter gene and ChIP in melanocytes and melanoma cell lines (Praetorious
  et al, 2013). Consistent with this, knockdown of IRF4 decreases TYR expression in
  501mel cells. IRF4-dependent TYR expression depends on cooperation with MITF-M,
  as demonstrated by co-transfection assays in HEK293 cells (Praetorius et al, 2013).
