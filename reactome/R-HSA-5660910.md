display_name: Defective SLC7A7 does not exchange L-Arg for L-Leu, Na+ across the plasma
  membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SLC7A7 encodes the y+L amino acid transporter 1 (y+LAT1). As a heterodimer
  with SLC3A2 in the plasma membrane, SLC7A7 mediates the exchange of arginine (L-Arg)
  for leucine (L-Leu) and a sodium ion (Na+). The physiological concentrations of
  arginine and leucine are expected to favor arginine export. Defects in SLC7A7 can
  cause Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI; MIM:222700), a metabolic disorder characterised
  by decreased cationic amino acid (CAA) transport at the basolateral membrane of
  epithelial cells in the intestine and kidney, increased renal excretion of CAA and
  orotic aciduria. Mutations in SLC7A7 that can cause LPI include M50K, T188I, L334R,
  W242*, Y457* and T299Ifs*10 (Sperandeo et al. 2005, Torrents et al. 1999, Sperandeo
  et al. 2000, Borgani et al. 1999).
