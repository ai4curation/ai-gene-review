display_name: Phosphorylated heterodimers of ERBB2 ECD mutants and EGFR bind GRB2:GAB1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ERBB2 G309E and ERBB2 S310F activate PI3K/AKT signaling, demonstrated by
  activating phosphorylation of AKT1 (Greulich et al. 2012). Activation of PI3K/AKT
  signaling downstream of ERBB2 G309A has not been tested. It is assumed that phosphorylated
  heterodimers of ERBB2 ECD mutants and EGFR, like the wild type heterodimers of ERBB2
  and EGFR, can bind to the GRB2:GAB1 complex.
