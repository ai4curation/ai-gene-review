summary: Splicing of pre-mRNAs occurs co-transcriptionally in mammals. The U1 snRNP,
  comprising the U1 snRNA, Sm ring, SNRNP70, SNRPA, and SNRPC, interacts with RNA
  polymerase II (Zhang et al. 2021) and binds the 5' splice site of the nascent pre-mRNA
  to initiate formation of the early spliceosomal complex (Spliceosomal E complex)
  (Zhuang and Weiner 1986, Kondo et al. 2015, Tan et al. 2016). Binding of the U1
  snRNA to the pre-mRNA is mediated by base-pairing between the U1 snRNA and the 5'
  splice site. The zinc finger of SNRPC also binds the pre-RNA to stabilize the interaction
  (Kondo et al. 2015). Within the Spliceosomal E complex, SF1 binds the branch point
  within the intron and pre-bulges the adenosine residue of the branch point (Crisci
  et al. 2015). The U2AF1:U2AF2 heterodimer (also called the U2AF35:U2AF65 heterodimer
  or the U2AF complex) binds the polypyrimidine tract of the intron and the 3' splice
  site (Berglund et al. 1998). The U2 snRNP complex may be loosely associated with
  the Spliceosomal E complex but does not yet bind the pre-mRNA (Hong et al. 1997,
  Das et al. 2000). Most alternative splicing factors bind the pre-mRNA prior to formation
  of the Spliceosomal E complex and influence the selection of the splice sites by
  interacting with components of the spliceosome. The components of the Spliceosomal
  E complex have been ascertained using proteomic and structural methods (Hartmuth
  et al. 2002, Rappsilber et al. 2002, Hegele et al. 2012, Makarov et al. 2012).
