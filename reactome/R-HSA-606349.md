stable_id: R-HSA-606349
display_name: Mis18 complex binds the centromere
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Mis18 complex (containing Mis18-alpha, Mis18-beta, Mis18BP1, RBap46,
  and RbAp48) transiently binds the centromere in late anaphase-telophase to early
  G1. The mechanism by which the Mis18 complex binds the centromere is unknown. The
  Mis18 complex is required for deposition of new CENPA-containing nucleosomes at
  the centromere. The CENPH-I complex is constitutively associated with centromeres
  and is required for deposition of new CENPA-containing nucleosomes.
