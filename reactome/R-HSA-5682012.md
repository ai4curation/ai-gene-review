  et al. 2019). In intestinal epithelium, loss of Atg16l2 reverses the phenotype of
  a conditional Atg16l1 knockout, suggesting that the role of Atg16l2 in modulating
  Atg16l1 function is tissue-specific (Khor et al. 2019). In mouse bone marrow-derived
  macrophages, Atg16l2 is needed to promote autophagy under stress conditions but
  not under resting conditions, and Atg16l2 may act by promoting binding of Atg16l1
  to Atg5 through an unknown mechanism (Wang et al. 2022).</p>'
