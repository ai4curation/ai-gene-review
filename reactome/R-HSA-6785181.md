display_name: LMF1,2 bind LIPC dimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Hepatic triacylglycerol lipase (LIPC, and lipoprotein lipase, LPL) are dimeric
  lipases (Hill et al. 1997) that hydrolyse triglycerides from circulating lipoproteins
  thereby playing important roles in lipoprotein remodeling and uptake. LIPC dimer
  (as well as LPL dimer) binds to an ER membrane protein known as lipase maturation
  factor 1 (LMF1) which can mediate secretion and enzymatic maturation of these lipases
  (Babilonia-Rosa & Neher 2014). Another family member, LMF2, may function as LMF1
  based on similarity. Defects in LMF1 can cause combined lipase deficiency (CLD;
  MIM:246650), characterised by hypertriglyceridemia caused by ER retention of both
  LIPC and LPL (Peterfy et al. 2007).
