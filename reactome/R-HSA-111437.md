stable_id: R-HSA-111437
display_name: Cleavage of the 3'-end of the Histone Pre-mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Processing is initiated once the U7 snRNP is loaded onto the pre-mRNA. The
  pre-mRNA HDE makes base-pairing contacts with the 5”² end of U7 snRNA. Binding of
  the U7 snRNP to the pre-mRNA is stabilized by interactions between a U7 snRNP protein,
  hZFP100 and other trans-acting factors, including the factor that catalyzes the
  cleavage reaction, which have yet to be defined. The cleavage occurs in the presence
  of EDTA as does the cleavage reaction in polyadenylation, it is likely that this
  reaction is catalyzed by a protein. There may well be additional proteins associated
  with the U7 snRNP, since the in vitro processing occurs in the absence of SLBP,
  it is possible that all the other factors required for processing are associated
  with the active form of the U7 snRNP.
