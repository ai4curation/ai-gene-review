stable_id: R-HSA-8866941
display_name: MID1IP1 binds THRSP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mid1-interacting protein 1 (MID1IP1, aka MIG12, SPOT14R, S14R) plays a role
  in the regulation of lipogenesis in the liver. It is rapidly upregulated by processes
  that induce lipogenesis (enhanced glucose metabolism, thyroid hormone administration)
  (Tsatsos et al. 2008). MID1IP1 forms a heterodimer with thyroid hormone-inducible
  hepatic protein (THRSP, aka SPOT14, S14), proposed to play the same role in lipogenesis
  as MID1IP1 (Aipoalani et al. 2010). This complex can polymerize acetyl-CoA carboxylases
  1 and 2 (ACACA and B), the first committed enzymes in fatty acid (FA) synthesis.
  Polymerization enhances ACACA and ACACB enzyme activities (Kim et al. 2010, Park
  et al. 2013).
