display_name: NR3C1 binds NR3C1 agonists
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 (Rupprecht et
  al. 1993, Lind et al. 2000), inhibiting pro-inflammatory NF-Kappa B and other inflammatory
  transcription factors, and promoting anti-inflammatory genes like interleukin-10.
  The short term effects of corticosteroids are decreased vasodilation and permeability
  of capillaries, as well as decreased leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation.
  From the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial in June 2020,
  dexamethasone was recommended for use in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory
  symptoms. In the trial, dexamethasone reduced deaths by approximately one third
  in patients requiring ventilation and by one fifth in those requiring oxygen.
