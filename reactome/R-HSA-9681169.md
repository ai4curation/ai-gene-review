summary: Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), a new class of anti cancer drug derived from
  thalidomide, exert potent anti cancer effects. IMiDs bind to cereblon (CRBN), a
  substrate receptor of CRL4 E3 ligase, to induce the ubiquitination and degradation
  of IKZF1 and IKZF3 (encoding transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos) in multiple
  myeloma cells, contributing to their anti myeloma activity (Ito & Handa 2016, 2019,
  Asatsuma Okumura et al. 2019).<br><br>Thalidomide and anti inflammatory mediator
  therapy are being evaluated for clinical efficacy in patients with severe COVID-19.
  These combine the immunosuppressive action of thalidomide with the anti inflammatory
  actions of glucocorticoids and COX inhibition (clinical trials NCT04273529 and NCT04273581).<br><br>Additional
  thalidomide analogues have activities that suggest possible roles for them in COVID-19
  treatments although we have not annotated them here. Pomalidomide and lenalidomide

  bind to this target and inhibit ubiquitin ligase activity (Lopez Girona et al. 2012).
  IKZF1 and IKZF3 are susceptibility loci for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
  Iberdomide (CC 220), a CRBN modulator with higher binding affinity than other IMiDs,
  targets a greater degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos than other IMiDs (Matyskiela

  CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse large B cell lymphoma
  (DLBCL) (Hagner et al. 2015), advanced solid tumors, non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
  and multiple myeloma (Rasco et al. 2019).
