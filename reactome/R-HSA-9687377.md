display_name: Defective RB1 does not form a complex with SKP2 and FZR1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A tripartite complex formed between RB1, SKP2 and FZR1 (Cdh1) targets SKP2
  for the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C:Cdh1)-mediated ubiquitination
  and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Both SKP2 and FZR1 interact with
  the pocket domain of RB1, with amino acid residues 637–738 and 772–824 involved
  in SKP2 binding and the cleft region (amino acids 753–761), containing the LxCxE
  motif, involved in FZR1 binding (Binne et al. 2007). RB1 T738_R775del (RB1 Ex22del)
  cancer mutant, which lacks exon 22, is able to associate with SKP2 but unable to
  bind FZR1. This mutant is defective in inducing accumulation of CDKN1B (p27Kip1)
  and promoting mitotic exit as it cannot prevent SKP2-mediated ubiquitination and
  degradation of CDKN1B (Ji et al. 2004, Binne et al. 2007). RB1 T738_R775del mutant
  is also defective in E2F binding (Ji et al. 2004). RB1 missense mutant, RB1 R661W,
  which causes low penetrance familial retinoblastoma, is unable to bind to E2Fs but
  retains the ability to bind to SKP2 and FZR2 and to induce CDKN1B accumulation (Ji
  et al. 2004, Binne et al. 2007).
