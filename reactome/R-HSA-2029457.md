species: Homo sapiens
summary: FCGRIII (CD16) is a low affinity Fc gamma receptor and is encoded by two
  genes (A and B), the transmembrane form FCGRIIIA and the GPI anchored FCGRIIIB (Edberg
  et al. 1989). FCGRIIIA is involved in phagocytosis and is expressed in macrophages
  and natural killer cells as a multi chain complex consisting of a single alpha chain
  containing IgG binding domains and a signal transducing gamma and/or zeta dimer
  (Wirthmuller et al. 1992, Lanier et al. 1989, Garcia Garcia & Rosales 2002). Both
  gamma and zeta chains contain a conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation
  motif (ITAM), which has 2 copies of the YXXL sequence (Isakov 1997). However, the
  gamma chain of FCGRIIIA is approximately sixfold more efficient in mediating phagocytosis
  than the zeta subunit (Park & Schreiber 1995). Phosphorylation of the conserved
  tyrosine residues of the ITAM in these accessory proteins is required for the phagocytic
  signal mediated by FCRGIIIA. <br>The first step in Fc-gamma receptor (FCGR) phagocytosis
  is binding and clustering of FCGRs by IgG-coated foreign particles (For this particular
  pathway the coated foreing particle is the Leishmania parasite). FCGR are clustered
  at the cell surface by multivalent antigen-antibody complexes and recruited to lipid
  raft micro domains; monovalent ligand binding is insufficient to generate a signal.
