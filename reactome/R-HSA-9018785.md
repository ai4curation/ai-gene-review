stable_id: R-HSA-9018785
display_name: RHOBTB2 binds GTP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RHOBTB2 binds to GTP, but does not switch between GDP- and GTP-bound states
  (Manjarrez et al. 2014). ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone activity of the
  HSP90:CDC37 complex and binding of RHOBTB2 to the HSP90:CDC37 complex enables RHOBTB2
  to bind GTP (Manjarrez et al. 2014). There are no known RHOBTB2 GAPs - DEBDC1B was
  reported to bind RHOBTB2 by Bagci et al. 2020, but its RHOBTB2-directed GAP activity
  has not been tested.
