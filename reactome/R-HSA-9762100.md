stable_id: R-HSA-9762100
display_name: MYC- and NICD1-dependent NFE2L2 gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Oncogene-dependent upregulation of NFE2L2 expression has been shown to contribute
  to a number of cancers (Best et al, 2021; Tang et al, 2017; De Nicola et al, 2011;
  Mitsuishi et al, 2012; Wakabayashi et al, 2014; reviewed in He et al, 2020; Kitamura
  and Motohashi, 2018). Elevated NFE2L2 levels contribute to metabolic reprogramming,
  notably diverting carbon metabolism into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). PPP
  generates NADPH and intermediates that are needed for the synthesis of sterols,
  fatty acids and nucleic acids, and thereby supports proliferative growth and maintenance
  of redox balance (reviewed in Ge et al, 2020; Hayes et al, 2020).
