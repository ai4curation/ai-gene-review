summary: To catalyze DNA synthesis, retroviral reverse transcriptase requires a primer
  strand to extend and a template strand to copy. For HIV-1, the primer is the 3'-end
  of a partially unwound lysine(3) tRNA annealed to the PBS (primer binding site)
  179 bases from the 5' end of the retroviral genomic RNA (Isel et al. 1995). Reverse
  transcription of the viral genomic RNA proceeds from the bound tRNA primer to the
  5' end of the viral RNA, yielding a minus-strand strong-stop DNA (-sssDNA) complementary
  to the R and U5 elements of the HIV-1 viral genome, as shown in the figure below
  (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997; Jonckheere et al. 2000). The reaction takes place in
  the host cell cytosol, and is catalyzed by the reverse transcriptase activity of
  the HIV-1 RT heterodimer.<p>NucleoCapsid (NC) protein prevents self-priming by generating
  or stabilizing a thermodynamically favored RNA-DNA heteroduplex instead of the kinetically
  favored TAR hairpin seen in reverse transcription experiments in vitro (Driscoll
  and Hughes 2000).
