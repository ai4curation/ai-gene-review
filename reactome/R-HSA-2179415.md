stable_id: R-HSA-2179415
display_name: GRB2:SOS1 binds to HBEGF:p-Y-EGFR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cytoplasmic target proteins containing the SH2 domain can bind to activated
  EGFR. One such protein, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), can bind
  activated EGFR with its SH2 domain whilst in complex with SOS through its SH3 domain.
  GRB2 can bind at either Y1068 and/or Y1086 autophosphorylation sites on the receptor
  (Batzer et al. 1994, Okutani et al. 1994).
