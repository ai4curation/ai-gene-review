display_name: Ub-RibC-AXIN is degraded by the proteasome
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, polyubiquitinated forms
  of AXIN accumulate (Huang et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 2011; Callow et al, 2011).  This
  effect is abrogated by co-treatment of cells with both MG132 and inhibitors of tankyrase
  activity, suggesting that both PARSylation and ubiquitination are required for AXIN
  degradation (Huang et al, 2009).

## Summary

In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, polyubiquitinated forms of AXIN accumulate (Huang et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 2011; Callow et al, 2011).  This effect is abrogated by co-treatment of cells with both MG132 and inhibitors of tankyrase activity, suggesting that both PARSylation and ubiquitination are required for AXIN degradation (Huang et al, 2009).
