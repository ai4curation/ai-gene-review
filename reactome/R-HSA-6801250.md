display_name: TRIAP1:PRELID1, PRELID3A transports PA from the outer to the inner mitochondrial
  membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The complex of TP53-regulated inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (TRIAP1) and mitochondrial
  PRELI domain-containing protein 1 PRELID1 (TRIAP1:PRELID1) facilitates transport
  of phosphatidic acid (PA) from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial
  membrane. At the inner mitochondrial membrane, the PA is used for the synthesis
  of cardiolipin (CL). CL prevents the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria,
  thus playing an anti-apoptotic role (Potting et al. 2013). The complex between TRIAP1
  and PRELI domain containing protein 3A (PRELID3A) is suggested to perform the same
  PA transport activity (Miliara et al. 2015)
