display_name: Binding of GRB2:GAB1 complex to p-EGFRvIII mutant
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Direct binding of the GRB2:GAB1 complex to phosphorylated homodimers of EGFRvIII
  cancer mutant has not been tested. This complex is recruted to EGFR via GRB2 binding
  to phosphorylated tyrosine residues Y1068 and Y1086 (corresponding to Y1092 and
  Y1110, respectively, when counting from the first amino acid of the EGFR precursor,
  prior to cleavage of the 24-amino acid signal peptide at the N-terminus). Phosphorylation
  of Y1068 (i.e. Y1092) has been directly demonstrated in EGFRvIII mutant (Huang et
  al. 2007).
