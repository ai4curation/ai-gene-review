summary: 'Translation of NOTCH1 mRNA is negatively regulated by MIR449 microRNAs (MIR449A,
  MIR449B and MIR449C), which bind to the 3''UTR of NOTCH1. Downregulation of NOTCH1
  signaling by the MIR449 cluster appears to be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism

## Summary

Translation of NOTCH1 mRNA is negatively regulated by MIR449 microRNAs (MIR449A, MIR449B and MIR449C), which bind to the 3'UTR of NOTCH1. Downregulation of NOTCH1 signaling by the MIR449 cluster appears to be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism involved in regulation of vertebrate multiciliogenesis. DLL1 mRNA is also a target of the MIR449 cluster.
