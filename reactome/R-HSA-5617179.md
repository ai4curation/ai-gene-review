display_name: PRKACA phosphorylates TNNI3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Human cardiac troponin I (TNNI3) is known to be phosphorylated at multiple
  amino acid residue sites by several kinases. Protein kinase A (PRKACA) can phosphorylate
  serine 23 and 24 sites on TNNI3. Phosphorylation of TNNI3 reduces myofilament calcium
  sensitivity (Mittmann et al. 1990, Keane et al. 1997, Zhang et al. 2012). Defects
  in TNNI3 can cause a range of cardiomyopathies (Lu et al. 2013). The ATP2B4:NOS1
  complex, via cAMP, increases PRKACA activity, thereby regulating the response of
  the heart to beta-adrenergic agonists.
