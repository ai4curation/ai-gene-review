stable_id: R-HSA-1011600
display_name: Rabenosyn-5 connects  Rab5 to VPS-45
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The small GTPase Rab5 regulates membrane traffic into and between early endosomes
  by specifically recruiting cytosolic effector proteins to their site of action on
  early endosomal membranes. Rab5 occupies a restricted membrane subdomain on endosomes
  that has distinct biochemical features when compared with neighboring subcompartments
  (Sonnichsen et al. 2000). Rab5 is believed to form this subdomain by recruiting
  the specific PI3 kinase VPS-45, causing localized production of PI-3-phosphate (PI-3P)
  (Christoforidis et al. 1999).  Rabenosyn-5 is a Rab5 effector, recruited in a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  dependent fashion to early endosomes where it serves as a molecular link between
  VPS-45 and Rab5.
