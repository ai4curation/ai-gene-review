display_name: IL10 dimer:2xp-Y-IL10RA:p-Y-JAK1:2xIL10RB:p-Y-TYK2 binds STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT3 is recruited directly to the receptor complex via either of the two
  tyrosine residues in the IL10R1 cytoplasmic domain (Y446 and Y496) that become phosphorylated
  in response to IL-10 (Weber-Nordt et al. 1996, Riley et al. 1999). Overexpression
  of a dominant negative mouse Stat3 mutant or an inducibly-active form of mouse Stat3
  demonstrated that Stat3 activation is necessary and sufficient to mediate inhibition
  of macrophage proliferation by IL-10 (O'Farrell et al. 1998) at least in part via
  enhancement of CDKN2D (INK4d) and CDKN1A (CIP1) expression (O'Farrell et al. 2000).
  In contrast, the Stat3 mutant did not detectably impair IL-10's ability to inhibit
  LPS-induced monokine production suggesting that IL10 inhibition of macrophage proliferation
  and monokine production are the result of two distinct signaling pathways (O'Farrell
  et al. 1998). Stat3 conditional knockout mice develop chronic enterocholitis and
  have macrophages that show no response to IL10 (Riley et al. 1999, Takeda et al.
  1999).
