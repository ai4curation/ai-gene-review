display_name: Orc1 is phosphorylated by cyclin A/CDK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: At the beginning of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'ATP', and 1 molecule of
  'pre-replicative complex' are present. At the end of this reaction, 1 molecule of
  'phosphorylated Orc1', 1 molecule of 'pre-replicative complex (Orc1-minus)', and
  1 molecule of 'ADP' are present.<br><br> This reaction takes place in the 'nucleus'
  and  is mediated by the 'kinase activity' of 'Cyclin A:Cdk2 complex'.<br>
