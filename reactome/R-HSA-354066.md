summary: As integrins do not have an intrinsic catalytic activity, the signals initiated
  by the ECM-integrin interactions are transduced into cells through the integrin
  bound protein-tyrosine kinases. PTK2 (protein-tyrosine kinase 2, also known as Focal
  adhesion kinase 1; FADK1, FAK) is one of the protein tyrosine kinases that plays
  a prominent role in integrin signaling. PTK2 has been implicated in controlling
  cell motility and transmitting a cell survival signal from ECM. <br><br>PTK2 is
  recruited to sites of integrin clustering by directly binding to integrin associated
