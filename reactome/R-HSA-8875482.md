display_name: CBL recruits CIN85:endophilin to ubiquitinated MET
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CBL recruits the complex of SH3KBP1 (CIN85) and endophilin to the activated
  MET receptor. While CIN85 and endophilin are not involved in CBL tyrosine phosphorylation
  by activated MET and CBL-mediated MET ubiquitination, they are required for internalization
  and degradation of the activated MET receptor (Petrelli et al. 2002). CIN85 likely
  functions as a homotetramer (Watanabe et al. 2000). Endophilin A1 (SH3GL2), A2 (SH3GL1)
  and A3 (SH3GL3), which function as homodimers, can all be recruited to the activated
  MET receptor, with SH3GL3 being the most extensively studied (Petrelli et al. 2002).
