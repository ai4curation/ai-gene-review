stable_id: R-HSA-8848316
display_name: IL36 binds IL1RL2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-1 receptor-like 2 (IL1RL2) is a receptor for interleukin-36 (IL36A,
  IL36B and IL36G). After binding to interleukin-36 IL1RL2 associates with the coreceptor
  IL1RAP to form the interleukin-36 receptor complex which mediates interleukin-36-dependent
  activation of NF-kappa-B, MAPK and other pathways. IL1RL2 also binds Interleukin-1
  family member 10 (IL38, IL1F10) (van de Veerdonk et al. 2012). The biological function
  of IL1F10 is thought to be inhibition of IL36 binding to IL36R (Yuan et al. 2015,
  Yi et al. 2016).
