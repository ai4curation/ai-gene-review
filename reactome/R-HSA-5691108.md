stable_id: R-HSA-5691108
display_name: SKP1:FBXL5:CUL1:NEDD8 ubiquitinylates IREB2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cellular iron homeostasis is maintained by the coordinate posttranscriptional
  regulation of iron metabolism genes. The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing
  the F-box/LRR-repeat protein 5 (FBXL5) protein (SKP1:FBXL5:CUL1:NEDD8) targets iron-responsive
  element-binding protein 2 (IREB2) for proteasomal degradation in iron-replete cells
  (Vashisht et al. 2009, Salahudeen et al. 2009). Cullin-1 (CUL1) is in neddylated
  form (NEDD8) which allows it to associate with this complex.
