species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'FANCD2 and FANCI, the components of the ID2 complex, are monoubiquitinated
  at DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL-DNA) by the coordinated action of the E2 ubiquitin
  ligase UBE2T and the E3 ubiquitin ligase FANCL (Machida et al. 2006, Alpi et al.
  2007, Sims et al. 2007, Smogorzewska et al. 2007, Longerich et al. 2009, Sato et
  al. 2012, Hodson et al. 2014). FANCL achieves the maximal catalytic activity as
  part of the ICL-DNA-bound FA core complex, and requires the presence of at least
  FANCB and FAAP100 subunits of the FA core complex to monoubiquitinate the ID2 complex
  (Rajendra et al. 2014, Longerich et al. 2014). FANCD2 is monoubiquitinated on lysine
  residue K561, while FANCI is monoubiquitinated on lysine residue K523 (Alpi et al.
  2008, Longerich et al. 2014). In the absence of FANCD2, a DNA-bound FANCI can be
  monoubiquitinated in a FANCL-independent manner (Longerich et al. 2014).<p>UBE2T
  is also monoubiqutinated by FANCL on lysine residues K91 and K182 during the process
  of ID2 monoubiquitination. Monoubiquitination of UBE2T may serve as a self-inactivating
  mechanism that negatively regulates the Fanconi anemia pathway (Machida et al. 2006).<p>FANCD2
  monoubiquitination promotes stability of the ID2 complex and its retention at ICL-DNA,
