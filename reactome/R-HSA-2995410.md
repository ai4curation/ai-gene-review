display_name: Nuclear Envelope (NE) Reassembly
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Reassembly of the nuclear envelope (NE) around separated sister chromatids
  begins in late anaphase and is completed in telophase (reviewed by Wandke and Kutay
  2013). Characteristic proteins of the inner nuclear membrane and nuclear lamina
  accumulate at the reforming NE (reviewed by Wandke and Kutay 2013). Concurrently,
  nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) assemble and insert into the reforming NE, and the
  NE becomes sealed to reestablish the nucleocytoplasmic diffusion barrier (reviewed
  by Otsuka and Ellenberg 2018).
