stable_id: R-HSA-5655301
display_name: Activated FGFR2 mutants phosphorylate PLCG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: By analogy with the wild-type pathway, PLC-gamma is presumed to be phosphorylated
  by activated FGFR mutants, resulting in PLC-gamma activation, stimulation of phosphatidyl
  inositol hydrolysis and generation of two second messengers, diacylglycerol and
  inositol (1,4,5) P3.

## Summary

By analogy with the wild-type pathway, PLC-gamma is presumed to be phosphorylated by activated FGFR mutants, resulting in PLC-gamma activation, stimulation of phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis and generation of two second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol (1,4,5) P3.
