species: Homo sapiens
summary: After incorporation at the branch, the actin bound to VCA domain of WASP/WAVE
  undergoes ATP hydrolysis and this destabilizes its interaction with WASP/WAVE. This
  dissociates the branched junction from the membrane-bound WASP/WAVE (Kovar 2006).

# Detachment of WASP/WAVE
**Reactome ID:** [R-HSA-2197690](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-2197690)
**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

After incorporation at the branch, the actin bound to VCA domain of WASP/WAVE undergoes ATP hydrolysis and this destabilizes its interaction with WASP/WAVE. This dissociates the branched junction from the membrane-bound WASP/WAVE (Kovar 2006).
