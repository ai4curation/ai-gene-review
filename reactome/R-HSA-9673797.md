stable_id: R-HSA-9673797
display_name: NOX1 complex:pp-DVL:RAC1:GTP generates superoxide from oxygen
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The activity of the non-phagocytic NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) complex, composed
  of NOX1, NOXA1, NOXO1 and CYBA, is greatly enhanced upon RAC1:GTP binding, resulting
  in production of the superoxide O2- which can serve as a second messenger (Takeya
  et al. 2003, Miyano et al. 2006, Park et al. 2006, Cheng et al. 2006).
