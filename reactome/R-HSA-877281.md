stable_id: R-HSA-877281
display_name: PIAS1 binds p-STAT1 dimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PIAS1 protein interacts directly with phoshorylated STAT1 dimers and inhibit
  the transcriptional activity of STAT1 by blocking the DNA-binding domain of STAT1.
  It has also been suggested that PIAS proteins might regulate transcription by promoting
  small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO1) conjugation of STAT1. The significance
  of STAT1 sumoylation in regulating STAT1 activity is controversial and needs to
  be clarified.
