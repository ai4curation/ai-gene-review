summary: 'The human kinetochore, is a complex proteinaceous structure that assembles
  on centromeric DNA and mediates the association of mitotic chromosomes with spindle
  microtubules in prometaphase. The molecular composition of the human kinetochore
  is reviewed in detail in Cheeseman et al., 2008. This complex structure is composed
  of numerous protein complexes and networks including: the constitutive centromere-associated
  network (CCAN) containing several sub-networks such as (CENP-H, I, K), (CENP-50/U,
  O, P, Q, R), the KMN network (containing KNL1, the Mis12 complex, and the Ndc80
  complex), the chromosomal passenger complex, the mitotic checkpoint complex, the
  nucleoporin 107-160 complex and the RZZ complex. <br>At prometaphase, following
  breakdown of the nuclear envelope, the kinetochores of condensed chromosomes begin
  to interact with spindle microtubules.  In humans, 15-20 microtubules are bound
  to each kinetochore (McEwen et al., 2001), and the attachment of 15 microtubules
  to the kinetochore is shown in this reaction. Recently, it was found that the core
  kinetochore-microtubule attachment site is within the KMN network and is likely
  to be formed by two closely apposed low-affinity microtubule-binding sites, one
  in the Ndc80 complex and a second in KNL1 (Cheeseman et al., 2006). '
