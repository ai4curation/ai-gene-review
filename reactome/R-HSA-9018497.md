stable_id: R-HSA-9018497
display_name: Estrogen-responsive TFF3 gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Estrogen-dependent TFF3 expression is promoted by the formation of FOXA1-
  and GATA3-dependent chromatin loops.  Interaction of ligand-bound ESR1 with the
  enhancer promotes recruitment of EP300 and other chromatin modifying enzymes, and
  stimulates the deposition of active chromatin marks like H3K4 methylation and H3K27
  acteylation (Laganière et al, 2005; Theodorou et al, 2013; reviewed in Zaret and
  Carroll, 2011)
