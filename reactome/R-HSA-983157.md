species: Homo sapiens
summary: Ubiquitin E3 ligases confer specificity to ubiquitination by recognizing
  target substrates and mediating transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzyme to substrate (Raymond et al. 2009). E3 ligases includes a large, diverse
  set of proteins characterized by several defining motifs which include a HECT (homologous
  to E6-associated C-terminus), RING (Really Interesting New Gene) and U-box domains.
  The E3 ligases can be multisubunit complexes rather than a single polypeptide. Presently
  three different kinds of E3 complexes have been described called SCF, APC, and VHL.
  E3 ligases binds to both substrate and an E2 thioesterified with ubiquitin (E2-Ub).
