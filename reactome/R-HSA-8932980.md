stable_id: R-HSA-8932980
display_name: SERINC3,5,(1,2,4) transport L-Ser from cytosol to plasma membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Serine incorporators 1-5 (SERINC1-5) are membrane-associated proteins that
  incorporate the polar amino acid serine (L-Ser) into membranes and facilitate the
  synthesis of the serine-derived lipids phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids (nuzuka
  et al. 2005). SERINC3 and 5 have recently been identified to be restrictors to HIV
  replication in human cells (Fackler 2015, Usami et al. 2015).
