display_name: Epo:p-8Y-Epor:p-12Y-Jak2:Lyn:Irs2:p-Crkl:Rapgef1:p-Y-Shc1 binds Grb2-1:Sos1
species: Mus musculus
summary: Phosphorylated Shc1 in the Epor complex serves as a scaffold to bind Grb2
  (Cutler et al. 1993, Damen et al. 1993, Miura et al. 1994). Grb2 may be pre-associated
  with Vav1 or Sos1 (Barber et al. 1997), which are guanine nucleotide exchange factors
  for Ras, or with Cbl, an ubiquitin ligase. Shc1 and Grb2 may also be recruited by
  interacting with Ship1 bound to Epor (Mason et al. 2000)
