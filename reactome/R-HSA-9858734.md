stable_id: R-HSA-9858734
display_name: MITF-M-dependent TERT expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TERT encodes the telomerase responsible for maintenance of chromosome ends.
  TERT has been identified as a direct MITF target in melanoma cells by ChIP. Consistent
  with this, depletion of MITF causes a decrease in TERT mRNA by RNA seq and RT-qPCR
  (Strub et al, 2011). TERT is one of a number of potential MITF-dependent target
  genes involved in processes of DNA replication and damage repair (Strub et al, 2011;
  reviewed in Goding and Arnheiter, 2019)
