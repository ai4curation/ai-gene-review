display_name: Interaction of integrin alphaVbeta3 with IPSP (Bone sialoprotein 2)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Integrin alphaVbeta3 receptor has been implicated in various physiological
  and pathological responses, including bone density, angiogenesis, apoptosis, tumor
  growth and metastasis. <br>Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is a significant component of
  the bone extracellular matrix and plays an important role in bone resorption and
  osteoclast formation. BSP is considered as an important physiological ligand of
  alphaVbeta3 for osteoclast adhesion in bone development and mineralization.
