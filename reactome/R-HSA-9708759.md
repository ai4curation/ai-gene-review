summary: Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is the fourth, and rate-limiting enzyme
  in the de novo pyrimidine nucleosides biosynthetic pathway. DHODH's expression is
  selectively upregulated in proliferating and activated lymphocytes, making it a
  target susceptible to pharmacological inhibition in activated immune cells. Inhibition
  of DHODH causes a reduction in the available pyrimidine pool, which leads to metabolic
  stress and apoptosis in highly activated cells. DHODH inhibitors are used clinically
  to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Davis et al. 1996, Breedveld
  & Dayer 2000) and multiple sclerosis (Palmer 2010).<br><br>Novel potent inhibitors
  of human DHODH (S312, S416, vidofludimus and brequinar), as well as the existing
  drugs leflunomide and teriflunomide, all possess dual action of antiviral and immuno-regulation
  against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus, Zika virus, Ebola virus,
  and particularly against SARS-CoV-2. These drugs may have clinical potentials to
  cure SARS-CoV-2 or other RNA viruses (Xiong et al. 2020, Coelho & Oliveira 2020,
