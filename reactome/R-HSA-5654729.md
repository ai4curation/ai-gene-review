stable_id: R-HSA-5654729
display_name: p-CBL:GRB2 binds p-FRS2:activated FGFR2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ubiquitin ligase CBL exists in a complex with GRB2 and is recruited to
  tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2 after FGF stimulation.  In addition to promoting the
  ubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation of the activated receptor complex,
  recruitment of the p-CBL:GRB2 complex seems to attenuate FGFR signaling by competing
  with GRB2:SOS1 for binding to the direct GRB2-binding sites on p-FRS2.
