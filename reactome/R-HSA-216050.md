species: Homo sapiens
summary: Several integrins are able to bind fibronectin (FN1). Alpha5beta1 is a specialist
  FN1 receptor (Singh et al. 2010). The alpha4beta1 (VAL-4) integrin has been suggested
  to play an important role in haemopoiesis. Fibronectin and VCAM-1 are the main ligands
  for VLA-4. The H1 region present in all FN isoforms represents the binding site
  for VLA-4, alphaIIbBeta3, which is highly expressed on platelets where it predominantly
  binds fibrinogen leading to thrombus formation but also binds FN1 (Savage et al.
  1996). Alpha4beta1 mediates cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix contacts through
  the ligands VCAM-1 and FN1, respectively (Humphries et al. 1995), this is suggested
  to play an important role in haemopoiesis. The H1 region present in all FN isoforms
  represents the binding site for VLA-4. Integrins alpha3beta1, alpha4beta7, alphaVbeta1,
