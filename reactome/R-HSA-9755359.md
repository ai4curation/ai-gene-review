display_name: SARS-CoV-2 8:class I MHC binds BECN1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 (8), which has no orthologous protein in SARS-CoV-1 (Li T
  et al. 2020), was found to regulate the expression of class I MHC on the surface
  of the infected cells through an autophagy-dependent lysosomal degradation of class
  I MHC (Zhang Y et al. 2021). Viral 8 co-localized and co-immunoprecipitated with
  Beclin 1 (BECN1) upon coexpression of tagged proteins in human embryonic kidney
  293T (HEK293T) cells. SARS-CoV-2 8 failed to induce class I MHC degradation in BECN1-deficient
  cells (Zhang Y et al. 2021). The data suggest that 8 (ORF8) induces BECN1-dependent
  autophagy to degrade class I MHC (Zhang Y et al. 2021).
