stable_id: R-HSA-379974
display_name: leucine + tRNA(Leu) + ATP => Leu-tRNA(Leu) + AMP + pyrophosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: LARS (cytosolic leucyl tRNA synthetase) catalyzes the reaction of leucine,
  tRNA(Leu), and ATP to form Leu-tRNA(Leu), AMP, and pyrophosphate. The enzyme, a
  class I tRNA synthetase, is found in the cell as a component of the mutienzyme aminoacyl-tRNA
  synthetase complex (Ling et al. 2005).
