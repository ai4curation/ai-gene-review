stable_id: R-HSA-8937807
display_name: SRC phosphorylates RUNX3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated SRC phosphorylates RUNX3 in the cytosol, on multiple tyrosine residues.
  There are eleven tyrosine residues in RUNX3, but SRC target sites have not been
  determined. SRC-mediated phosphorylation of RUNX3 inhibits translocation of RUNX3
  to the nucleus and is the underlying cause of cytosolic localization of RUNX3 in
  gastric and breast cancer (Goh et al. 2010).
