display_name: Recruitment of dystrophin, dystrobrevin and syntrophin proteins to the
  DGC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once at the plasma membrane, the core cytosolic components of the assembling
  dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) are recruited. These include dystrophin (DMD)
  or related proteins utrophin (UTRN) or dystrophin-related protein 2 (DRP2), the
  dystrobrevin proteins (DTNA and/or DTNB) and member(s) of the syntrophin family
  (SNTA1, SNTB1, SNTB2, SNTG1 or SNTG2).<br>Dystrophin (DMD) is the largest known
  gene in the human genome at 2.4 million base pairs. It is widely expressed in brain,
  muscle, kidney lung and testis, and has multiple transcriptional isoforms (Lederfein
  et al, 1992; reviewed in Bhat et al, 2018). Dystrophin interacts with the cytosplasmic
  domain of transmembrane dystroglycan-beta (DAG1(654-895)), as well as with other
  components of the cytosolic DGC complex including the syntrophins SNTA1, SNTB1,
  SNTB2, SNTG1 and SNTG2, and dystrobrevins DTNA and DTNB (Chung and Campanelli, 1999;
  Huang et al, 2000; Jung et al, 1995; Ilsey et al, 2001; Ahn et al, 1995; Ahn et
  al, 1996; Sadoulet-Puccio et al, 1996; Sadoulet-Puccio et al, 1997; Suzuki et al,
  1994). Utrophin (UTRN, "ubiquitous dystrophin") is a dystrophin homologue that is
  widely expressed, particularly during embryogenesis and gradually replaced by dystrophin
  at birth. UTRN is retained in some tissues and can partially compensate for deletion
  of DMD (reviewed in Bhat et al, 2018). Dystrophin-related protein 2 (DRP2) is another
  DMD-related protein that is found in some DGC complexes, notably in Schwann cells
  (Yamada et al, 1994; Yamada et al, 1996; Sherman et al, 2001).<br>The C-terminal
  region of dystrophin interacts with two families of cytosolic proteins, the dystrobrevins
  and the syntrophins. Two genes code for dystrobrevin proteins, DTNA (dystrobrevin
  alpha, primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle) and DTNB (dystrobrevin
  beta, primarily expressed in brain, kidney and pancreas). Based on studies in mouse,
  DTN proteins additionally bind members of the syntrophin family in a manner that
  is independent of their DMD-binding (Blake et al, 1999; Peters et al, 1997; Madhavan
  and Jarrett, 1995; Yoshida et al, 2000).<br>There are five syntrophin genes in the
  human genome, alpha, beta 1, beta 2, gamma 1 and gamma 2, encoded by SNTA1, SNTB1,
  SNTB2, SNTG1 and SNTG2 respectively. SNTA1 is highly expressed in heart and skeletal
  muscle, SNTB1 and SNTB2 are widely expressed in many tissues and SNTG1 and SNTG2
  are predominantly expressed in brain, as well as in other tissue. The SNT proteins
  participate in the DGC complex as either monomers or dimers, and bind both to DTN
  proteins and directly to the C-terminal region of DMD (Peters et al, 1997; Madhavan
  and Jarrett, 1995; Loh et al, 2000). Syntrophin proteins additionally bind to numerous
  other proteins including kinases, sodium channels and nitric-oxide synthase, among
  others, and may work to help transmit mechanical stresses into signaling cascades
  (Gee et al, 1998; Hogan et al, 2001; Adams et al, 2001; Abdelmoity et al, 2000;
  Kobzik et al, 1994).
