display_name: AMBRA1:DYNLL1,DYNLL2 binds BECN1 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AMBRA1 (activating molecule in Beclin 1-related autophagy 1) is a mammalian
  scaffold protein that interacts with BECN1 (Beclin-1) in the Beclin-1 complex, which
  consists of BECN1, PIK3C3 (VPS34), PIK3R4 (VPS15) and ATG14. AMBRA1 promotes the
  interaction of BECN1 with PIK3C3 (Fimia et al. 2007). AMBRA1 can simultaneously
  bind dynein and the Beclin-1 complex. This anchors Beclin-1 complexes to the cytoplasmic
  microtubule network (Di Bartolomeo et al. 2010, Fimia et al. 2011). Downregulation
  of AMBRA1 increased staurosporine- or etoposide-induced apoptosis (Gu et al. 2014).
