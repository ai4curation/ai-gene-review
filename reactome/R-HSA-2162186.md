stable_id: R-HSA-2162186
display_name: COQ3 methylates DeMQ10H2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mitochondrial COQ3 is an O-methyltransferase required in the reaction to
  convert 3-demethylubiquinol-10 (DeMQ10H2) to ubiquinol-10 (Q10H2) (Jonassen & Clarke
  2000). Nicoll et al. (2024) confirmed the activity of COQ3 in an in vitro assay
  that comprised also COQ7 and COQ9, as it was not possible to study the methylation
  step on its own due to the instability of the short chain analog of DeMQ10H2.
