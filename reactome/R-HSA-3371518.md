display_name: SIRT1 binds to HSF1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Surtuin 1 (SIRT1) has been shown to bind HSF1 and to function as a regulator
  of HSF1 DNA binding activity by controling the acetylation status of HSF1 (Westerheide
  SD et al 2009). SIRT1 mediates NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylation.
