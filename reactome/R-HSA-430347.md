summary: 'Migfilin associates with actin filaments as a result of its interaction
  with filamin (Tu et al., 2003). Migfilin associates with actin filaments and  loss
  of migfilin decreases the level of F-actin suggesting  that,  in addition to providing
  an anchoring site for actin filaments at cell-ECM adhesions, migfilin also functions  in
  the regulation of filamin-mediated cross-linking and stabilization of actin filaments
  (Tu et al., 2003). '

## Summary

Migfilin associates with actin filaments as a result of its interaction with filamin (Tu et al., 2003). Migfilin associates with actin filaments and  loss of migfilin decreases the level of F-actin suggesting  that,  in addition to providing an anchoring site for actin filaments at cell-ECM adhesions, migfilin also functions  in the regulation of filamin-mediated cross-linking and stabilization of actin filaments (Tu et al., 2003).
