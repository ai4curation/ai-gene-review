display_name: Kazrin binds periplakin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Kazrin (KAZN) is an evolutionarily-conserved cytoplasmic and nuclear protein
  that was identified as a binding partner of periplakin (PPL), a component of epidermal
  desmosomes (DS) and the cornified envelope (CE) (Groot et al. 2004). <br><br>Kazrin
  has at least 5 different isoforms. Overexpression of the short isoform kazrinE stimulates
  the terminal differentiation of cultured human keratinocytes and is associated with
  a reduction in F-actin content, disruption of DS assembly, and changes in cell shape.
  Overexpression of activated RhoA rescues the effects on cell shape and adhesion.
  Conversely, knockdown of the longest isoform kazrinA impairs terminal differentiation,
  independently of RhoA activity (Sevilla et al. 2008a). KazrinE colocalizes with
  stabilized microtubules in differentiating keratinocytes (Nachat et al. 2009). All
  KAZN isoforms can form complexes with one another (Nachat et al. 2009), suggesting
  that like periplakin and envoplakin, it may form part of the cortical scaffold that
  integrates the actin cytoskeleton with DS (Ruhrberg et al. 1997, Kalinin et al.
  2001, Groot et al. 2004). In Xenopus embryos, depletion of endogenous KAZN results
  in striking defects in axial elongation, muscle and notochord differentiation, and
  epidermal morphogenesis. These effects are believed to be due to disruption of cell-cell
  junctions (Sevilla et al. 2008b, Cho et al. 2010). However, mice with a knockout
  that removes exons 5-15 of KAZN had normal epidermal morphogenesis and homeostasis
  (Chhatriwala et al. 2012).
