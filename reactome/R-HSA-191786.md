display_name: snRNP complex assembly
species: Homo sapiens
summary: To facilitate snRNP assembly, the SMN complex must bring together the Sm
  proteins and a Sm-site-containing snRNA. The SMN:Sm protein complex binds to the
  m7G capped snRNAs in the cytoplasm.<p>SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16)
  binds to the 5′ splice site recognition sequence of U1 snRNA and the branchpoint
  recognition site of U2 snRNA, both parts of the spliceosome, disrupting global mRNA
  splicing (Banerjee et al, 2020).
