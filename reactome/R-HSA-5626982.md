species: Homo sapiens
summary: Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-2-like 1 (GNB2L1), which
  is also known as a receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK1), interacts with
  NSMAF (FAN) in vitro as shown by glutathione S-transferase-based coprecipitation
  assays as well as coimmunoprecipitation experiments using human embryonic kidney
  293 (HEK293) cells (Tcherkasowa AE et al. 2002). Confocal laser-scanning microscopy
  studies suggest that overexpressed NSMAF (FAN) and GNB2L1 (RACK) colocalize at the
  plasma membrane together with TNFR1 (Tcherkasowa AE et al. 2002). Furthemore, isolation
  of TNF receptors containing vesicles from TNF-stimulated Jurkat or HeLa cells by
  help of biotinylated TNF and  MACS Streptavidin Microbeadsderived and coupled with
  immunoblotting assay showed that GNB2L1(RACK1) interacts with TNFR1 (Philipp S et
  al. 2010). The data suggest that GNB2L1(RACK1) modulates activation of neutral sphingomyelinase
  (N-SMASE) triggered by TNF.

Confocal laser-scanning microscopy studies suggest that overexpressed NSMAF (FAN) and GNB2L1 (RACK) colocalize at the plasma membrane together with TNFR1 (Tcherkasowa AE et al. 2002).
