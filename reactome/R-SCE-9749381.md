display_name: ATP-dependent release of CDT1 from the OCCM complex in budding yeast
species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
summary: In the budding yeast, once the initial complex of ORC(1-6), CDC6, CDT1 and
  MCM2-7 (OCCM) is formed, CDT1 is released from DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. The
  ATPase activity of CDC6 is necessary for CDT1 release, but ATPase activities of
  other ATPases in the complex (e.g. ORC1) may contribute to CDT1 release. ORC6 is
  necessary for the retention of MCM2-7 after ATP hydrolysis (Fernández-Cid et al.
  2013).
