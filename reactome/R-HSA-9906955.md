summary: Oxidase assembly 1-like protein (OXA1-like protein, OXA1L) catalyzes the
  cotranslational insertion of mitochondrial proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
  OXA1L is in complex with TMEM126A which stabilizes OXA1L. In particular, the Complex
  I subunit MT-ND4 has been shown to require OXA1L and TMEM126A for assembly with
  human Complex I (Stiburek et al., 2007; D'Angelo et al., 2021; Formosa et al., 2021;
  Poerschke et al., 2024).
