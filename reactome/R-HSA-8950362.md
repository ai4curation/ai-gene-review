species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-35 is a heterodimer of Interleukin-27 subunit beta (EBI3) and
  Interleukin-12 subunit alpha (IL12A or IL12-p35) (Devergne et al. 1997). It is required
  for maximal T regulatory cell activity (Collison et al. 2007).<br>Site directed
  mutagenesis of IL12A identified mutations that disrupt formation of Interleukin
  12 and Interleukin 27 heterodimeric complexes but not Interleukin 35. IL12A appears
  to pair with EBI3 entirely differently from IL27. (Jones et al. 2012). In the absence
  of IL12A, EBI3 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, associated with the chaperone
  Calnexin (CANX) (Devergne et al. 1997).<br>This is a Black Box event because we
  know that EBI3 is retained as a complex with CANX and the co expression of EBI3
  and IL12A enables their secretion, but we don't have evidence about the mechanism
  of dissociation of CANX from EBI3 (Devergne et al. 1997).<br><br>
