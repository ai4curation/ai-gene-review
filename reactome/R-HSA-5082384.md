stable_id: R-HSA-5082384
display_name: HSP70:DNAJB1 binds HSF1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: During attenuation and recovery from heat shock, increased levels of HSP70
  and HDJ1 (HSP40)  were found to associate with the HSF1 activation domain, repressing
  its transcriptional activity (Shi Y et al. 1998)
