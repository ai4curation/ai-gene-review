stable_id: R-HSA-212718
display_name: EGFR interacts with phospholipase C-gamma
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) can stimulate phosphatidylinositol
  (PI) turnover. Activated EGFR can activate phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1, i.e.
  PLCG1) which hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol
  1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 is instrumental in the release
  of calcium from intracellular stores and DAG is involved in protein kinase C activation.
