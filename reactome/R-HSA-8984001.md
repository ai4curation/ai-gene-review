display_name: IL35 binds IL27RA:IL12RB2 receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin 35 (IL35) is a heteromeric complex of Interleukin 12 subunit
  alpha (IL12A) and Interleukin 27 subunit alpha (IL27). IL35 can trigger the activation
  of the Janus Kinase (JAK) bound heterodimeric receptor composed of Interleukin 27
  receptor subunit alpha (Il27RA) and Interleukin 12 recetor subunit beta 2 (IL12RB2).
  JAKs are believed to be associated with the receptor before receptor activation
  (Behrmann et al., 2004). Consequently, IL12RB2:IL27RA facilitates the phosphorylation
  of STAT1:STAT3 heteromer downstream. Physiologically, this may result in the expansion
  of regulatory B cells and suppression of T and B cell proliferation. As it is not
  clear whether the dimeric receptor can form in the absence of ligand, formation
  of the receptor dimer is represented here as a black box event.
