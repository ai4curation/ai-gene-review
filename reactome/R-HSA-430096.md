species: Homo sapiens
summary: GP1b-IX-V interacts with filamin-1; within the cytoplasmic domain of GP1b
  alpha amino acids 557-568 and 569-579 are critical for this association. GPIb-filamin-1
  association links the receptor complex to the membrane skeleton and has been proposed
  to regulate the ability of GPIb-IX-V to adhere to vWf under conditions of high shear.
