display_name: Interaction of beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) chain with  class I HC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interaction of calnexin (CNX) with MHC class I HC stabilizes it and facilitates
  the association of the beta2 microglobulin component (B2M). The two chains are linked
  noncovalently via interaction of B2M and the alpha3 domain of MHC HC. After formation
  of the HC:B2M heterodimer, the MHC complex dissociates from CNX.
