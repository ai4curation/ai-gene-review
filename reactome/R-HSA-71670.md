## Summary

Cytosolic pyruvate kinase catalyzes the transfer of a high-energy phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, forming pyruvate and ATP.

Isozymes L and R are encoded by alternatively spliced transcripts of the PKLR gene; isozymes M1 and M2 are encoded by alternatively spliced transcripts of PKM2.
