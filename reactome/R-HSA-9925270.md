stable_id: R-HSA-9925270
display_name: CD274 mRNA binds miR-148a-3p RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA-148 (miR-148) plays a key role in regulating immune cell normal
  function like dendritic cell antigen presentation (Liu et al., 2010)  and Th1 cells
  differentiation (Haftmann et al., 2015. It promotes survival of repeatedly activated
  Th1 lymphocytes and regulation and differentiation of B lymphocytes (Friedrich et
  al., 2017). miR-148-3p regulates CD274 (PD-L1) expression by directly binding to
  the 3' UTR of PD-L1 mRNA, thereby suppressing its expression. This interaction was
  confirmed using luciferase reporter assays, where transfection with miR-148a-3p
  led to a decrease in luciferase activity, indicating direct binding to the PD-L1
  3' UTR (Fu et al., 2022; Ashizawa et al., 2019).
