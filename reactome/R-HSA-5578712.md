stable_id: R-HSA-5578712
display_name: Importin-8 binds AGO2:miRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Importin-8 (IPO8, IMP8, RANBP8) binds AGO2:miRNA complexes in the cytosol
  and participates in the importation of AGO2:miRNA complexes into the nucleus (Weinmann
  et al. 2009, Wei et al. 2014). IPO8 is also required for recruitment of AGO2:miRNA
  complexes to many target mRNAs in the cytosol and their efficient silencing (Weinmann
  et al. 2009). Moreover, other Argonautes (AGO1, AGO3, AGO4) are also observed in
  the nucleus (Kim et al. 2008, Weinmann et al. 2009, Ahlenstiel et al. 2012, Gagnon
  et al. 2014) and may be imported by the same mechanism.
