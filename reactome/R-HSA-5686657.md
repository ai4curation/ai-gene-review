stable_id: R-HSA-5686657
display_name: ERCC1:XPF cleaves flaps generated by SSA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The endonuclease complex ERCC1:XPF (ERCC1:ERCC4) is recruited to single strand
  annealing (SSA) sites of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair through direct interaction
  between XPF (ERCC4) and RAD52 (Motycka et al. 2004). ERCC1:XPF cleaves the ssDNA
  flaps generated by displacement of non-complementary 3' parts of 3' ssDNA overhangs
  during RAD52-mediated annealing. The enzymatic activity of ERCC1:XPF is necessary
  for the completion of SSA (Motycka et al. 2004, Al-Minawi et al. 2008, Ahmad et
  al. 2008).
