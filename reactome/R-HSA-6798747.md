display_name: Exocytosis of tertiary granule membrane proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Tertiary (gelatinase) granules are part of a continuum of peroxidase-negative
  granules formed in myelocytes, metamyelocytes, band cells and segmented neutrophils.
  They differ from secondary granules by having a low content of antimicrobial substances,
  and are more readily exocytosed (Sengelov et al. 1995). Tertiary granules are primarily
  a reservoir of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes and membrane receptors that
  are required for neutrophil extravasation and diapedesis (Faurschou & Borregaard
  2003).
