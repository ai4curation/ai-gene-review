display_name: CHIP (STUB1) mediates ubiquitination of ERBB2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (STUB1) mediates ERBB2 ubiquitination by associating
  with the ERBB2 indirectly, through the chaperone protein HSP90. CHIP (STUB1) ubiquitinates
  both ERBB2 and HSP90, leading to their proteasome-dependent degradation. Ubiquitination
  of ERBB2 by CHIP (STUB1) is independent of ERBB2 activation.

## Summary

E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (STUB1) mediates ERBB2 ubiquitination by associating with the ERBB2 indirectly, through the chaperone protein HSP90. CHIP (STUB1) ubiquitinates both ERBB2 and HSP90, leading to their proteasome-dependent degradation. Ubiquitination of ERBB2 by CHIP (STUB1) is independent of ERBB2 activation.
