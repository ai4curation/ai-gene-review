summary: 'Oncostatin M (OSM) is a multifunctional cytokine produced by bone microenvironment
  by cells of both mesenchymal and hematopoietic origin, including osteocytes, osteoblasts,
  macrophages and T lymphocytes (Brown et al. 1987, Malik et al. 1989). It belongs
  to the interleukin-6 (IL-6) subfamily and shares properties with all the members
  of the family but is closely related to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) structurally
  and functionally and it infact utilizes the LIF receptor (LIFR) in addition to its
  specific receptor OSMR. In humans, there are two types of functional OSM receptor
  complexes: the type I OSM receptor complex consisting of gp130 and LIF receptor
  (LIFR) subunits, and the type II OSM receptor complex consisting of gp130 and OSM
  receptor beta (OSMRbeta) subunits (Chen & Benveniste 2004, Thoma et al. 1994, Gomez-Lechon
  1999). Upon association with its specific receptor complexes OSM, then activates
  two major signaling pathways: Janus Kinase-Signal Transducers and Activators of
  Transcription (JAK-STAT) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), to regulate
  downstream events. OSM is involved in the regulation of complex cellular processes
  such as growth regulation, differentiation, gene expression, and cell survival in
  humans (Tanaka & Miyajima 2004).'
