display_name: Phosphorylation of TBSMs in LAT
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The adaptor molecule LAT (Linker for the Activation of T cells) is a membrane
  protein that links the TCR signal to the cell activation. It has a total 10 (Y36,
  Y45, Y64, Y110, Y156, Y161, Y200, Y220, and Y255) conserved TBSMs (tyrosine based
  signaling motifs) in its cytoplasmic region. These tyrosine residues are phosphorylated
  by the activated ZAP-70 upon TCR/CD3 complex engagement. Phosphorylation of LAT
  creates binding sites for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of other proteins, including
  PLC-gamma1, Grb2 and Gads, and indirectly binds SOS, Vav, SLP-76, and Itk. The residues
  Y200, Y220 and Y255 are responsible for Grb2 binding, Y200 and Y220 but not Y255,
  are necessary for Gads binding and Y161  for the PLC-gamma1 binding (numbering based
  on Uniprot isoform 1). '
