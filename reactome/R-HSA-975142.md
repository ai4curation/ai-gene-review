display_name: Pellino binds hp-IRAK1:TRAF6 upon TLR7/8 or 9 activation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Pellino isoforms -1, 2 and 3 have been shown to interact with IRAK1 and IRAK4
  (Jiang et al. 2003, Strellow et al. 2003, Butler et al. 2005, 2007). It has been
  also reported that Pellino-1 forms a complex with TRAF6, but not TAK1 or IL1R (Jiang
  et al. 2003), suggesting that Pellino-1 function as intermediate complex with IRAK1
  in the propagation of signal from the activated receptor to activation of TAK1.
  <p>All Pellino isoforms function as E3 ubiquitin ligases in conjunction with several
  different E2-conjugating enzymes - Ubc13-Uev1a, UbcH4, or UbcH5a/5b.(Schauvliege
  R et al. 2006, Butler MP et al. 2007, Ordureau A et al. 2008). Their C-terminus
  contains a RING-like domain which is responsible for IL1-induced Lys63-linked polyubiquitination
  of IRAK1 in vitro.
