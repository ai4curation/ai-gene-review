stable_id: R-HSA-9755303
display_name: 26S proteasome degrades HIFalpha
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Destruction of ubiquitinated HIF-alpha can occur in both the cytosol and
  nucleus (Berra et al. 2001). Upon reoxygenation of hypoxic cells HIF-alpha is ubiquitinated
  in the nucleus and transported to the cytosol in a complex with VHL:ElonginB:ElonginC:CUL2:RBX1
  where it is destroyed (Groulx and Lee 2002, Jaakkola et al. 2001, Ivan et al. 2001)
