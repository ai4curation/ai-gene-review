display_name: SPARC binds Collagen type I fibril, hydroxylapatite and Ca2+
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), also known as osteonectin
  or BM-40, binds Collagen type I, hydroxyapatite and Ca2+, suggesting a role in the
  mineralization of bone and cartilage (Termine et al. 1981). It is expressed by osteoblasts,
  odontoblasts, and many other cell types (Romanowski et al. 1990, Mundlos et al.
  1992, Papagerakis et al. 2002). SPARC expression has been used to follow the progression
  of osteoblast cytodifferentiation.
