display_name: CLPXP degrades mitochondrial matrix proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The CLPXP complex comprises two heptameric rings of the barrel-shaped CLPP
  protease and two hexameric rings of the AAA+ CLPX ATPase (Kang et al. 2002, 2005).
  Though isolated CLPP subunits have peptidase activity, they only have significant
  protease activity when complexed with CLPX (Kang et al. 2005). The CLPX subunit
  unfolds proteins so they can enter the axial pore of the CLPP protease (reviewed
  in Baker and Sauer 2012, Liu et al. 2014). The CLPXP complex binds and degrades
  several mitochondrial matrix proteins (Lee et al. 2021, Key et al. 2021), including
  ALAS1 bound to heme (Kubota et al. 2016, Nomura et al. 2021). CLPXP can also regulate
  proteins involved in bioenergetics such as components of the electron transport
  chain suggesting that it can regulate proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane
  (Seo et al. 2016, Ishizawa et al. 2019, Mabanglo et al. 2022). CLPXP is thought
  to be involved in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (inferred from C.
  elegans homologs in Haynes et al. 2007 and mouse homologs in Lian et al. 2023).
  Peptides produced by CLPXP are transported from the mitochondria into the cytosol
  and activate ATF5 (ATFS-1 in C. elegans). ATF5 subsequently translocates to the
  nucleus where it enhances the expression of mitochondrial proteases (CLPP and LONP1)
  and chaperones (HSP60 and GRP75) to restore proteostasis (inferred from C. elegans
  homologs in Haynes et al. 2010, inferred from mouse homologs in Deepa et al. 2016,
  Fiorese et al. 2016, inferred from rat homologs in Lian et al. 2023). Recessive
  mutations in the CLPP subunit of the CLPXP complex cause Perreault Syndrome, which
  is characterized by congenital sensorineural loss, ataxia, azoospermia (male infertility),
  ovarian failure, psychomotor retardation, ataxia, autism and epilepsy (Jenkinson
  et al. 2013, Demain et al. 2017, Faridi et al. 2022).

## Summary

The CLPXP complex comprises two heptameric rings of the barrel-shaped CLPP protease and two hexameric rings of the AAA+ CLPX ATPase (Kang et al. 2002, 2005). Though isolated CLPP subunits have peptidase activity, they only have significant protease activity when complexed with CLPX (Kang et al. 2005). The CLPX subunit unfolds proteins so they can enter the axial pore of the CLPP protease (reviewed in Baker and Sauer 2012, Liu et al. 2014).

CLPXP can also regulate proteins involved in bioenergetics such as components of the electron transport chain suggesting that it can regulate proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Seo et al. 2016, Ishizawa et al. 2019, Mabanglo et al. 2022).
