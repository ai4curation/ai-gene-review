stable_id: R-HSA-9948360
display_name: NEMF binds 60S ribosomal subunit:peptidyl-tRNA with nascent peptide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NEMF (the homolog of yeast RQC2) binds isolated 60S ribosomal subunits containing
  peptidyl-tRNAs and recruits Listerin (LTN1), a ubiquitin E3 ligase (Shao et al.
  2015). NEMF contacts both the 60S ribosomal subunit and the peptidyl-tRNA in the
  P site of the 60S subunit. The N-terminal region of LTN1 contacts NEMF while the
  C-terminal region contacts the 60S ribosomal subunit near the exit tunnel (Shao
  et al. 2015).
