display_name: Epsin family proteins bind ubiquitinated cargo
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Some membrane cargo is sorted into clathrin-coated pits after ubiquitination
  of the cytosolic domain (reviewed in Piper et al 2014). Ubiquitinated cargo is recognized
  by adaptor proteins such as EPS15, EPN1 and EPN2 that contain ubiquitin-binding
  domains and also interact with components of the clathrin coat (Chen et al, 1998;
  Rosenthal et al, 1999; Polo et al, 2002; Shih et al, 2002; Haglund et al, 2003;
  Schmid et al, 2006; reviewed in Sen et al, 2012; Piper et al, 2014).  A number of
  receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, VEGFR, FGFR and others undergo ubiquitination
  at the plasma membrane, triggering endocytosis.  Internalized RTKs can undergo recycling
  or degradation, the latter of which serves to terminate signaling (reviewed in Sorkin
  and von Zastrow, 2009; Haglund and Dikic, 2012).  Ubiquitin-based sorting into CCPs
  appears to be dynamic as deubiquitinases have been identified as components of some
  CCPs (Weinberg and Drubin, 2014).
