species: Homo sapiens
summary: The actions of androgens on the androgen receptors(AR) can potentiate the
  growth and survival of prostate cancer cells. AR antagonist drugs can competitively
  inhibit androgens from binding to AR, inhibit AR nuclear translocation, as well
  as AR-mediated transcription which can all result in a decrease in prostate cancer
  cell proliferation and tumour size (Furr & Tucker 1996, Hodgson et al. 2007, Tran
  et al. 2009, Fizazi et al. 2018, Fizazi et al. 2015, Clegg et al. 2012). Androgens
  can also contribute to the development of androgen-dependent conditions such as
  acne and alopecia. Clascoterone blocks the effects of androgens that bind AR to
  treat these conditions (Rosette et al. 2019 , Herbert et al. 2020).
