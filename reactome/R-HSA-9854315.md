display_name: CSKMT methylates Citrate Synthase
species: Homo sapiens
summary: (Citrate-synthase)-lysyl-methyltransferase (CSKMT, METTL12) transfers three
  methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to lysine-395 of citrate synthase
  (CS). The modification is evolutionarily conserved and attenuates the activity of
  CS by about 30% in vitro. The trimethylated form is predominant in most cell lines
  tested. Oxaloacetate and S-adenosylhomocysteine inhibit methyltransferase activity
  (Malecki et al., 2017; Rhein et al., 2017; reviewed in Qi et al., 2023).
