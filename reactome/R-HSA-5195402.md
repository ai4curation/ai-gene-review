stable_id: R-HSA-5195402
display_name: CDK1 phosphorylates LPIN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Lipins (LPIN1, LPIN2, LPIN3) possess several proline-directed phosphorylation
  sites that can be phosphorylated by CDK1 (Grimsey et al. 2008), including S106.
  Serine S106 in lipins is a preferred target for dephosphorylation by the evolutionarilly
  conserved CTDNEP1:CNEP1R1 complex (ortholog of yeast NEM1:SPO7 complex). Lipin phosphorylation
  regulates lipin localization, with phosphorylated lipins being soluble and dephosphorylated
  lipins being membrane-bound. The yeast ortholog of CDK1, CDC28, as well as human
  CDK1 can phosphorylate yeast lipin PAH1, inducing its dissociation from the nuclear
  envelope and endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Choi et al. 2011).
