display_name: STAT3 is phosphorylated downstream of active ALK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT3 is phosphorylated at tyrosine 705 downstream of active ALK and oncogenic
  ALK fusion proteins and contributes to cellular survival (Zamo et al, 2002; Zhang
  et al, 2002; Amin et al, 2003; Chiarle et al, 2003; Chiarle et al, 2005; Sattu et
  al, 2013; reviewed in Turner and Alexander, 2006; Chiarle et al, 2008; Palmer et
  al, 2009). Whether STAT3 activation downstream of ALK is mediated directly by the
  receptor itself or depends on JAK3 is controversial (Zhang et al, 2002; Han et al
  2006 a,b; Lai et al, 2005; Marzec et al. 2005; Shi et al, 2006; reviewed in Palmer
  et al, 2009). STAT3 is also phosphorylated at serine 727 in a manner that depends
  on the PI3K, mTOR and MAPK pathways. The functional significance of S727 phosphorylation
  is not entirely clear (Gambi et al, 2019). STAT3 supports cell survival by promoting
  the expression of a number of cell cycle and anti-apoptotic genes (reviewed in Chiarle
  et al, 2008).
