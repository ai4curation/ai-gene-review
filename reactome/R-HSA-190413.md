stable_id: R-HSA-190413
display_name: Autocatalytic phosphorylation of FGFR2c
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity of the activated FGFR2c receptor
  leads to multiple phosphorylation events, creating a number of binding sites on
  its cytoplasmic tail for membrane bound docking proteins to gather intracellular
  signaling mediators. Two isoforms of FGFR2c generated by alternative splicing and
  differing only by the presence ("long") or absence ("short") of two amino acid residues
  at positions 428-429 are equally active in autophosphorylation, but differ in their
  abilities to interact with downstream targets. Based on sequence alignment, FGFR2
  contains all 8 of the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues identified in FGFR1. <br>
