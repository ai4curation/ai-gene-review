display_name: Defective GALNT3 does not transfer GalNAc to mucins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The  family of UDP GalNAc:polypeptide N acetylgalactosaminyltransferases
  (GalNAc transferases, GALNTs) carry out the addition of N acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)
  on serine, threonine or possibly tyrosine residues on a wide variety of proteins,
  most commonly associated with mucins. This is the initial reaction in the biosynthesis
  of GalNAc-type O linked oligosaccharides (Wandall et al. 1997). This reaction takes
  place in the Golgi apparatus (Rottger et al. 1998). There are 20 known members of
  the GALNT family, 15 of which have been characterised and 5 candidate members which
  are thought to belong to this family based on sequence similarity (Bennett et al.
  2012). The GALNT-family is classified as belonging to CAZy family GT27. Defects
  in one of the GALNT family genes, GALNT3 (MIM:601756), can cause familial hyperphosphatemic
  tumoral calcinosis (HFTC; MIM:211900). HFTC is a rare autosomal recessive severe
  metabolic disorder characterised by the progressive deposition of calcium phosphate
  crystals in the skin, soft tissues and sometimes bone (Chefetz et al. 2005). The
  biochemical observation is hyperphosphatemia, caused by increased renal absorption
  of phosphate (Chefetz et al. 2005, Ichikawa et al. 2005). Some patients manifest
  recurrent, transient, painful swellings of the long bones with radiological evidence
  of periosteal reaction and cortical hyperostosis (Frishberg et al. 2005). Mutations
  in GALNT3 causing HFTC include more than 25 mutations (Ghafouri-Fard et al. 2015).
