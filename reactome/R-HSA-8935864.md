stable_id: R-HSA-8935864
display_name: miR-302b binds RUNX1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mature single stranded microRNA miR-302b-3p, one of the two products of miR-302b
  encoded by the MIR302B gene, binds to the 3'UTR of RUNX1 mRNA, which results in
  decreased RUNX1 mRNA and protein levels. As it affects RUNX1 mRNA levels, miR-302b
  is assumed to function as a component of the endonucleolytic RISC, but it is possible
  that it additionally functions as a component of the nonendonucleolytic RISC. Levels
  of miR-302b are decreased in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (Ge et al. 2014).
