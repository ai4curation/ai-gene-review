stable_id: R-HSA-452515
display_name: Expression of STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The STAT3 gene is transcribed to yield mRNA and the mRNA is translated to
  yield protein. STAT3 is expressed in embryonic stem cells (Schuringa et al. 2002,
  Fong et al. 2008). POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, and NANOG bind the promoter of the STAT3
  gene and enhance transcription (Boyer et al. 2005, Greber et al. 2007, Fong et al.
  2008). The binding site of POU5F1 is adjacent to the binding site of SOX2 in the
  STAT3 promoter (Boyer et al. 2005). Signaling by LIF via STAT3 in murine but not
  human stem cells is sufficient to prevent differentiation (Schuringa et al. 2002,
  Humphrey et al. 2004, Daheron et al. 2004).
