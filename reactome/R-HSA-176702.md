summary: At some point in the extension process a sufficient number of regulatory
  factors that repress telomere extension become bound to the extending telomere.
  These factors include the TRF1 complexes, TRF2 complexes, telomerase, other factors,
  and the telomere itself. As repeats are added to the G-rich strand, and once lagging
  strand synthesis completes the duplex, new binding sites become available for these
  repressive factors. Once a balance is reached between telomere extension and the
  telomere repression factors, extension ceases. In this state extension machinery
  disassociates, leaving the telomere to be folded into a stable conformation.<P>This
  module details a single transit through the telomere extension process, detailing
  the addition of two repeats, and the corresponding synthesis of a section of lagging
  strand. An actual round of <i>in vivo</i> telomere extension would require thousands
  of telomere repeat additions, and it is the repressive effect of the factors bound
  to these repeats that turns off telomere extension (Moldovan et al. 2007).
