display_name: ATP hydrolysis by RHOBTB3 promotes PLIN3 dissociation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATP hydrolysis by RHOBTB is thought to promote uncoating of the late endosome-derived
  vesicle, releasing PLIN3/TIP47 in preparation for vesicle fusion (Espinosa et al,
  2009; reviewed in Pfeffer, 2011).
