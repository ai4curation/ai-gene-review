display_name: 14-3-3 zeta binding allows recruitment of PI3K
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Immunoprecipitation and kinase activity experiments demonstrated that Ser-585
  phosphorylation of the common beta chain (Bc) was required for activation of PI3K
  activity in response to IL-3 and co-precipitation of Bc, 14-3-3 zeta and the p85
  subunit of Class 1A PI3 kinases (Guthridge et al. 2000). Subsequent experiments
  confirmed that Ser-585 phosphorylation and  PI3K activation are required to promote
  cell survival in response to GM-CSF, but not for proliferation responses, and that
  this mechanism is independent of Bc tyrosine phosphorylation (Guthridge et al. 2004).
  This is one of two mechanisms described for the recruitment of PI3K to the IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF
  receptors; the other involves Bc tyrosine-593 phosphorylation-mediated recruitment
  of SHC1, GRB2 and GAB2.
