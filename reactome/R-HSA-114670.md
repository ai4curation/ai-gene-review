stable_id: R-HSA-114670
display_name: GPIb-IX-V binds to vWF:Collagen complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The initial tethering of platelets at sites of vascular injury is mediated
  by a receptor complex of glycoproteins 1b, IX and V (GP1b:IX:V - frequently referred
  to as the GPIb receptor). The GP1b component binds to von Willebrand factor (VWF)
  complexed with collagen exposed in vascular epithelium following injury. In conditions
  of high shear stress, when a blood vessel is partially blocked, VWF can bind to
  GP1b:V:IX in absence of collagen, a major factor in heart attack and stroke. GPIb:IX:V
  interaction with VWF:collagen potentiates the binding of platelet-associated integrin
  αIIbβ3 to VWF and fibrinogen, triggering stable platelet adhesion and generation
  of further signals that lead to platelet aggregation.
