stable_id: R-HSA-427514
display_name: eNoSC deacetylates histone H3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) component of eNoSC deacetylates histone H3 at lysine-9
  (Vaquero et al. 2004, Murayama et al. 2008). The reaction uses nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide (NAD) as the acceptor of the acetyl group and generates nicotinamide
  and 1-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose as products (Vaquero et al. 2004). The use of NAD links
  the reaction to the overall energy balance of the cell. Cells exposed to high glucose
  have a greater NADH:NAD ratio and therefore lower activity of eNoSC (Murayama et
  al. 2008). Low glucose produces higher NAD and higher activity of eNoSC.
