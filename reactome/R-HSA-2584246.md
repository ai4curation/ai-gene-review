display_name: GNAT1-GTP hydrolyses its bound GTP to GDP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Active Gt alpha (GNAT-GTP) can be inactivated by a slow, intrinsic GTPase
  activity that hydrolyses GTP to GDP. Once GNAT1 has GDP bound, it no longer binds
  to the gamma subunit of PDE6 (PDE6-gamma) that then resumes inhibition of the catalytic
  subunit of PDE6. The hydrolysis of GTP is accelerated by a GAP (GTPase accelerating
  protein) complex that consists of Regulator of G protein signaling 9 (RGS9-1, RGS9
  isoform 3) (He et al. 1998, Zhang et al. 1999), Guanine nucleotide binding protein
  subunit beta 5, long form (GNB5) (Makino et al. 1999) and RGS9 anchoring protein
  (RGS9BP, aka R9AP) (Hu & Wensel 1998). The affinity of GNAT GTP for the GAP complex
  is relatively low, but is increased significantly by the presence of PDE-gamma.
  Shutoff of Gt is the rate-limiting step in the recovery of the single photon response
  of rods (Chen et al. 2000, Krispel et al. 2006). Persons with defective GAP experience
  bradyopsia or "slow vision" in which there are difficulties in adjusting to changes
  in brightness and to tracking moving objects (Michaelides et al. 2010, Nishiguchi
  et al. 2004).

## Summary
