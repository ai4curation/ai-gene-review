summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a key regulator
  of gene expression in response to signaling of many cytokines including interleukin-6
  (IL6), Oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Using microarray techniques,
  hundreds of genes have been reported as potential STAT3 target genes (Dauer et al.
  2005, Hsieh et al. 2005). Some of these genes have been proven to be direct STAT3
  targets using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation screening (Snyder et al.
  2008, Carpenter & Lo 2014). Genes encoding nuclear proteins that are downregulated
  by STAT3 include Necdin (NDN) (Haviland et al. 2011) and Cellular tumor antigen
  p53 (TP53) (Niu et al. 2005).
