summary: This Reactome event describes factor XI (FXI) binding to the glycoprotein
  Ib complex (GPIb:IX:V, GP1BA:GP1BB:GP9:GP5) on the platelet surface. Specifically,
  the A3 domain of FXI binds to the leucine-rich repeat in the NH2-terminal of GPIbα
  (GP1BA), facilitating FXI-platelet association (Baglia FA et al., 2004a, b). Supporting
  evidence from studies using angiotensin II–infused mice demonstrates that GPIbα-dependent,
  platelet-localized FXI is essential for thrombin-FXIa feedback activation in vivo
  (Kossmann S et al., 2017). <p>Plasma FXI, encoded by the F11 gene, circulates as
  an inactive homodimeric zymogen, with its subunits stabilized by disulfide bonds
  (Wu W et al., 2008; Mohammed BM et al., 2018). Unlike other vitamin K-dependent
  clotting factors, FXI lacks the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain, a calcium-binding
  domain essential for a binding to phospholipid membranes. Instead, FXI associates
  with cell surfaces through receptor-mediated interactions. On the cell surface,
  FXI is converted to activated factor XI (FXIa) through proteolytic cleavage at Arg387-Ile388
  within its protease domain. In the body, this reaction occurs primarily on the surfaces
  of activated platelets via interactions between FXI and platelet receptors, including
  glycoprotein Ib (GPIb:IX:V) complex, glycoprotein IV (CD36), and apolipoprotein
  E receptor 2 (ApoER2) (Greengard JS et al. 1986; Baird TR and Walsh PN 2002; Baglia
  FA et al., 2004a, b; White-Adams TC et al., 2009; Emsley J et al., 2010; Kossmann
  S et al., 2017; Mohammed BM et al., 2018; Reitsma SE et al., 2021). Binding to the
  platelet surface appears to shield FXIa from inactivation by platelet-derived inhibitors
  (Reitsma SE et al., 2021). Studies showed that while FXI and FXIa can interact with
  endothelial cell (EC) surface via high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) or directly
  in its absence, these interactions do not significantly contribute to thrombin generation
  (Shariat-Madar Z et al., 2001; Mahdi F et al., 2003; Puy C et al., 2024, reviewed
  by Pathak M et al., 2018; Lira AL et al., 2024). Additionally, FXI can also be activated
  upon binding to negatively charged surfaces, such as polyphosphate secreted from
  the dense granules of activated platelets (Choi SH et al., 2011; Geng Y et al.,
  2013).
