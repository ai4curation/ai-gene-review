stable_id: R-HSA-5654397
display_name: Activated FGFR2 phosphorylates FRS2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FRS2 (also known as FRS alpha  is activated through tyrosine phosphorylation
  catalyzed by the protein kinase domain of the activated FGFR.  FRS2 contains four
  binding sites for the adaptor protein GRB2 at residues Y196, Y306, Y349 and Y392,
  and two binding sites for the protein tyrosine phosphatase PPTN11/SHP2 at residues
  Y436 and Y471.  Different FGFR isoforms may generate different phosphorylation patterns
  on FRS2 leading to alternate downstream signaling.
