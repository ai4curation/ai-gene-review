display_name: Elastin cross-linking by lysyl oxidase
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Soluble monomers of tropoelastin are cross-linked by the oxidative deamination
  of lysine residues, catalyzed by lysyl oxidase (LOX). The first step in the cross
  linking reaction is the oxidative formation of the delta-aldehyde, known as alpha
  aminoadipic semialdehyde or allysine (Partridge 1963). Subsequent spontaneous reactions
  lead to the formation of cross-links through dehydrolysinonorleucine and allysine
  aldol, a trifunctional cross-link dehydromerodesmosine and two tetrafunctional cross-links
  desmosine and isodesmosine (Lucero & Kagan 2006), which are unique to elastin.
