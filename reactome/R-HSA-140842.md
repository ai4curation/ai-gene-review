summary: Thrombin-mediated proteolytic cleavage in the central E domain of fibrinogen
  results in the release of fibrinopeptides A and B from the N-terminal regions of
  the α and β chains of fibrinogen, respectively, leading to the formation of a soluble
  fibrin monomer (Ni et al. 1989; Pechik I et al., 2006; Riedel T et al., 2011). The
  cleavage unmasks four binding sites in the E domain of monomeric fibrin allowing
  binding to the C-terminal region of the D domain from other fibrin monomers (Everse
  SJ et al., 1998, 1999; Doolittle RF 2003; Litvinov RI et al., 2005, 2007). Fibrin
  monomers rapidly and spontaneously associate into large multimers, which elongate
  into protofibrils that later aggregate to form fibers, creating a three-dimensional
  network (Laudano AP and Doolittelle RF 1980; Huang L et al., 2014; Zhmurov A et
  al., 2016; Litvinov RI et al., 2018; Asquith NL et al., 2022; Pietsch K et al. 2023;

  for the mechanical properties of the clot (Litvinov RI & Weisel JW 2017; Risman
  RA et al., 2024; reviewed by Feller T et al., 2022). The process of multimerization,
  and the range of multimer structures that can form in vivo and in vitro, have been

## Summary

Thrombin-mediated proteolytic cleavage in the central E domain of fibrinogen results in the release of fibrinopeptides A and B from the N-terminal regions of the α and β chains of fibrinogen, respectively, leading to the formation of a soluble fibrin monomer (Ni et al. 1989; Pechik I et al., 2006; Riedel T et al., 2011).
