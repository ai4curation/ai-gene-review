display_name: Defective EXT1 (in EXT1:EXT2) does not transfer GlcA to heparan
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Exostosin 1 and 2 (EXT1 and 2) are dual-specific glycosyltransferases required
  to form heparan sulfate (HS) which is involved in regulating various body functions
  during development, homeostasis and pathology including blood clotting, angiogenesis
  and metastasis of cancer cells. They are able to transfer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)
  and glucuronate (GlcA) to HS during its synthesis. Defects in EXT1 can cause hereditary
  multiple exostoses 1 (MIM:133700), an autosomal dominant disorder characterised
  by multiple projections of bone capped by cartilage resulting in deformed legs,
  forearms and hands (Petersen 1989). Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome, type II (TRPS2
  aka Langer-Giedion syndrome, LGS) is a disorder that combines the clinical features
  of trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I (TRPS1, MIM:190350) and multiple exostoses
  type I, caused by mutations in the TRPS1 and EXT1 genes, respectively (Langer et
  al. 1984, Ludecke et al. 1995; not annotated here). Defects in EXT1 such as frameshift
  mutations S478Lfs*43 and p.K177Efs*9 may also be responsible for chondrosarcoma
  (CHDS; MIM:215300) (Hecht et al. 1997; not annotated here).<br><br>Mutations that

## Summary

Exostosin 1 and 2 (EXT1 and 2) are dual-specific glycosyltransferases required to form heparan sulfate (HS) which is involved in regulating various body functions during development, homeostasis and pathology including blood clotting, angiogenesis and metastasis of cancer cells. They are able to transfer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucuronate (GlcA) to HS during its synthesis.
