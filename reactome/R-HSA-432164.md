stable_id: R-HSA-432164
display_name: Ca2+ influx into the post-synaptic cell
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NMDA receptors are activated upon binding of two ligands, glutamate and glycine
  or D-serine. The activation leads to Ca2+ influx into the post-synaptic cell. The
  local rise in the Ca2+ ion concentration further leads to activation of several
  Ca2+ dependent pathways leading to long term changes in the synapse (Cairns et al.
  2003, reviewed by Luscher and Malenka 2012 and Sanz-Clemente et al. 2013).
