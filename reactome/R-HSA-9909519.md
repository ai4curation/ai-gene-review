summary: Interferon-induced protein 44 (IFI44) and IFI44-like (IFI44L) are type I
  IFN-stimulated regulators of immune responses. Both IFI44 and IFI44L interact with
  FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5, also known as FKBP51), an immunophilin protein that
  functions as a HSP90-associated co-chaperone (DeDiego ML et al., 2019a, b). FKBP5,
  in turn, interacts with kinases, such as CHUK (IKKα), IKBKB (IKKβ), and IKBKE (IKKε),
  promoting their kinase activity in response to various stimuli (Romano S et al.,
  2015; Kästle M et al., 2018; Hao W et al., 2020). By binding to FKBP5, IFI44L and
  IFI44 are thought to inhibit phosphorylation of key signaling molecules IkBa and
  IRF3 by the IKK complex (CHUK:IKBKB:IKBKG) and IKBKE, respectively, suppressing
  induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine and type I IFN responses (DeDiego ML et al.,
  2019a, b). Further, IFI44L has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in certain
  cancers such as human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it influences cancer
  stemness, metastasis, and drug resistance through the regulation of the Met/Src
  signaling pathway (Huang WC et al., 2018). These findings suggest that both IFI44
  and IFI44L play crucial roles in inhibiting cell growth and promoting antiproliferative
  effects in cancer and during infections. On the other hand, IFI44L acts as an antimicrobial
  modulator that restricts the intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  in human macrophages (Jiang H et al., 2021). Additionally, IFI44 and IFI44L are
  identified as antiviral genes that are upregulated to restrict respiratory syncytial
  virus (RSV) infection (Busse DC et al., 2020) and SARS-CoV2 infection (Pekayvaz
  K et a., 2022). In the nucleus of HIV-1 infected cells, IFI44 binds to the HIV-1
  LTR promoter to suppress viral transcription (Power D et al., 2015). The data suggest
  that both IFI44 and IFI44L are multifaceted regulators of immune responses across
  various normal and pathological contexts.<p>This Reactome event shows binding of
  FKBP5 to either IFI44 or IFI44L.
