stable_id: R-HSA-5665767
display_name: Activated FMNL3 binds G-actin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated FMNL3 (presumably associated with RHOC:GTP) has the ability to
  directly bind G-actin through knob and coiled-coil subdomains of the FMNL3 FH2 domain.
  The proline-rich FH1 domain which precedes the FH2 domain presumably interacts with
  profilins bound to G-actin (Romero et al. 2004, Kovar et al. 2006, Kuhn and Geyer
  2014). FMNL3 contributes to the elongation of actin filaments (Heimsath and Higgs
  2012, Thompson et al. 2013). Activated FMNL3 may also trigger microtubule alignment
  during angiogenesis (Hetheridge et al. 2012).
