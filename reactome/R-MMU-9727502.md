display_name: Piwil4:piRNA binds nascent RNA transcript and recruits Spocd1, Gm52993
  (C19orf84), Dnmt3a, Dnmt3c, Dnmt3l, the NURD complex, and the BAF complex
species: Mus musculus
summary: In mouse fetal gonocytes undergoing de novo DNA methylation, piRNA-bound
  Piwil4 (Miwi2) associates with complementary, nascent RNA of retroelements such
  as the LINE1 family and with Spocd1, which interacts via Gm52993 (C19orf84), the
  DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a, the transposon-specific DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3c,
  the regulatory subunit Dnmt3l (Zoch et al. 2024) and components of the BAF and NURD
  chromatin remodelling complexes (Zoch et al. 2020). Spocd1 and Gm52993 are required
  for de novo DNA methylation of transposable elements, which are sources of piRNAs
  (Zoch et al. 2020, Zoch et al. 2024). Transcription of transposable elements during
  transient genome-wide demethylation during gametogenesis thus leads, via piRNAs,
  Piwil4, and Spocd1, to establishment of DNA methylation at pre-existing and newly
  transposed elements.

## Summary

In mouse fetal gonocytes undergoing de novo DNA methylation, piRNA-bound Piwil4 (Miwi2) associates with complementary, nascent RNA of retroelements such as the LINE1 family and with Spocd1, which interacts via Gm52993 (C19orf84), the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a, the transposon-specific DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3c, the regulatory subunit Dnmt3l (Zoch et al. 2024) and components of the BAF and NURD chromatin remodelling complexes (Zoch et al. 2020). Spocd1 and Gm52993 are required for de novo DNA methylation of transposable elements, which are sources of piRNAs (Zoch et al. 2020, Zoch et al. 2024). Transcription of transposable elements during transient genome-wide demethylation during gametogenesis thus leads, via piRNAs, Piwil4, and Spocd1, to establishment of DNA methylation at pre-existing and newly transposed elements.
