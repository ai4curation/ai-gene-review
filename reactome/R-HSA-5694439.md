display_name: COPII coat binds TRAPPCII and RAB1:GDP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRAPPC is a multi-subunit tethering complex that facilitates ER-to-Golgi
  traffic (reviewed in Barrowman et al, 2010; Brunet and Sacher, 2014).  TRAPPC is
  a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for RAB1 and is recruited to ER-derived vesicles
  by virtue of an interaction between the TRAPPC component TRAPPC3 and the coat protein
  SEC23 (Cai et al, 2007; Lord et al, 2011).
