display_name: Dnmt1 methylates cytosine in hemimethylated DNA
species: Mus musculus
summary: Dnmt1 transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the 5-position
  of the cytosine ring of cytosine residues in DNA. Dnmt1 contains a catalytic C-terminal
  domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain (Bestor et al. 1988), and alone has an
  approximately 15-fold preference for methylating hemimthylated CG dinucleotides
  relative to unmethylated dinucleotides in DNA (Bestor and Ingram 1983, Gowher et
  al. 2005, Svedruzic et al. 2005, Vilkaitis et al. 2005, Goyal et al. 2006). Interaction
  with Uhrf1 (Np95) specifically increases the activity of Dnmt1 on hemimethylated
  DNA (Berkyurek et al. 2014). Structural analysis indicates that the hemimethylated
  cytosine residue is bound to a shallow hydrophobic concave surface of Dnmt1 while
  the substrate cytosine is covalently bound to the catalytic pocket (Song et al.
  2012).
