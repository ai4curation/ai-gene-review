display_name: CD274 mRNA binds miR-200B/C RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: microRNA-200 family of microRNAs play an important role in T cell function
  regulation in normal and disease conditions like cancers (Humphries et al., 2015).
  In the context of PD-L1 expression regulation, microRNA-200b (miR-200b) suppresses
  the CD274 (PD-L1) translation by directly binding to the 3’UTR of the PDL1 mRNA.
  Co-transfection of a wild‑type PD‑L1 3’‑UTR luciferase reporter construct and miR‑200b
  or miR‑200c into murine (344SQ) or human (H157 or H1299) lung cancer cells, which
  have low endogenous levels of miR‑200, resulted in reduced luciferase reporter activity,  demonstrating
  that PD‑L1 is directly regulated by microRNA‑200 (Chen et al., 2014, Katakura et
  al., 2020)
