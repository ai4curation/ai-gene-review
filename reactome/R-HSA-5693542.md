display_name: Association of RPA complexes with ssDNA at resected DNA DSBs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Human replication protein A (RPA) is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding
  protein complex required for DNA replication, recombination, and repair. RPA is
  a stable heterotrimer consisting of subunits with molecular masses of 14, 32 and
  70 kDa (p14, p32 and p70, respectively). Association of RPA with ssDNA is thought
  to contribute to both the protection and removal of secondary structure from single-stranded
  DNA (ssDNA) (McIlwraith et al. 2000). The RPA complexes coat 3'-ssDNA overhangs
  generated by RBBP8 (CtIP)-initiated long-range resection of DNA double-strand breaks
  (DSBs) (Sartori et al. 2007, Chen et al. 2008).
