species: Homo sapiens
summary: The PEX19:PEX3:peroxisomal membrane protein complex dissociates, yielding
  cytosolic PEX19, membrane-bound PEX3, and the peroxisomal membrane protein inserted
  in the peroxisomal membrane (Fang et al. 2004, Matsuzono and Fujiki 2006, Schueller
  et al. 2010, Chen et al. 2014, reviewed in Fujiki et al. 2006). The mechanism of
  the reaction is not fully characterized. One current model posits the transfer of
  the peroxisomal membrane protein from a hydrophobic region of PEX19 to a hydrophobic
  region of PEX3 followed by intervention in the membrane layer to release the peroxisomal
  membrane protein into the membrane bilayer (Chen et al. 2014). An amphipathic helical
  segment in the N-terminal region of PEX19 may compete with the peroxisomal membrane
  protein for a binding site in the C-terminal region of PEX19 and thereby participate
  in the release of the peroxisomal membrane protein from PEX19 (Schueller et al.
  2010).
