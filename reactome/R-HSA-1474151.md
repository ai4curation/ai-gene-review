species: Homo sapiens
summary: Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential co-factor for the aromatic amino
  acid hydroxylases and glycerol ether monooxygenase and it regulates nitric oxide
  synthase (NOS) activity. Inherited BH4 deficiency leads to hyperphenylalaninemia,
  and dopamine and neurotransmitter deficiency in the brain. BH4 maintains enzymatic
  coupling to L-arginine oxidation to produce NO. Oxidation of BH4 to BH2 results
  in NOS uncoupling, resulting in superoxide (O2.-) formation rather than NO. Superoxide
  rapidly reacts with NO to produce peroxynitrite which can further uncouple NOS.<br>These
  reactive oxygen species (superoxide and peroxynitrite) can contribute to increased
  oxidative stress in the endothelium leading to atherosclerosis and hypertension
  (Thony et al. 2000, Crabtree and Channon 2011,Schulz et al. 2008, Schmidt and Alp
  2007).  The synthesis, recycling and effects of BH4 are shown here. Three enzymes
  are required for the de novo biosynthesis of BH4 and two enzymes for the recycling
  of BH4.
