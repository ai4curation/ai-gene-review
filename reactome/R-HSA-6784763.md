display_name: p-Y705-STAT3 dimer translocates from cytosol to nucleoplasm
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The classical model of JAK-STAT signaling suggests that phosphorylated Signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) translocates to the nucleus
  (Akira et al. 1994) where it binds DNA to mediate the effects of Interleukin-10
  (IL10) on expression of cytokines, soluble mediators and cell surface molecules
  by cells of myeloid origin, with important consequences for their ability to activate
  and sustain immune and inflammatory responses. STAT3 is able to shuttle freely between
  the cytoplasm and the nucleus, independent of tyrosine phosphorylation (Liu et al.
  2005, Li 2008, Reich 2013). Binding of unphosphorylated STAT3 to DNA has been reported
  (Nkansah et al. 2013). As it is not clear what triggers nuclear accumulation of
  STAT3 in response to IL10 this event is shown as an uncertain process.
