display_name: Elongation of arachidonyl-CoA to docosatetraenoyl-CoA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Arachidonyl-CoA undergoes a two-carbon chain elongation on the carboxyl end
  to form docosatetraenoyl-CoA (DTA-CoA/Adrenic acid/7,10,13,16-docosatetraenoic acid
  (7,10,13,16-22:4(n-6)). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzymes ELOVL5 or ELOVL2.  Malanoyl-CoA
  provides the additional two carbons required for elongation. Docosatetraenoyl-CoA
  is further metabolized by cyclooxygenases (COX), lipoxygenases (LO) and cytochrome
  P450s (CYP450s) to dihomo (DH) eicosanoids (Kopf et al. 2010, Leonard et al. 2004).
