summary: 'After DNA repair synthesis is completed at transcription-coupled nucleotide
  excision repair (TC-NER) sites, transcription resumes. A number of factors have
  been implicated in this process. ERCC6 (CSB) contains an ubiquitin-binding domain
  that is indispensable for its function in TC-NER and the restoration of damage-inhibited
  RNA synthesis (Anindya et al. 2010). The ubiquitin ligase activity of the ERCC8:DDB1:CUL4:RBX1
  complex plays an important role in termination of TC-NER, possibly by targeting
  ERCC6 or its ubiquitinated partner for degradation and promoting dissociation of
  repair factors from the RNA polymerase II complex (Groisman et al. 2006, Vermeulen
  and Fousteri 2013). The ubiquitin protease complex composed of UVSSA and USP7 is
  also implicated in the recovery of RNA synthesis (RRS) (Nakazawa et al. 2012, Scwertman
  et al. 2012, Zhang et al. 2012, Fei and Chen 2012). ELL protein, recruited to the
  TFIIH complex, possibly as a component of the little elongation complex, is needed
  for RRS (Mourgues et al. 2013). Furthermore, histone chaperone FACT promotes accelerated
  histone exchange at TC-NER sites, allowing efficient progression of TC-NER and restoration
  of RNA synthesis after the repair of transcription blocking damages is completed
  (Dinant et al. 2013). '
