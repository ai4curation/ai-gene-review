display_name: v-ATPase:Ragulator:RRAGA,B:GTP:RRAGC,D:GDP:SLC38A9:Arginine dissociates
  yielding v-ATPase:Ragulator:RRAGA,B:GTP:RRAGC,D:GDP and SLC38A9:Arginine
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RRAGA:GTP (RagA:GTP) binds poorly to SLC38A9, therefore SLC39A9 is believed
  to dissociate from RRAGA:GTP after RRAGA exchanges GDP for GTP (Shen and Sabatini
  2018). In this way one molecule of SLC38A9 can enhance the exchange of GDP for GTP
  for many molecules of RRAGA (Shen and Sabatini 2018).
