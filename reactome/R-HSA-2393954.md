display_name: Mitochondrial NUDT9 hydrolyses ADP-ribose to R5P and AMP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mitochondrial NUDT9 (ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase) catalyzes the hydrolysis
  of ADP-ribose to form AMP and D-ribose 5-phosphate. The active enzyme is the longer
  of two isoforms generated by alternative splicing and is a monomer complexed with
  two magnesium ions (Perraud et al. 2003; Shen et al. 2003).
