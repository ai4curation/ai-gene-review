stable_id: R-HSA-391158
display_name: SIRP alpha binds CD47
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CD47 is an extracellular ligand for SIRP alpha. SIRP alpha directly binds
  to the loops of the Ig variable like domain of CD47 in an end-to-end fashion. The
  SIRP alpha/CD47 interaction is unusual in that it can lead to bidirectional signaling
  through SIRP alpha and CD47. The major function of this interaction is prevention
  of phagocytosis of RBC and platelets by macrophages.
