stable_id: R-HSA-9934893
display_name: Proteolysis of K48polyUb-K,p-S-PER1,2,3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The proteasome degrades K48-polyubiquitinylated, phosphorylated PER1 and,
  by inference, K48-polyubiquitinylated PER2 and PER3 (Shirogane et al. 2005). Ubiquitinylation
  and degradation of PER1 is dependent on its phosphorylation by CSNK1E (Shirogane
  et al. 2005), and, by inference, CSNK1D.
