display_name: CHST4 transfers SO4(2-) from PAPS to Core 2 mucins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 4 (CHST4) transfers sulfate (SO4(2-)) from
  the high energy donor 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) to position 6 of non-reducing
  N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues of mucin-associated glycans that ultimately
  serve as SELL ligands which are present in high endothelial cells (HEVs) and play
  a central role in lymphocyte homing at sites of inflammation.  CHST4 preferentially
  sulfates Core 2 mucins (Bistrup et al. 1999). CHST4 is localised to the Golgi membrane
  (de Graffenried & Bertozzi 2004).
