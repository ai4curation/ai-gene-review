display_name: ERBB2 homodimerization
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ERBB2, present at low levels in normal cells, is overexpressed in cancer
  cells with ERBB2 gene amplification, leading to growth factor-independent activation
  of ERBB2 signaling through formation of ERBB2 homodimers (Pickl and Ries 2009, Maadi
  et al. 2018). It is assumed that during homodimerization, similar to normal heterodimerization
  with ligand-activated ERBB family members, chaperone proteins HSP90 and CDC37, as
  well as ERBB2IP, dissociate from ERBB2 (Borg et al. 2000, Xu et al. 2001, Citri
  et al. 2004).
