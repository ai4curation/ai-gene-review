summary: 'There are three well-characterized families of opioid peptides produced
  by the body: endorphins, enkephalins and dynorphins. Endorphins are processed from
  the precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) (Takahashi H et al, 1981), which can also
  be processed to yield adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and alpha- and gamma-melanocyte
  stimulating hormone (MSH). Beta-endorphin (Dragon N et al, 1977) is a 31 amino acid
  peptide found in neurons of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. It is released
  into the blood (from the pituitary gland) and into the spinal cord and brain from
  hypothalamic neurons during vigourous exercise, excitement and orgasm. Beta-endorphin
  binds with the highest affinity to the mu-opioid receptor but it also possesses
  some affinity towards the delta- and kappa-opioid receptors. Once bound, it acts
  as an analgesic in the body by dulling pain. It does this by breaking down bradykinins
  which are peptides which accumulate in response to injury. The  mu-opioid receptor
  (MOR) (Wang JB et al, 1994) possesses high affinity for enkephalins and beta-endorphin
  but low affinity for dynorphins.<br>The enkephalins are endogenous ligands, or specifically
  endorphins, as they are internally derived and bind to the body''s opioid receptors.
  There are two forms of enkephalin, one containing leucine ("leu"), while the other
  contains methionine ("met"). The met-enkephalin peptide sequence is coded by the
  POMC gene whereas leu-enkephalin is coded by both POMC and dynorphin genes. Enkephalins
  are pentapeptides involved in regulating pain and nociception in the body. Their
  action is mediated through the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) (Knapp RJ et al, 1994).<br>Dynorphins
  constitute a class of opioid peptides that arise from the precursor protein prodynorphin.
  When prodynorphin is cleaved during processing by proprotein convertase 2 (PC2),
  multiple active peptides are released, amongst which are dynorphin A, dynorphin
  B, big-dyn and alpha/beta-neoendorphin (Day R et al, 1998). Dynorphins primarily
  exert their effects through the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR), a G-protein coupled
  receptor (Simonin F et al, 1995). Two subtypes of KORs have been identified: K1
  and K2. Although KOR is the primary receptor for all dynorphins (James IF et al,
  1982), the peptides do have some affinity for MOR and DOR.'
