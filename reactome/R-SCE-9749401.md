stable_id: R-SCE-9749401
display_name: CTD1-mediated formation of MCM2-7 double hexamers at the replication
  origins in budding yeast
species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
summary: Based on studies in budding yeast, after CDT1-mediated loading of the MCM2-7
  complex to CDC6 bound to the ORC(1-6) complex at the replication origin and ATP-dependent
  release of CDT1, another complex of CDT1 and MCM2-7 is loaded, resulting in the
  formation of the salt-stable double hexamer of MCM2-7 (Fernández-Cid et al. 2013).
  MCM2-7 double hexamers are connected head-to-head via their N-terminal rings. DNA
  runs through a central channel in the double hexamer (Remus et al. 2009).

## Summary

Based on studies in budding yeast, after CDT1-mediated loading of the MCM2-7 complex to CDC6 bound to the ORC(1-6) complex at the replication origin and ATP-dependent release of CDT1, another complex of CDT1 and MCM2-7 is loaded, resulting in the formation of the salt-stable double hexamer of MCM2-7 (Fernández-Cid et al. 2013). MCM2-7 double hexamers are connected head-to-head via their N-terminal rings. DNA runs through a central channel in the double hexamer (Remus et al. 2009).
