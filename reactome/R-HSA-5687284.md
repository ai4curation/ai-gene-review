stable_id: R-HSA-5687284
display_name: DMBT1 binds SFTPD 12mer, SFTPAs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 protein (DMBT1 aka Gp-340, Hensin, salivary
  agglutinin) is a binding protein that could play a role in mucosal innate immunity.
  It is secreted into the broncho-alveolar surface lining fluid and in saliva. DMTB1
  can bind surfactant proteins SFTPA and D in macrophage tissues, the resulting complex
  being able to interact with and agglutinate several Gram-negative and Gram-positive
  bacteria (Holmskov et al. 1999, Ligtenberg et al. 2001; reviews - Lightenberg et
  al. 2007, Madsen et al. 2010). DMBT1 has been proposed as a tumor suppressor gene
  candidate in human brain tumors. Two mutations, one of which resulted in an amino
  acid change (Q420H), occurred in glioblastomas (Mueller et al. 2002).
