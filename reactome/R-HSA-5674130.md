stable_id: R-HSA-5674130
display_name: MAP2Ks and MAPKs are phosphorylated at the endosome membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interaction of MAPK pathway components with LAMTOR2, 3 and MORG1 facilitates
  pathway activation in response to varied stimuli, resulting in the phosphorylation
  of MAP2K and MAPK proteins at conserved sites in their activation loops (Schaeffer
  et al, 1998; Teis et al, 2002; Teis et al, 2006; Vomastek et al, 2004; Sharma et
  al, 2005; reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011).
