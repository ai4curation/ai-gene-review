display_name: MTREX (MTR4, SKIV2L2) in PAXT:RBM26:RBM27:ZC3H3:YTHDC1:YTHDC2:CBCA:polyadenylated
  m7GpppN-RNA:PABPN1 binds the RNA exosome
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The EXOSC10 (RRP6, PM/Scl-100) subunit of the RNA exosome associates with
  the MTREX (MTR4, SKIV2L2) subunit of the PAXT connection (Schilders et al. 2007,
  Meola et al. 2016, Silla et al. 2020), which initiates the degradation of the PAXT-associated
  RNA (Fan et al. 2024). The interactions of the PAXT complex and the NEXT complex
  with the RNA exosome are mutually exclusive (Meola et al. 2016). The NEXT complex
  targets nascent unpolyadenylated RNAs while the PAXT connection targets more mature
  polyadenylated RNAs (Meola et al. 2016, Wu et al. 2020).
