## Summary

Tyrosine phosphorylation at residue 705 is required for STAT3 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding while the function of serine 727 phosphorylation remains largely unknown. The mechanism for serine phosphorylation is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation (reviewed in Yu et al, 2014; Guanizo et al, 2018).
