species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Interleukin-27 is a heterodimer composed of Interleukin-27 subunit alpha
  (IL27) and Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3). It binds to the Interleukin-27
  heterodimeric receptor, which is composed of Interleukin-27 receptor subunit alpha
  (IL27RA, WSX-1) and Interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta (IL6ST, gp130). IL6ST is
  a signal transducing protein that is a component of several other cytokine receptors
  including the Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-11 receptors (Pflanz et al. 2004). In
  the absence of IL27RA, Interleukin-27 can bind to IL6ST but with low affinity (Jia
  et al. 2016).<br>Regulation: IL27RA can be cleaved releasing a soluble form (sIL27RA)
  that can bind to Interleukin-27 and antagonize Interleukin-27  binding to its heterodimer
  receptor (Dietrich et al. 2014).'
