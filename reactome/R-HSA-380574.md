summary: 'Dopamine loaded synaptic vesicles are docked, inside the synapse in the

## Summary

Dopamine loaded synaptic vesicles are docked, inside the synapse in the presynaptic cell, close to the plasma membrane. The docking brings the vesicles in close proximity to the release site to facilitate the release of dopamine.
