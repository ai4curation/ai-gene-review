display_name: ASICs bind STOML3, (STOM)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Stomatin (STOM) and Stomatin-like protein 3 (STOML3) are accessory proteins
  for the ASIC channels (Zeng et al. 2014). STOML3 and stomatin are expressed by primary
  sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (Mannsfeldt et al. 1999, Wetzel
  et al. 2007) and regulate mechanoreceptor sensitivity in mice (Wetzel et al. 2007,
  Martinez-Saldago et al. 2007). STOML3 and to a lesser extent STOM can modulate the
  gating of ASICs (Price et al. 2004, Wetzel et al. 2007). STOML3 can bind ASIC1a,
  1b, 2a, 2b, 3 and 4 (Lapatsina et al. 2012) . The function of STOML3 may be to prime
  the transduction complex for insertion into the plasma membrane (Lapatsina et al.
  2012). Alternatively, STOML3 may control membrane mechanics by binding cholesterol
  to tune the sensitivity of mechano-gated channels(Qi et al. 2015).
