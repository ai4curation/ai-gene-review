stable_id: R-HSA-203567
display_name: Palmitoylation of eNOS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ZDHHC21, associated with the Golgi membrane, palmitoylates cytosolic eNOS
  (Nitric oxide synthase 3), enabling its localization to plasmalemmal caveolae (Garcia-Cardena
  et al. 1996; Shaul et al. 1996). Localization to this microdomain is likely to optimize
  eNOS activation and the extracellular release of nitric oxide. ZDHHC21 belongs to
  a family of DHHC domain-containing cysteine-rich proteins, several of which can
  mediate eNOS palmitoylation in cultured human endothelial cells. Only inhibition
  of ZDHHC21 palmitoyl transferase reduces eNOS palmitoylation, eNOS targeting, and
  stimulated NO production (Fernández-Hernando et al. 2006), so only ZDHHC21 activity
  is annotated here.
