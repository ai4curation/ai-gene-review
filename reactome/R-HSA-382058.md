stable_id: R-HSA-382058
display_name: Nck binds to the active PDGF receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Nck is a widely expressed protein consisting exclusively of SH2 and SH3 domains.
  With its SH2 doamin Nck interacts with Tyr571 of the PDGF beta-receptor and it also
  interacts with the alpha-receptor, but the sites of interaction have not been determined.
  Nck is involved in the activation of the JNK serine/threonine kinase through interaction
  with the serine/threonine kinases PAK1 and NIK.
