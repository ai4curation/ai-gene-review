summary: 'Proteomic studies suggest that the cilium is home to approximately a thousand
  proteins, and has a unique protein and lipid make up relative to the bulk cytoplasm
  and plasma membrane (Pazour et al, 2005; Ishikawa et al, 2012; Ostrowoski et al,
  2002; reviewed in Emmer et al, 2010; Rohatgi and Snell, 2010). In addition, the
  cilium is a dynamic structure, and the axoneme is continually being remodeled by
  addition and removal of tubulin at the distal tip (Marshall and Rosenbaum, 2001;
  Stephens, 1997; Song et al, 2001). As a result, the function and structure of this
  organelle relies on the directed trafficking of protein and vesicles to the cilium.
  Small GTPases of the RAS, RAB, ARF and ARL families are involved in cytoskeletal
  organization and membrane traffic and are required to regulate the traffic from
  the Golgi and the trans-Golgi network to the cilium (reviewed in Deretic, 2013;
  Li et al, 2012). ARF4 is a Golgi-resident GTPase that acts in conjunction with a
  ciliary-targeting complex consisting of the ARF-GAP ASAP1, RAB11A, the RAB11 effector
  FIP3 and the RAB8A guanine nucleotide exchange factor RAB3IP/RABIN8 to target cargo
  bearing a putative C-terminal VxPx targeting motif to the cilium. A well-studied
  example of this system involves the trafficking of rhodopsin to the retinal rod
  photoreceptors, a specialized form of the cilium (reviewed in Deretic, 2013). ARL3,
  ARL13B and ARL6 are all small ARF-like GTPases with assorted roles in ciliary trafficking
  and maintenance. Studies in C. elegans suggest that ARL3 and ARL13B have opposing
  roles in maintaining the stability of the anterograde IFT trains in the cilium (Li
  et al, 2010). In addition, both ARL3 and ARL13B have roles in facilitating the traffic
  of subsets of ciliary cargo to the cilium. Myristoylated cargo such as peripheral
  membrane protein Nephrocystin-3 (NPHP3) is targeted to the cilium in a UNC119- and
  ARL3-dependent manner, while ARL13B is required for the PDE6-dependent ciliary localization
  of INPP5E (Wright et al, 2011; Humbert et al, 2012; reviewed in Li et al, 2012).
  ARL6 was also identified as BBS3, a gene that when mutated gives rise to the ciliopathy
  Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). ARL6 acts upstream of a complex of 8 other BBS-associated
  proteins known as the BBSome. ARL6 and the BBSome are required for the ciliary targeting
  of proteins including the melanin concentrating hormone receptor (MCHR) and the
  somatostatin receptor (SSTR3), among others (Nachury et al, 2007; Loktev et al,
  2008; Jin et al, 2010; Zhang et al, 2011). Both the BBSome and ARL6 may continue
  to be associated with cargo inside the cilium, as they are observed to undergo typical
  IFT movements along the axoneme (Fan et al, 2004; Lechtreck et al, 2009; reviewed
  in Li et al, 2012).  '

## Summary

Proteomic studies suggest that the cilium is home to approximately a thousand proteins, and has a unique protein and lipid make up relative to the bulk cytoplasm and plasma membrane (Pazour et al, 2005; Ishikawa et al, 2012; Ostrowoski et al, 2002; reviewed in Emmer et al, 2010; Rohatgi and Snell, 2010).
