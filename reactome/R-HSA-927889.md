stable_id: R-HSA-927889
display_name: SMG1 phosphorylates UPF1 (enhanced by Exon Junction Complex)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SMG1 phosphorylates UPF1 in vitro and in vivo (Denning et al. 2001, Yamashita
  et al. 2001, Kashima et al. 2006). Serines 1073, 1078, 1096, and 1116 in isoform
  2 (Serines 1084, 1089, 1107, 1127 in isoform 1) are phosphorylated in vitro  and
  phosphorylation at serines 1078 and 1096 has been confirmed in vivo (Yamashita et
  al. 2001, Ohnishi et al. 2003, Kashima et al. 2006). UPF1 also contains additional
  serine and threonine residues that could be phosphorylated. SMG8 and SMG9 associate
  with SMG1 and regulate the kinase activity of SMG1 (Yamashita et al. 2009). The
  phosphorylation reaction is rate-limiting in nonsense-mediated decay and is therefore
  regarded as a licensing step (reviewed in Rebbapragada and Lykke-Andersen 2009).
  Phosphorylation is enhanced by the exon junction complex, which can interact with
  UPF1 via UPF2 and/or UPF3 (Kashima et al. 2006, Ivanov et al. 2008) or via Y14:Magoh
  (Ivanov et al. 2008). SMG8 and SMG9 bind SMG1 and regulate its kinase activity (Yamashita
  et al. 2009, Fernandez et al. 2011).
