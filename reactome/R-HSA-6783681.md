display_name: LIF binds LIFR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), initially named for its ability to cause
  myeloid leukemic cells to differentiate into macrophages (Gearing et al. 1987) is
  a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-related cytokines. It possesses overlapping
  function with other IL-6 family members. The pleiotrophic effects of LIF in many
  physiological systems include proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival
  (Hilton 1992, Metcalf 1992). It exerts numerous effects in the nervous system, promote
  gliogenesis, support neural stem cell (NSC) renewal (Bonni et al. 1997, Hermanson
  et al. 2002, Pitman et al. 2004) and also been implicated in the expression of various
  cytokines. LIF exerts its effects by binding to a bipartite membrane receptor complex
  that consists of the LIF receptor subunit (LIFR) and the glycoprotein (gp)130 subunit
  and activates STAT3. LIF initially binds LIFR and the LIFR Ig-like domains contributes
  to LIF binding (Bitard et al. 2003).

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), initially named for its ability to cause myeloid leukemic cells to differentiate into macrophages (Gearing et al. 1987) is a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-related cytokines.
