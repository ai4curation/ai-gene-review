stable_id: R-HSA-9681616
display_name: AP2 binds chlorpromazine
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The human adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2) is involved in clathrin-dependent
  endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by
  clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the
  early endosome. Chlorpromazine was the first antipsychotic drug developed for the
  treatment of schizophrenia. Chlorpromazine is a cationic amphiphilic drug that disrupts
  clathrin-mediated endocytosis by inhibiting the relocation of clathrin and AP2 from
  the cell surface (Inoue et al. 2007, Yao et al. 2002). Chlorpromazine may also inhibit
  the replication of MERS and SARS viruses.
