display_name: BACE1 cleaves APP(18-770) to APP(18-671) and APP(672-770)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Amyloid precursor protein (APP(18-770)) is processed by one of two distinct
  proteolytic pathways; the non-amyloidogenic pathway where alpha-secretase cleaves
  APP at the cell surface within the A-beta domain, liberating APPs-alpha and the
  amyloidogenic pathway, where beta-secretase followed by gamma-secretase cleavages
  results in peptides which are the main fibril-forming peptides implicated in Alzheimer's
  disease. In the first step of the amyloidogenic pathway, the endosomal membrane
  protein beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) catalyses the cleavage of APP(18-770) within the
  ectodomain and liberates a soluble proteolytic fragment, termed soluble APP-beta
  (APPs-beta, APP(18-671)) and C99 (APP(672-770) (Baranello et al. 2015, Andrew et
  al. 2016). APP processing can occur in several endocytic and secretory pathways.
  For simplicity, the endosome has been chosen in this event.
