display_name: Recruitment Of HIV Virion Budding Machinery
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The human ESCRT pathway comprises more than 30 different proteins, and this
  complexity is expanded further by associated regulatory and ubiquitylation machinery.
  Functional studies have identified a minimal core set of human ESCRT proteins, machinery
  that is essential for HIV-1 budding. ESCRT-1 recruitment follows an unusal path.
  The PTAP motif in p6 mimics the ESCRT-1 recruitment motif, bypassing the need for
  ESCRT-0. The TSG101/ ESCRT-I and ALIX both function by recruiting downstream ESCRT-III
  and VPS4 complexes, which in turn mediate membrane fission and ESCRT factor recycling.
