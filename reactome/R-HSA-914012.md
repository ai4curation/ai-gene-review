display_name: GCNTs transfer GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to Core 1 mucins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The human gene GCNT encodes beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase which
  mediates core 2 O-glycan branching by the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine, an
  important step in mucin-type biosynthesis. There are 3 defined members in humans,
  1, 3 and 4 (Bierhuizen and Fukuda, 1992; Yeh et al, 1999; Schwientek et al, 2000).
  Two members (6 and 7) may be part of the family based on sequence similarity. '
