display_name: NOSIP mediated eNOS trafficking
species: Homo sapiens
summary: eNOS-interacting protein (NOSIP) is a 34-kDa nucleocytoplasmic shuttling
  protein that binds to the COOH-terminal region (amino acids 366-486) of the eNOS
  oxygenase domain.  This protein association promotes translocation of eNOS from
  the plasma membrane caveolae to the cytoskeleton and inhibits eNOS activity.  Studies
  have found that NOSIP accumulates in the cytoplasm specifically during the G2 phase
  of the cell cycle.
