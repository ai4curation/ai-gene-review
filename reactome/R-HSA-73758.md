display_name: Recruitment of Active RNA Polymerase I to SL1:phos.UBF-1:rDNA Promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Composed of Acetylated SL1, phosphorylated UBF-1 bound the rDNA promoter
  as well as the active RNA polymerase holoenzyme, rrn3 and TFIIH the transcription
  initiation complex is complete. The assembly picture is incomplete, as the point
  at which TFIIH joins the complex is unknown, though by the time that this complex
  is formed TFIIH is present (it has been included at this step for completeness).
  This forms the transcriptionally active enzyme, that is capable of initiating transcription
  from the rDNA promoter.
