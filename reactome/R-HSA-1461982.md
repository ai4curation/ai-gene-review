display_name: Alpha-defensin dimers multimerize to form a pore complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once adsorbed/inserted into the membrane, alpha defensins are believed to
  aggregate into pore forming structures. Based on vesicle leakage and dextran permeability
  experiments, Wimley et al. (1994)  proposed a multimeric pore model consisting of
  6-8 defensin dimers which come together to form a large pore with inner diameter
  of 2-2.5nm. More recently using solid-state NMR and artificial lipid bilayers, Zhang
  et al. (2010) provide evidence of a dimer pore model in which the polar top of the
  dimer lines an aqueous pore while the hydrophobic bottom faces the lipid chains.
  Regardless of the exact conformation, the resulting pores then allow the efflux
  of essential microbial cell components.
