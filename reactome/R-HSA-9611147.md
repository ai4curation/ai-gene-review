summary: Once the  pentameric viral protein complex, gH:gL:p128:p130:p131A, facilitates
  attchment of the Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) endocytic uptake allows the virion
  to enter epithelial and endothelial cells. The virion is released from the endocytic
  vesicle by low-pH-dependent fusion of the virion coat with endosomes membrane.
