display_name: ATG16L1 complex transfers LC3 from ATG3 to PE
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ATG16L1 complex (consisting of ATG12, ATG5 and ATG16L1)  functions as
  an E3-like ligase, mediating the transfer of LC3 ubiquitin-like proteins from the
  E2-like enzyme ATG3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the expanding membrane (Tanida
  et al. 2002, Hanada et al. 2007, Fujita et al. 2008, Sakoh-Nakatogawa et al. 2013).
  In this final step of LC3 lipidation, the C-terminal glycine of the LC3 protein
  is conjugated to PE through an amide bond (Ichimura et al. 2000). This results in
  the lipidation of LC3 proteins at the curved membrane forming the autophagosome
  (Carlsson & Simonsen 2015). The resulting lipid-conjugated LC3 proteins are sometimes
  referred to as LC3-II. In yeast the LC3 family is represented by one protein, Atg8,
  which has a C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain that is preceded by a short N-terminal
  extension. The human LC3 family has six members (Slobodkin & Elazar 2013). The microtubule-associated
  protein-1 light chain proteins MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B and MAP1LC3C typically have their
  names shortened respectively to LC3A, LC3B and LC3C. The remaining family members
  are the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-receptor-associated proteins GABARAP, GABARAPL1
  and GABARAPL2. The biological relevance of this expansion of Atg8 proteins in higher
  eukaryotes is largely unknown (Slobodkin & Elazar 2013, Wild et al. 2014).<br><br>ATG3
