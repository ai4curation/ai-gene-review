display_name: MTORC1 dissociates from ULK complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: When cellular energy is depleted mTORC1 dissociates from the ULK1 complex
  (Hosakawa et al. 2009, Lee et al. 2010, Wong et al. 2013). The phosphorylation of
  RPTOR (Raptor) by AMPK promotes the dissociation of mTORC1 from the ULK1 complex,
  which leads to a reduction in S758 phosphorylation on ULK1 (Shang et al. 2011).
  The S758-unphosphorylated ULK1 is able to associate with, and be activated by, AMPK
  (Egan et al. 2011).
