display_name: ub-hydroxyPro-HIF-alpha:VHL:EloB,C:CUL2:RBX1 translocates from the nucleus
  to the cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: When hypoxic cells return to normoxia, HIF-alpha is ubiquitinated in the
  nucleus and exported to the cytosol (Groulx and Lee 2002). The shuttling of VHL
  between the nucleus and cytosol is required (Groulx and Lee 2002, Lee et al. 1999).
  Different cell types have different nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization of HIF
  degradation (Zheng et al. 2006).
