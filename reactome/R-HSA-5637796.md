display_name: Phosphorylation of SHC1 by p-5Y-EGFRvIII
species: Homo sapiens
summary: EGFRvIII cancer mutant was not directly tested for its ability to phosphorylate
  SHC1, but is assumed to interact with SHC1 in the same way as the wild-type EGFR
  protein (Soler et al. 1994, VanderKuur et al. 1995).
