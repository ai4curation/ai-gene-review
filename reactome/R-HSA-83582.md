display_name: TRADD:TRAF2:RIP1 dissociates from TNF-α:TNFR1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once formed in context of the TNFR1 signaling complex the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1
  complex may dissociate from the TNF:TNFR1 platform. With the recruitment of FADD
  and caspase-8 to the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1 complex the cell is pushed along the apoptotic
  pathway provided that the protective FLIP protein and TRAF2-associated BIRC (cIAPs)
  do not inhibit caspase-8 activation by RIPK1 and RIPK3-mediated activation of the
  necroptotic pathway.
