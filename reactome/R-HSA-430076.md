stable_id: R-HSA-430076
display_name: GP1b-IX-V binds 14-3-3-zeta
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Gp1b-IX-V complex binds to 14-3-3-zeta, a scaffolding protein. The highly
  conserved cytoplasmic domain of GpIb alpha binds directly to dimeric 14-3-3 zeta
  adapter protein. Binding also involves regions of GpV, and is enhanced by phosphorylation
  of GP1b at Ser-609 or Ser-166 of Gp1b alpha and beta respectively. For Gp1b beta
  this phosphorylation is PKA-dependent.
