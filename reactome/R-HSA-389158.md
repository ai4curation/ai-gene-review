stable_id: R-HSA-389158
display_name: CD28 bound PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon binding to CD28, the PI3K enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3).
  This conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 is significant as PIP3 acts as a docking site on
  the plasma membrane for several downstream signaling molecules, including 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase-1 (PDK1) and protein kinase B (PKB or Akt), which are essential for T cell
  proliferation, survival, and activation (Pages et al. 1994, Appleman et al. 2002).
