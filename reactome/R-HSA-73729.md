species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Human SL1 is a four subunit complex composed of the TATA-binding protein
  (TBP) and three TBP-associated factors (TAFs): TAF(1)110, TAF(1)63, and TAF(1)48.
  Note that none of these three TAFs for Pol I show any homology to the Pol II or
  Pol III TAFs. TAFs SL1 is a species specific factor.'
