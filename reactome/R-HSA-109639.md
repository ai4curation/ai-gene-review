summary: The binding of TFIIH completes the assembly of the preinitiation complex
  (PIC) for RNA Polymerase II transcription.  Although RNA polymerase binds the TATA
  box on the promoter DNA, no initiation of transcription occurs until TFIIH is bound
  to the PIC.  TFIIH is the only factor with known enzymatic activities.
