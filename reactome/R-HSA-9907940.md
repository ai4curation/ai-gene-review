display_name: Formation of the preholothymoproteasome
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The 20S thymoproteasome core particle (20S tCP) can be isolated from human
  immune system-derived cell lines already expressing PSMB9 (beta-1i) and PSMB10 (beta-2i),
  which replace the constitutive PSMB6 (beta-1) and PSBM7 (beta-2), respectively,
  that were engineered to overexpress PSMB11 (beta-5t) (Kuckelkorn et al. 2019).
