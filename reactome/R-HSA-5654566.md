species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'FRS2 has 8 canonical MAPK phosphorylation sites which are phosphorylated
  by activated ERK1/2 after FGF stimulation.  Phosphorylation of these 8 threonine
  residues counteracts the activating effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2,
  although the exact mechanism for this negative regulation is not known.  Expression
  of a version of FRS2 in which the 8 threonine residues are mutated to valine results
  in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2, enhanced GRB2-SOS1 recruitment and
  a more sustained MAPK response. The 8 threonine residues are not conserved in FRS3;
  as a result, signaling through FRS3 complexes do not appear to be subject to this
  downregulation. '
