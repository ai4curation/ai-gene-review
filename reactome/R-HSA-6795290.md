stable_id: R-HSA-6795290
display_name: TORC2 complex phosphorylates SGK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The TORC2 complex phosphorylates SGK1 at serine residue S422, located in
  the carboxy-terminal hydrophobic motif of SGK1. Phosphorylation at S422 contributes
  to SGK1 activation (Garcia-Martinez and Alessi 2008, Lu et al. 2010).
