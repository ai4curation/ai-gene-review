display_name: Transport of MHC heterotrimer to ER exit site
species: Homo sapiens
summary: When the loaded peptide is of a sufficiently high-affinity the trimeric complex
  is transported to a special ER exit site by a putative cargo receptor, B cell receptor-associated
  protein (BAP31), where it translocates to the cell surface, possibly by transport
  in COPII-coated vesicles.
