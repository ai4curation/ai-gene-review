summary: Amplification of full length FGFR2 is only weakly transforming in NIH 3T3

  transformation potential (Cha, 2008; Cha, 2009).  These variants lack a number of
  carboxy-terminal tyrosine residues, including Y770 and Y773.  Loss of Y770 contributes
  to transformation by enhancing FRS2 binding to the C-terminally truncated variant.  This
  suggests that in the context of the full-length protein the presence of Y770 restricts
  access of FRS2 to the receptor.  Loss or mutation of Y773 impairs internalization
  and degradation of the receptor and promotes sustained signaling (Cha, 2009).   Gastric
