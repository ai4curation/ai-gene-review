display_name: Translocation of Cyclin B1:phospho-Cdc2 complexes to the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: During interphase, cyclin B1:Cdc2 shuttles continuously in and out of the
  nucleus. Cyclin B1:Cdc2 is transported into the nucleus by an unusual mechanism
  that requires importin b but not importin a or Ran.  Dissociation of  the cyclin-B1:Cdc2:importin
  complex in the nucleus requires ATP and involves other yet  unidentified  nuclear
  factors  (Takizawa et al.,1999).
