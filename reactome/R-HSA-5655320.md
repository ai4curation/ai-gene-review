species: Homo sapiens
summary: FGFR1-amplified cells derived from lung cancer patients show phosphorylation
  of AKT and S6, demonstrating the activation of the PI3K signaling pathway in these
  lines.  Inhibition of FGFR1 phosphorylation by treatment with the in vitro reagent
  PD173074 did not abrogate the phosphorylation of these substrates, however, indicating
  that the PI3K pathway is not the major signaling pathway activated by amplified
  FGFR1 (Weiss, 2010; Dutt, 2011).  Activation of the PI3K pathway has also been demonstrated
  downstream of other FGFR mutants (see for instance, Agazie, 2003; Kunii, 2008, Takeda,
  2007; Byron, 2008; Demiroglu, 2001; Guasch, 2001; Chen, 2004); however not all mutants
  activate the PI3K pathway to the same extent and in the case of the rhabdomyosarcoma
  FGFR4 mutants K535 and E550, phosphorylation of AKT is actually reduced compared
  to wild-type signaling (Taylor, 2009).
