display_name: Transphosphorylation of JAK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The initial phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 is mediated by JAK2. Autophosphorylated
  JAK2 may transphopshorylate JAK1 bound to IFNGR1 chain. Tyrosine 1033 in the activation
  loop of the JAK1 kinase domain may be the target for transphosphorylation (phosphorylation
  site mentioned here is based on sequence similarity with all the other JAK kinases).
