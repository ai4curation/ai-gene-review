display_name: SRC-1 is activated (in F2R:ARRB1:MAPKs:SRC-1)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The activity of Src-kinase is increased when bound to Beta-arrestin-1. The
  mechanism for this activation is not clear. Src bound to beta -arrestin 1 is substantially
  dephosphorylated at Tyr530 and this is often associated with Src activation. Binding
  results with Y530F mutants of Src suggest that binding of Src to arrestin causes
  a conformational activation of the kinase, rather than a change in phosphorylation.
  However, increased phosphorylation of Src Tyr419 in cells overexpressing beta-arrestin-1
  has been reported to correlate with PAR1 activation, beta-arrestin signalling complex
  formation, and increased ERK activation.
