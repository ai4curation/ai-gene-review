display_name: Phosphorylation of MDM4 by CHEK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CHEK2 (Chk2) kinase is required for phosphorylation of MDM4 at serine residues
  S342 and S367 in vivo. CHEK2-mediated phosphorylation stimulates MDM4 ubiquitination
  by MDM2 and subsequent degradation (Chen et al. 2005).

## Summary

CHEK2 (Chk2) kinase is required for phosphorylation of MDM4 at serine residues S342 and S367 in vivo. CHEK2-mediated phosphorylation stimulates MDM4 ubiquitination by MDM2 and subsequent degradation (Chen et al. 2005).
