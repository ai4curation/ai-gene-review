stable_id: R-HSA-9618392
display_name: miR-26 binds to the 3'UTR of the ARL4C mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A small non-coding RNA miR-26 was identified as a liver X receptor (LXR or
  NR1H2,3)-responsive miRNA that is downregulated in the presence of LXR agonist T0901317
  (Sun D et al. 2012). miR-26 suppressed the translation of ADP-ribosylation factor-like
  4C (ARL4C or ARL7) mRNA in NR1H2,3 (LXR)‐activated human (THP-1) and mouse (RAW264.7)
  macrophages. Bioinformatic tools for miRNA target prediction showed that the seed
  regions of miR‐26a and miR‐26b were complementary to the ARL4C 3′UTR (Sun D et al.
  2012). The miR-26 binding sites in ARL4C 3′UTR were highly conserved among mammals
  (Sun D et al. 2012). Further, 3'UTR luciferase reporter assay using human embryonic
  kidney cells (HEK293T) showed that a miR-26 mimetic inhibits ARL4C 3′UTR luciferase
  reporter activity and this is absent with the mutant ARL4C 3′UTR firefly luciferase
  reporter (Sun D et al. 2012). Similar results were obtained for another NR1H2,3-regulated
  gene ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). Moreover, miR‐26 was shown to
  suppress the NR1H2,3‐dependent cholesterol efflux in RAW264.7 cells by targeting
  ARL4C and ABCA1 (Sun D et al. 2012). This Reactome event describes the miR-26-regulated
  translation of ARL4C mRNA in responce to NR1H2,3 ligands. The annotation is based
  on the study with GW3965 and T0901317, the synthetic agonists of NR1H2,3 (Sun D
  et al. 2012).
