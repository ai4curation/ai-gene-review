stable_id: R-HSA-508247
display_name: Gab2 binds the p85 subunit of Class 1A PI3 kinases
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Shc promotes Gab2 tyrosine phosphorylation via Grb2 (Gu et al. 2000). This
  promotes binding of Gab2 to p85alpha, a component of Class 1A PI3Ks (Gu et al. 1998).
  JAK1 may also be involved in PI3K recruitment (Migone et al. 1998). Binding of p85
  activates PI3K kinase activity, with consequent effects on many processes including
  Akt activation. This is one of two mechanisms described for the recruitment of PI3K
  to the IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptors, the other is mediated by Serine-585 phosphorylation
  of the common beta chain.
