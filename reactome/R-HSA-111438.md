stable_id: R-HSA-111438
display_name: Recruitment of U7 snRNP:ZFP100 complex to the Histone Pre-mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The U7 snRNP.  This particle contains the U7 snRNA, the smallest of the snRNAs
  which varies from 57-70 nts long depending on the species. The 5’ end of U7 snRNA
  binds to a sequence 3’ of the stemloop, termed the histone downstream element (HDE).
  There are a number of proteins found in the U7 snRNP.  There are 7 Sm proteins,
  as are present in the spliceosomal snRNP. Five of these proteins are the same as
  ones found in the spliceosomal snRNPs and there are 2, Lsm10 and Lsm11 that are
  unique to U7 snRNP.
