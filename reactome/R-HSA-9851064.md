display_name: AcK685-pY705,S727 STAT3 dimer binds DNMT1 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT3 binds to the promoter of DNMT1 to stimulate gene expression as assessed
  by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay
  (EMSA) (Zhang et al, 2006; Ambrogio et al, 2009). In the context of NPM1-ALK signaling
  in anaplastic large cell leukemia (ALCL), STAT3 signaling also regulates DNMT1 activity
  by downregulating expression of miR-21, a microRNA that represses translation on
  DNMT1 mRNA (Zhang et al, 2011).
