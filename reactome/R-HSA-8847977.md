species: Homo sapiens
summary: FRK tyrosine kinase (RAK) phosphorylates PTEN on tyrosine residue Y336. FRK-mediated
  phosphorylation inhibits NEDD4-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation
  of PTEN, thus increasing PTEN half-life. FRK-mediated phosphorylation also increases
  PTEN enzymatic activity (Yim et al. 2009).
