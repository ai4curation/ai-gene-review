summary: 'Downstream of oncogenic RAS, a number of pathways are activated in a cancer-
  and tissue-specific manner. Common effectors include the PI3K/AKT pathway, the RAL
  GDS pathway and the canonical RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (reviewed in Prior et al, 2012;
  Pylayeva-Gupta et al, 2011; Stephen et al, 2014). Activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK
  pathway depends on the recruitment and activation of RAF downstream of oncogenic
  RAS, although the extent of pathway activation and the importance of the different
  RAF genes varies among cancer types. For instance, RAF1 (also known as CRAF) is
  necessary for onset of RAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, but is
  dispensable in RAS-driven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Dumaz et al, 2006; Heidorn
  et al, 2010; Blasco et al, 2011; Karreth et al, 2011; Eser et al, 2013). And although
  BRAF activity is not required in RAS-driven melanoma as assessed by siRNA knockdown,
  in the presence of BRAF inhibitors, BRAF paradoxically contributes to pathway activation
  through dimerization-dependent activation of RAF1 (Dumaz et al, 2006; Heidorn et
  al, 2010; Poulikakos et al, 2010; Hatzivassiliou et al, 2010; reviewed in Dumaz,
  2011; Lito et al, 2013).  '
