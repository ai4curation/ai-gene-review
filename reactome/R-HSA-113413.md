stable_id: R-HSA-113413
display_name: TFIIS-mediated recovery of elongation from arrest
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TFIIS reactivates arrested RNA Pol II directly interacting with the enzyme
  resulting in endonucleolytic excision of nascent transcript ~7-14 nucleotides upstream
  of the 3' end. This reaction is catalyzed by the catalytic site and results in the
  generation of a new 3'-OH terminus that could be used for re-extension from the
  correctly base paired site (reviewed by Shilatifard et al., 2003).

## Summary

This reaction is catalyzed by the catalytic site and results in the generation of a new 3'-OH terminus that could be used for re-extension from the correctly base paired site (reviewed by Shilatifard et al., 2003).
