species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The immunoproteasome 20S core particle (20S iCP), like the canonical 20S
  CP, consists of four axially stacked heteroheptameric rings - two inner rings and
  two outer rings (Santos et al. 2017: cryogenic electron microscopy structure of
  human 20S iCP; reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). In the 20S iCP, the inner
  ring subunits with proteolytic activity, PSMB6 (beta-1), PSMB7 (beta-2), and PSMB5
  (beta-5), are substituted with PSMB9 (beta-1i), PSMB10 (beta-2i), and PSMB8 (beta-5i),
  respectively (Santos et al. 2017: cryogenic electron microscopy structure of human
  20S iCP; reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). The immunoproteasome generates
  substrate cleavage patterns that enhance loading of peptides onto the class I major
  histocompatibility complex for immune presentation to killer T cells (reviewed in
  Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013).'

## Summary

The immunoproteasome 20S core particle (20S iCP), like the canonical 20S CP, consists of four axially stacked heteroheptameric rings - two inner rings and two outer rings (Santos et al. 2017: cryogenic electron microscopy structure of human 20S iCP; reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). In the 20S iCP, the inner ring subunits with proteolytic activity, PSMB6 (beta-1), PSMB7 (beta-2), and PSMB5 (beta-5), are substituted with PSMB9 (beta-1i), PSMB10 (beta-2i), and PSMB8 (beta-5i), respectively (Santos et al. 2017: cryogenic electron microscopy structure of human 20S iCP; reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013).
