stable_id: R-HSA-389354
display_name: Activation of Vav1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Vav1 exists in an auto-inhibitory state folded in such a way as to inhibit
  the GEF activity of its DH domain. This folding is mediated through binding of tyrosines
  in the acidic domain to the DH domain and through binding of the CH domain to the
  C1 region. Activation of Vav may involve at least three different events to relieve
  this auto-inhibition. Phosphorylation of the tyrosines causes them to be displaced
  from the DH domain, binding of a ligand to the CH domain may cause it to release
  the C1 domain and PIP3 may bind to the PH domain, altering its conformation. Vav1
  is phosphorylated on at least three tyrosines (Y142, Y160 and Y174) in the acidic
  domain, and this phosphorylation results in an increase in GEF activity. Fyn tyrosine
  kinase phosphorylates Vav1 after CD28 ligation.
