display_name: Phosphorylation of RAF1 mutants
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAF1 mutants in cancer and germline disorders such as Noonan syndrome undergo
  enhanced dimerization and activation with BRAF, leading to high levels of downstream
  signaling. This has been observed even in cases of RAF1 mutations with abrogated
  or impaired kinase activity (Razzaque et al, 2007; Pandit et al, 2007; Kobayashi
  et al, 2010; Wu et al, 2012; Krauthammer et al, 2015; reviewed in Rauen, 2013).
