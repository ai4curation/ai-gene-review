display_name: FYN phosphorylates DAB1 in RELN:VLDLR:DAB1:SH3KBP1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: One of the three domains in disabled homolog 1 (DAB1) is a tyrosine-rich
  region consists of five highly conserved tyrosine residues; Y185, Y198, Y200, Y220
  and Y232. These residues correspond to two consensus Src family kinase recognition
  sites (YQxI, Y185 and Y198) and two consensus Abl/Crk recognition sites (YxVP, Y220
  and Y232). At least three of the tyrosine residues (Y198, Y220 and Y232) can be
  phosphorylated by the Src kinase family member, tyrosine protein kinase fyn (FYN)
  in response to Reelin (RELN) stimulation (Katyal et al. 2007). Tyrosine-phosphorylated
  DAB1 acts as a hub to recruit different Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins,
  including the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), cellular
  adaptors CrkL, Crk, Nck-beta and SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) (Gao &
  Godbout 2013). Tyrosine phosphorylation of DAB1 also appears to strengthen the association
  of DAB1 with SH3KBP1 (aka CIN85), an adaptor protein involved in endocytic down-regulation
  of receptor-tyrosine kinases (Fuchigami et al. 2013).
