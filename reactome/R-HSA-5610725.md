display_name: TULP3 is required for GPR161 localization in the cilium
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TULP3 and the retrograde complex IFT-A are required to recruit GPR161 to
  the cilium in the absence of Hh ligand (Mukhopadhyay et al, 2010; Mukhopadhyay et
  al, 2013; reviewed in Mukhopadhyay and Rohtagi, 2014).  TULP3 is a negative regulator
  of Hh signaling and siRNA depletion of TULP3 reduces the ciliary accumulation of
  GPR161 (Norman et al, 2009; Patterson et al, 2009; Mukhopadhyay et al, 2010; Mukhopadhyay
  et al, 2013).
