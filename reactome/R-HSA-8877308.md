display_name: MADD exchanges GTP for GDP on RAB27
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Vertebrate RAB27 exists in two isoforms, RAB27A and RAB27B, with overlapping
  but distinct functions in trafficking to melanosomes, secretory granules and platelets
  (Kondo et al, 2006; Figueiredo et al, 2008; Tarafder et al, 2011; reviewed in Fukuda
  et al, 2013). Studies in nematodes and vertebrates have identified MADD as a RAB27
  GEF required for its activity (Mahoney et al, 2006; Tarafder et al, 2011; Yoshimura
  et al, 2010). Interaction of RAB27:GDP with its GEFs promotes release of GDP, allowing
  GTP to bind, and precludes the interaction of RAB27 with GDI and CHM proteins.
