display_name: Recruitment of transition zone proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The transition zone is a protein-rich zone at the base of the cilium that
  forms after maturation of the mother centriole and prior to or concurrent with the
  initiation of intraflagellar transport (IFT) (reviewed in Benzing and Schermer,
  2011; Reiter et al, 2012). The transition zone consists of a growing number of proteins
  and protein complexes, many of whose genes are associated with ciliopathies such
  as nephronophthisis, Meckel-Gruber syndrome and Joubert's syndrome (Reiter et al,
  2006; Hu et al, 2010; Sang et al, 2011; Williams et al, 2011; Garcia-Gonzalo et
  al, 2011; Chih et al, 2012; reviewed in Reiter et al, 2012). In conjunction with
  SEPT2, which was recently shown to form a septin ring diffusion barrier at the base
  of the cilium, the transition zone and its resident proteins contribute to protein
  sorting and ciliary membrane composition and act as a ciliary gate (Hu et al, 2010;
  Williams et al, 2011; Garcia-Gonzalo et al, 2011; Chih et al, 2012; reviewed in
  Reiter et al, 2012).
