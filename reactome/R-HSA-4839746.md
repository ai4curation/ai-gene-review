display_name: Truncated AMER1 mutants destabilize the destruction complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AMER1/WTX is a known component of the destruction complex and interacts directly
  with beta-catenin through the C-terminal half (Major et al, 2007).  siRNA depletion
  of AMER1 in mammalian cells stabilizes cellular beta-catenin levels and increases
  the expression of a beta-catenin-dependent reporter gene, suggesting that AMER1
  is a tumor suppressor gene (Major et al, 2007; reviewed in Huff, 2011).  Consistent
  with this, nonsense and missense mutations that truncate AMER1 and result in loss
  of the beta-catenin binding region have been identified in Wilms tumor, a pediatric
  kidney cancer (Ruteshouser et al, 2008; Wegert et al, 2009).
