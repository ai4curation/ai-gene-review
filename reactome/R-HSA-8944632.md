display_name: miR-106 microRNAs bind PTEN mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'MicroRNA miR-106b-5p, one of the two mature products of miR-106b, binds
  the 3''UTR of PTEN mRNA (Poliseno et al. 2010). miR-106b causes reduction in both
  PTEN mRNA and protein levels and is thus shown to function as a part of the endonucleolytic
  RISC. It is possible that miR-106b also functions as a part of the nonendonucleolytic
  RISC. MicroRNA miR-106a-5p, one of the two mature products of miR-106a, is homologous
  to miR-106b and binds to the 3''UTR of PTEN mRNA. miR-106a presumably functions
  in a manner similar to miR-106b (Tay et al. 2011). '

## Summary

MicroRNA miR-106b-5p, one of the two mature products of miR-106b, binds the 3'UTR of PTEN mRNA (Poliseno et al. 2010). miR-106b causes reduction in both PTEN mRNA and protein levels and is thus shown to function as a part of the endonucleolytic RISC. It is possible that miR-106b also functions as a part of the nonendonucleolytic RISC. MicroRNA miR-106a-5p, one of the two mature products of miR-106a, is homologous to miR-106b and binds to the 3'UTR of PTEN mRNA. miR-106a presumably functions in a manner similar to miR-106b (Tay et al. 2011).
