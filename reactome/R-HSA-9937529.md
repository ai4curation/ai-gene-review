stable_id: R-HSA-9937529
display_name: TRMT61B methylates adenosine-616 and adenosine-617 of MT-CYB mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRMT61B methylates the N1 position in adenosine residues of tRNA (Chujo and
  Suzuki 2012) and mRNA (Li et al. 2017). TRMT61B methylates adenosine-616 and adenosine-617
  residues of the MT-CYB mRNA. N1-methyladenosine in mitochondrial mRNA appears to
  cause ribosome stalling that results in reduced translation (Li et al. 2017). TRMT61B
  forms large homooligomeric complexes that are presumed to contain homotetramers
  (Chujo and Suzuki 2012, also PDB 2B25).
