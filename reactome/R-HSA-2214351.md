stable_id: R-HSA-2214351
display_name: PLK1 phosphorylates GORASP1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of GORASP1 (GRASP65) enables GORASP1 to recruit
  PLK1 (Preisinger et al. 2005). PLK1 phosphorylates GORASP1 on serine residue S189
  (Sengupta and Linstedt 2010). This serine residue is near the GORASP1 region involved
  in GORASP1 dimerization and oligomerization, a process underlying the stacking of
  cis-Golgi cisternae (Wang et al. 2003). The phosphorylation of S189 by PLK1 impairs
  Golgi cisternae stacking (tethering), contributing to Golgi unlinking and fragmentation
  in mitosis, probably by preventing formation of GORASP1 dimers and oligomers (Sutterlin
  et al. 2001, Sengupta and Linstedt, 2010). Two other potential phosphorylation sites
  that match PLK1 substrate consensus sequence exist in GORASP1, but their functional
  significance has not yet been examined (Sengupta and Linstedt, 2010).
