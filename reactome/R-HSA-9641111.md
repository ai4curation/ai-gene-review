display_name: Parkin transfers Ub to misfolded proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Misfolded proteins in the cytosol are tagged with ubiquitin molecules via
  the E2 UBE2N/UBE2V1 conjugation complex and E3 ligase Parkin. Misfolded proteins
  bind Parkin and subsequently Parkin transfers ubiquitin from E2 complex to the proteins
  (Olzmann JA et al. 2007).

## Summary

Misfolded proteins in the cytosol are tagged with ubiquitin molecules via the E2 UBE2N/UBE2V1 conjugation complex and E3 ligase Parkin. Misfolded proteins bind Parkin and subsequently Parkin transfers ubiquitin from E2 complex to the proteins (Olzmann JA et al. 2007).
