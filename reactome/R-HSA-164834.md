display_name: Enzyme-bound ATP is released
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the last step, the beta subunit is converted to the open form and ATP
  is released. Passage of protons through the Fo part causes a ring of approximately
  10 subunits to rotate. This rotation in turn drives the rotation of the gamma subunits,
  which forms part of one of the stalks. The gamma subunit moves between the three
  beta subunits which are held in place by the second stalk which can be regarded
  as a stator. The polypeptide called OSCP connects the stator stalk to the assembly
  of alpha and beta subunits. It is this step that is coupled  to proton translocation
  as energy is required to break the strong bond between ATP and the protein.
