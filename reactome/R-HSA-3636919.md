display_name: Defective CHST14 does not transfer SO4(2-) to GalNAc in dermatan or
  DS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 14 (CHST14) (Evers et al. 2001) mediates the
  transfer of sulfate to position 4 of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue of dermatan
  or to a further GalNAc residue of dermatan sulfate (D2,4(S)2-PG) in iduronate rich
  domains. As 4-O sulfation by CHST14 is essential for DS formation, defective CHST14
  results in much lower levels of DS and higher levels of chondroitin sulfate (CS)
  being produced. DS plays an important role in human development and extracellular
  matrix maintenance and defective CHST14 results in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,  musculocontractural
  type (MIM:601776). Mutations causing this disease include V49*, R213P, R135G/L137Q,
  Y293, P281L and the compound heterozygotes P281L/K69* and P281L/C285S (Dundar et
  al. 2009, Miyake et al. 2010).
