display_name: Phosphorylated STAT1, STAT3 form dimers
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STATs can form dimers in the unphosphorylated state but only phosphorylated
  dimers are in the correct conformation to to bind consensus DNA sequences of target
  genes in the nucleus (Riech & Liu 2006).

## Summary

STATs can form dimers in the unphosphorylated state but only phosphorylated dimers are in the correct conformation to to bind consensus DNA sequences of target genes in the nucleus (Riech & Liu 2006).
