display_name: PI3K-containing complexes phosphorylate PIP2 to PIP3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PI3K can be activated downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such
  as insulin receptor IGF1R (Hadari et al. 1992, Kooijman et al. 1995). In unstimulated
  cells, PI3K class IA exists as an inactive heterodimer of a p85 regulatory subunit
  (encoded by PIK3R1, PIK3R2 or PIK3R3) and a p110 catalytic subunit (encoded by PIK3CA,
  PIK3CB or PIK3CD). Binding of the iSH2 domain of the p85 regulatory subunit to the
  ABD and C2 domains of the p110 catalytic subunit both stabilizes p110 and inhibits
  its catalytic activity. This inhibition is relieved when the SH2 domains of p85
  bind phosphorylated tyrosines on activated RTKs or their adaptor proteins. Binding
  to membrane-associated receptors brings activated PI3K in proximity to its membrane-localized
  substrate, PIP2, facilitating phosphorylation (Mandelker et al. 2009, Burke et al.
  2011; reviewed in Koyasu et al, 2003; Engelman et al, 2006).

## Summary
