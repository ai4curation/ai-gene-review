display_name: Formation of RTC with integration competent viral DNA:BANF1:HMGA1:PSIP1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The DNA in the Pre-initiation complex is considerably compacted relative
  to its length when fully extended, probably due to binding of proteins in addition
  to the viral integrase. These proteins are not fully clarified, due to the difficulty
  of biochemical  analysis of small amounts of material, but candidates include the
  viral NC and MA proteins, and the cellular HMGA, BAF, and PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 proteins.
  Purified integrase is capable of carrying out the terminal cleavage and initial
  strand transfer reactions.
