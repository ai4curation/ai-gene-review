stable_id: R-HSA-8936676
display_name: Moderate kinase activity BRAF mutants:RAS:GTP homo/heterodimerize
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In addition to the prevalent and highly activating V600E mutation, a large
  number of rare, moderately activating BRAF mutations are also found in human cancers
  (Wan et al, 2004; Davies et al, 2002).  Unlike the V600E mutant, these forms of
  BRAF require both RAS binding and dimerization to activate MAPK/ERK signaling (Wan
  et al, 2004; Freeman et al, 2013; reviewed in Lavoie and Therrien, 2015).
