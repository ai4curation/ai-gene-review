## Summary

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a key regulator of gene expression in response to signaling of many cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL6), Oncostatin M (OSM), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Using microarray techniques, hundreds of genes have been reported as potential STAT3 target genes (Dauer et al. 2005, Hsieh et al. 2005). Some have been confirmed as direct STAT3 targets using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation screening (Snyder et al. 2008, Carpenter & Lo 2014). <br><br>Genes for extracellular proteins that are upregulated by STAT3 include Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) (Schumann et al. 1996), IL10 (Schaefer et al. 2009), IL23A (Kortylewski et al. 2009), Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1) (Kinjyo et al. 2006), Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1, Interstitial collagenase) (Itoh et al. 2006), MMP2 (Xie et al. 2004), MMP3 (Liu et al. 2013), MMP9 (Song et al. 2009), Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (LCN2) (Jung et al. 2012, Xu et al. 2015), Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) (Bosquet et al. 2000), Serum amyloid A-1 protein (SAA1) (Hagihara et al. 2005), Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) (Niu et al. 2002), Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) (Huang et al. 2013), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Hung & Elliot 2001), IL17A, IL17F (Durant et al. 2010) and Metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1) (Adamson et al. 2013).
