display_name: G6B binds PTPN6,PTPN11
species: Homo sapiens
summary: G6B is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The G6B-B variant is the
  only variant to contain both a transmembrane region and two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that support binding to the SH2 domain-containing protein
  tyrosine phosphatases PTPN6 (SHP1) and PTPN11 (SHP2) (de Vet et al. 2001, Senis
  et al. 2007). ITIMs are defined by the consensus sequence (L/I/V/S)-X-Y-X-X-(L/V)
  and are commonly present in pairs separated by 15 to 30 amino acid residues.  ITIM-containing
  receptors were originally identified by their ability to inhibit signaling by ITAM
  receptors (Bijsterbosch & Klaus 1985). Expression of the GPVI-FcR gamma-chain complex
  orC-type lectin domain family 1 member B (CLEC1B, CLEC2) in DT40 (chicken) B cells
  leads to the generation of both constitutive and agonist-induced signals that are
  inhibited by G6B. This effect is dependent on the two ITIMs in the cytosolic tail
  of G6B, but is reported to be independent of the two SH2 domain-containing tyrosine
  phosphatases PTPN6 and PTPN11, and the inositol lipid 5”²-phosphatase SHIP1 (Mori
  et al. 2008). A more recent study (Coxon et al. 2011) found that other SH2 domain-containing
  proteins including SYK and PLCgamma2 also recognize G6B phosphomotifs, which may
  explain why G6B remains inhibitory in the absence of both PTPN6 and PTPN11. <br><br>The
  tandem SH2 domains of PTPN11 have a 100-fold higher binding affinity for G6B than
  that of PTPN6. PTPN6 has an absolute binding requirement for phosphorylation at
  both ITAM motifs, while PTPN11 can associate with G6B when only one motif is phosphorylated.
  The presence of dual phosphorylated G6B in washed human platelets reduced the EC(50)
  for both CRP and collagen-induced aggregation (Coxon et al. 2011). G6B is proposed
  to inhibit sustained constitutive signaling from GPVI-FcRgamma and CLEC1B (Mori
  et al. 2008).
