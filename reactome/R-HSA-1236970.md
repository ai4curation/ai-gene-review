stable_id: R-HSA-1236970
display_name: Proteasomal clevage of exogenous antigen (26S proteasome catalyst)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Exogenous antigens are thought to be processed for cross-presentation by
  the 26S proteasome in much the same manner as endogenous proteins once they enter
  the cytosolic pathway (Rock et al. 2010). Additionally, exogenous antigens can be
  processed by the immunoproteasome, as described in the reaction catalyzed by immunoproteasomes
  (Palmowski et al. 2006). The precurssor peptides are further trimmed by cytosolic
  aminopeptidases and shuttled to ER through TAP for MHC class I loading.
