stable_id: R-HSA-2160884
display_name: HA:HAR:HYAL2 binds to SLC9A1:p-CHP:Ca2+
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Hyaluronidases are only active in acidic environments. HYAL2 can interact
  with the Na+-H+ exchanger (SLC9A1, NHE1) which can create an acidic microenvironment
  in the caveolae. Extracellular Na+ ions are exchanged for protons which creates
  the acidic conditions required for the activity of HYAL2 (Bourguignon et al. 2004).
  The interaction of calcineurin homologous protein 1 (CHP1) with SLC9A1 is essential
  for the maintenance of, or increasing, the pH sensitivity of SLC9A1 thus CHP1 can
  regulate SLC9A1 activity (Lin & Barber 1996, Pang et al. 2004, Mishima et al. 2007).
  CHP1 depletion in Xenopus oocytes results in a dramatic reduction (>90%) in the
  Na+-H+ exchange activity of SLC9A1 (Pang et al. 2001).
