display_name: Retrograde COPI vesicles bind kinesin and microtubules
species: Homo sapiens
summary: COPI-mediated retrograde traffic is dependent on microtubules and the plus-end
  motor kinsesin.  Although it is not shown in this reaction, vesicle translocation
  along the microtubules by kinesin depends on ATP hydrolysis (Lippincott-Scwartz
  et al, 1995; Stauber et al, 2006; Tomas et al, 2010)
