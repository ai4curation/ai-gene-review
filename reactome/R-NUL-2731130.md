display_name: Syndecan-1 binds integrin alphaVbeta5
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Syndecans have attached heparan sulfate (HS) and to a lesser extent chondroitin
  sulfate (CS) chains. These allow interactions with a large number of proteins. Various
  enzymes involved in post-translational HS chain modifications produce unique binding
  motifs that selectively recognize different proteins (Tkachenko et al. 2005). It
  is thought that syndecans often act in concert with other receptors, e.g. integrins
  alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 cooperate with syndecan-1 during adhesion to vitronectin
  (Beauvais et al. 2004, McQuade et al. 2006). The relationship between syndecans
  and co-receptors is not well understood (Alexopoulou et al. 2007). Syndecan-null
  mice have subtle phenotypes when compared with mice deficient in HS chain synthesis
  or modification (Echtermeyer et al. 2001, Ishiquro et al. 2001, Götte et al. 2002).
  GPI-anchored glypicans and matrix HSPGs such as perlecan may compensate for the
  absence of syndecans.

## Summary

Syndecans have attached heparan sulfate (HS) and to a lesser extent chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains. These allow interactions with a large number of proteins. Various enzymes involved in post-translational HS chain modifications produce unique binding motifs that selectively recognize different proteins (Tkachenko et al. 2005).

The relationship between syndecans and co-receptors is not well understood (Alexopoulou et al. 2007). Syndecan-null mice have subtle phenotypes when compared with mice deficient in HS chain synthesis or modification (Echtermeyer et al. 2001, Ishiquro et al. 2001, Götte et al. 2002).
