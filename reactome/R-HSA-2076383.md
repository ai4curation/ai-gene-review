stable_id: R-HSA-2076383
display_name: HS3ST1 sulfates GlcN at C3 in heparan sulfate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase1 (HS3ST1) transfers sulfate to the 3-OH
  position on glucosamine (GlcN) residues of heparan sulfate (HS) to form 3-O-sulfated
  HS. HS3ST1 is the rate limiting enzyme for synthesis of anticoagulant heparan sulfate.
  Unlike the other members of the HS3ST family, it is probably located in the Golgi
  lumen (Shworak et al. 1997).
