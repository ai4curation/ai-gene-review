summary: 'Hyaluronan (HA) turnover can occur locally at the tissue of origin, where
  it is taken up by cells to be degraded, or released into the lymphatic and vascular
  systems, where it can be eliminated by the liver and kidneys. Uptake of HA into
  cells for degradation involves receptor-mediated processes. Once HA enters lysosomes,
  the acidic conditions favour hyaluronidases to cleave it into small oligosaccharides,
  the most common size being a tetrasaccharide. Beta-glucuronidases participate in
  degrading the small oligosaccharides in the lysosome. Ultimately, HA is degraded
