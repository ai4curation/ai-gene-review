display_name: TRAF6 binding leads to IRAK1:TRAF6 release
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MyD88 and Tollip only bind to non-phosphorylated IRAK1 (Wesche et al. 1997)
  so hyper-phosphorylated IRAK1 is predisposed to release from the receptor complex,
  a key step in this signaling cascade. It is believed that the interaction of IRAK1
  with TRAF6 enables the release of IRAK1:TRAF6 from the receptor (Gottipati et al.
  2007). Though released from the receptor complex, IRAK1:TRAF6 remains associated
  with the membrane, perhaps due to subsequent interaction with the TAK1 complex (Dong
  et al. 2006). Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK3 or IRAK-M) prevents
  the dissociation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 from the MYD88 oligomeric signaling complex
  called the Myddosome (Kobayashi K et al. 2002).
