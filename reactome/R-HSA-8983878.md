display_name: p-STAT4 dissociates from IL12RB2:IL12RB2 receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-35 (IL35) can signal via IL35 receptors triggering the JAK/STAT
  pathway downstream. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4-alpha/beta
  (STAT4) binds to the JAK associated-IL35 receptor complex and are activated via
  phosphorylations. Subsequently, phosphorylated p-STAT4 dissociates from the receptor
  complex (Collison et al. 2012). This is a black box event because there is no literature
  evidence about the exact mechanism of the release of STAT4 from the receptor complex.
