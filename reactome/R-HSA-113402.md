species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'NELF complex is a ~ 300 kDa multiprotein complex composed of 5 peptides
  (A - E): ~66,61,59,58 and 46 kDa. All these peptides are required for NELF-mediated
  inhibition of  Pol II elongation.  NELF complex has been reported to bind to the
  pre-formed DSIF:RNA Pol II complex that may act as a scaffold for its binding.  NELF-A
  is suspected to be involved in Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. <BR>Binding of DSIF:NELF
  to RNA Pol II CTD results in abortive termination of early elongation steps by the
  growing transcripts.'
