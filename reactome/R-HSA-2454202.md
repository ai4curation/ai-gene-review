summary: Mast cells (MC) are distributed in tissues throughout the human body and
  have long been recognized as key cells of type I hypersensitivity reactions. They
  also play important roles in inflammatory and immediate allergic reactions. Activation
  through FCERI-bound antigen-specific IgE causes release of potent inflammatory mediators,
  such as histamine, proteases, chemotactic factors, cytokines and metabolites of
  arachidonic acid that act on the vasculature, smooth muscle, connective tissue,
  mucous glands and inflammatory cells (Borish & Joseph 1992, Amin 2012, Metcalfe
  et al. 1993). FCERI is a multimeric cell-surface receptor that binds the Fc fragment
  of IgE with high affinity. On mast cells and basophils FCERI exists as a tetrameric
  complex consisting of one alpha-chain, one beta-chain, and two disulfide-bonded
  gamma-chains, and on dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, macrophages, and eosinophils
  it exists as a trimeric complex with one alpha-chain and two disulfide-bonded gamma-chains
  (Wu 2011, Kraft & Kinet 2007). FCERI signaling in mast cells includes a network
  of signaling molecules and adaptor proteins. These molecules coordinate ultimately
  leading to effects on degranulation, eicosanoid production, and cytokine and chemokine
  production and cell migration and adhesion, growth and survival.<br>The first step
  in FCERI signaling is the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the ITAM of
  both the beta and the gamma subunits of the FCERI by LYN, which is bound to the
  FCERI beta-chain. The phosphorylated ITAM then recruits the protein tyrosine kinase
  SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) which then phosphorylates the adaptor protein LAT.
  Phosphorylated LAT (linker for activation of T cells) acts as a scaffolding protein
  and recruits other cytosolic adaptor molecules GRB2 (growth-factor-receptor-bound
  protein 2), GADS (GRB2-related adaptor protein), SHC (SRC homology 2 (SH2)-domain-containing
  transforming protein C) and SLP76 (SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76
  kDa), as well as the exchange factors and adaptor molecules VAV and SOS (son of
  sevenless homologue), and the signalling enzyme phospholipase C gamma1 (PLC-gamma1).
  Tyrosoine phosphorylation of enzymes and adaptors, including VAV, SHC GRB2 and SOS
  stimulate small GTPases such as RAC, RAS and RAF. These pathways lead to activation
  of the ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases, histamine release and cytokine production.
  FCERI activation also triggers the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma which upon membrane
  localisation hydrolyse PIP2 to form IP3 and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) - second messengers
  that release Ca2+ from internal stores and activate PKC, respectively. Degranulation
  or histamine release follows the activation of PLC-gamma and protein kinase C (PKC)
  and the increased mobilization of calcium (Ca2+). Receptor aggregation also results
  in the phosphorylation of adaptor protein NTAL/LAT2 which then recruits GAB2. PI3K
  associates with phosphorylated GAB2 and catalyses the formation of PIP3 in the membrane,
  which attracts many PH domain proteins like BTK, PLC-gamma, AKT and PDK. PI3K mediated
  activation of AKT then regulate the mast cell proliferation, development and survival
  (Gu et al. 2001).

## Summary

Mast cells (MC) are distributed in tissues throughout the human body and have long been recognized as key cells of type I hypersensitivity reactions.
