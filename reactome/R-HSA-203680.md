stable_id: R-HSA-203680
display_name: eNOS:NOSIP translocation from caveolae to intracellular compartments
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NOSIP promotes translocation of eNOS from the plasma membrane to intracellular
  sites, thereby uncoupling eNOS from plasma membrane caveolae and inhibiting NO synthesis.
  eNOS appears to be shifted to intracellular sites that colocalize with Golgi and/or
  cytoskeletal marker proteins.
