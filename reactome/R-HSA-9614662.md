display_name: FOXO1,FOXO3,(FOXO4) bind FASLG gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Unphosphorylated FOXO1 (Ciechomska et al. 2003) and FOXO3 (Brunet et al.
  1999), and possibly FOXO4, can bind to three Forkhead-responsive elements in the
  promoter of the FASLG gene. The FASLG gene encodes FAS ligand (also known as TNFSF6
  or CD95-L), a cytokine that binds the FAS receptor (TNFRSF6) and triggers extrinsic
  apoptosis pathway. AKT-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3 prevents binding of FOXO3
  to the FASLG promoter (Brunet et al. 1999).
