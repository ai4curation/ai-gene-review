display_name: UV-DDB ubiquitinates XPC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The role of UV-DDB-mediated ubiquitination in global genome nucleotide excision
  repair (GG-NER) has not been fully elucidated.<p>In the absence of DNA damage, the
  ubiquitin ligase activity of UV-DDB complex is inhibited by association with the
  COP9 signalosome (CSN complex), which dissociates from the UV-DDB complex upon binding
  to damaged DNA (Groisman et al. 2003, Fischer et al. 2011). Ubiquitination of XPC
  by UV-DDB promotes XPC retention at GG-NER sites, while progressive autoubiquitination
  of UV-DDB promotes the dissociation of UV-DDB from the DNA and may act as an intracellular
  signal (Sugasawa et al. 2005). The UV-DDB complex also ubiquitinates histones H2A,
  H3 and H4, which may trigger chromatin remodeling at DNA damage site and regulate
  the accessibility of damaged DNA to repair factors (Kapetanaki et al. 2006, Wang
  et al. 2006).
