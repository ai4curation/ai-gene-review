display_name: Frataxin binds iron
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Frataxin (FXN) specifically binds 2 atoms of ferrous iron per monomer (reviewed
  in Stemmler et al. 2010). Iron bound to Frataxin may (Yoon and Cowan 2003, Gerber
  et al. 2003) or may not (Schmucker et al. 2011) enhance the interaction of Frataxin
  with NFS1, ICSU, and ISD11. Frataxin was shown to stimulate the cysteine desulfurase
  activity of NFS1 and was proposed to be a regulator of sulfur production (Tsai et
  al. 2010). The formation of sulfide by NFS1 is most efficiently observed when NFS1
  is in complex with ISD11, ISCU, and FXN in the presence of cysteine and iron. This
  means that only the complete system of NFS1, ISD11, ISCU, FXN, cysteine, and iron
  is fully active as a desulfurase. FXN therefore seems to be a regulator of the cysteine
  desulfurase permitting sulfide production only when all components needed for Fe-S
  cluster synthesis are present and the ISCU-bound Fe-S cluster can be formed.
