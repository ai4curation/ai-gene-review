display_name: Intermediate 2 binds MT-ND1:NDUFAF5:NDUFAF6 to form a 315kDa subcomplex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A complex I intermediate of 315kDa (reestimated from the original 400kDa)
  is formed centred around the core subunits NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur
  proteins 2 and 3 (NDUFS2 and NDUFS3) with other complex I subunits and assembly
  factor subunits (forming IP and HP subcomplexes). The IP subcomplex is anchored
  to the inner mitochondrial membrane by NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1 (MT-ND1)
  (together with NDUFAF5 and/or 6) (Mckenzie & Ryan 2010, Andrews et al. 2013). NADH
  dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex assembly factor 8 (NDUFAF8) and Protein
  preY (PYURF, NDUFAFQ) are required for stabilization of NDUFAF5 (Floyd et al., 2016;
  Rensvold et al., 2022; Peker et al., 2023). Defects in NDUFAF8 cause Complex I deficiency,
  manifesting as Leigh syndrome (Alston et al., 2019).
