display_name: Autophosphorylation of cytosolic PDGFRA and PDGFRB fusion proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Where examined, cytosolic fusion proteins of PDGFRA and B have been shown
  to undergo constitutive trans-autophosphorylation in the absence of ligand (Cools
  et al, 2003; Stover et al, 2006; Salemi et al, 2009; reviewed in Reilly et al, 2003;
  Wang et al, 2016; Appiah-Kubi et al, 2017). Although downstream signaling has not
  been investigated in detail, the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion has been shown to signal through
  STAT5 and its expression in Ba/F3 murine cell line promotes oncogenic transformation
  (Cools et al, 2003).
