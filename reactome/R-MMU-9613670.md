display_name: p-Plins translocate from lipid droplet surface to cytosol
species: Mus musculus
summary: Lipophagy is the process of autophagic degradation of lipid droplets into
  fatty acids. Lipid droplets are coated with perilipin (Plin) protiens and they need
  to be eliminated for the degradation of the lipids inside. Cytosolic Heat shock
  cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) binds Plin2 and Plin3 on the lipid droplet surface.
  Subsequently, Prkaa2 binds and phosphorylates perilipins. Phosphorylated Plins dissociate
  from Prkaa2 and are believed to translocate to the cytosol (S Kaushik et al. 2015,
  S Kaushik et al. 2016). The translocation mechanism of Plins from lipid droplets
  to cytosol is unclear. Consequently, this event is considered as a black box.
