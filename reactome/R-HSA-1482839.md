stable_id: R-HSA-1482839
display_name: Acyl chain remodelling of PE
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the acyl chain remodelling pathway (Lands cycle),  phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) is hydrolyzed by phopholipases and subsequently reacylated by acyltransferases.
  These cycles modify the fatty acid composition of glycerophospholipids to generate
  diverse molecules asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane (Ghomashchi et
  al. 2010, Singer et al. 2002, Cao et al. 2008, Zhao et al. 2008, Hishikawa et al.
  2008).
