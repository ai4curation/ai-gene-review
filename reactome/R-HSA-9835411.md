display_name: FA core complex:HSP70s binds PKR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Fanconi anemia group C protein (FANCC), as part of a complex of the Fanconi
  anemia core complex with HSP70 proteins, binds to PKR inhibiting its activation
  (Pang et al, 2001a; Pang et al, 2001b; Pang et al, 2002). PKR is constitutively
  activated in cells with mutations in the Fanconi anemia genes FANCA, FANCC, and
  FANCG, leading to hypersensitivity of bone marrow progenitor cells to growth repression
  and cell death (Zhang et al, 2004).
