display_name: LIAS synthesizes lipoyl-GCSH
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mitochondrial lipoyl synthase (LIAS) mediates the radical-mediated insertion
  of two sulfur atoms into the C-6 and C-8 positions of the octanoyl moiety bound
  to glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH), transforming the octanoyl moiety to
  a lipoyl moiety. LIAS requires two 4Fe-4S clusters as cofactors, which act as the
  sulfur donors in the reaction. It also requires ferredoxin FDX1 as a cofactor. Moreover,
  LIAS is in complex with iron-sulfur cluster scaffold NFU1, which restores the auxiliary
  cluster of LIAS during turnover (Morikawa et al., 2001; Warui et al., 2022; Dreishpoon
  et al., 2023; Joshi et al., 2023). Defects in LIAS can cause neonatal-onset epilepsy,
  defective mitochondrial energy metabolism, and glycine elevation (HGCLAS, MIM:614462;
  Mayr et al., 2011; reviewed by Cronan, 2020).
