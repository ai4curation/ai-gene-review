display_name: Progesterone Activation Of CatSper
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Steroid hormone progesterone released by cumulus cells surrounding the egg
  is a potent stimulator of human spermatozoa. It attracts spermatozoa towards the
  egg and helps them penetrate the egg's protective vestments. Progesterone induces
  Ca2+ influx into spermatozoa and triggers multiple Ca2+-dependent physiological
  responses essential for successful fertilization, such as sperm hyperactivation,
  acrosome reaction and chemotaxis towards the egg. Progesterone dramatically potentiates
  CatSper calcium transport activity, identifying CatSper as the progesterone receptor
  of sperm.
