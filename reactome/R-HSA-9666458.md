## Summary

In addition to the membrane remodeling for pseudopod extension, particle internalization requires a contractility force pulling the forming phagosome into the cytoplasm. Myosin motor proteins are the actin-binding proteins, with ATPase activity move along actin fibers, and produce the driving force for phagosome formation and transport. Several myosin motors including myosins IC, II, V, IXb are involved in FCGR-mediated phagocytosis as force generators and actin-based transport motors (Swanson et al. 1999). Nonmuscle myosin II, is a motor protein known to generate intracellular contractile forces and tension by associating with F-actin. It has been observed to localize around forming phagosomes and suggested a role in phagocytic-cup squeezing during FCGR-mediated phagocytosis. Each myosin II motor protein exists as a complex consisting of two copies each of myosin II heavy chain (MHC), essential light chains (ELC), and myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC).
