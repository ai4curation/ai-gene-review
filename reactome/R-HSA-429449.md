display_name: Syk activation leads to SLP-76 activation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Stimulation of platelets with collagen-related peptide leads to tyrosine
  phosphorylation of SLP-76, an adaptor protein with multiple binding domains (Gross
  et al. 1999). Phosphorylation of SLP-76 is mediated by Syk, analogous to the role
  of ZAP-70 in phosphorylating T-cell SLP-76 (Bubeck-Wardenberg et al. 1996, Hussain
  et al. 1999, Fasbender et al. 2017). SLP-76 was shown to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated
  C-terminal tail of SYK (de Castro et al. 2012). The phosphorylated tyrosine residues
  provide a binding site for the SH2 domains of downstream signalling proteins like
  Vav, Itk and ADAP (Jordan et al. 2003). Platelets from mice defective in SLP76 do
  not connect GPVI engagement with downstream signaling (Clements et al. 1999, Judd
  et al. 2000). GPVI signaling via SLP-76 does not appear to require LAT or GADS (Judd
  et al. 2002) suggesting that the mechanism is not identical to that of T-cells.
  LAT and SLP-76 are both required for P-selectin expression and degranulation but
  may function independently, or rely on proteins not required by T-cells (Jordan
  et al. 2003).
