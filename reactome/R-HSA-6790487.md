stable_id: R-HSA-6790487
display_name: RNF111 ubiquitinates SUMOylated XPC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SUMOylated XPC is recognized by the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF111
  (Arcadia) that, together with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating complex of UBE2N (UBC13)
  and UBE2V2 (MMS2), generates K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on XPC (Poulsen et
  al. 2013) to efficiently release XPC from UV lesions (van Cuijk et al. 2015). The
  release of K63-polyubiquitinated XPC occurs from GG-NER pre-incision complexes that
  contain TFIIH and XPA and promotes optimal access/binding of ERCC5 (XPG) endonuclease
  to the pre-incision complex (van Cuijk et al. 2015). Successful binding of ERCC5
  endonuclease 3' to the damage facilitates binding of the ERCC1:ERCC4 (ERCC1:XPF)
  endonuclease and progression of the NER reaction.
