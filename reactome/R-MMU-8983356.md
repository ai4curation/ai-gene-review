display_name: Il15:Il15ra:p-Y-Il2rb:p-Y-Jak1:p-Y-Il2rg:p-Y-Jak3:p-Y-Shc1 binds Grb2
species: Mus musculus
summary: GRB2 is recruited by phosphorylated SHC1 in the IL15 receptor complex (Zambricki
  et al. 2005, Gadina et al. 2000), as it is in the Interleukin-2 receptor complex
  (Li et al. 1994, Bennett et al. 1994).More in detail, human and mouse IL15 have
  70.2% amino acid sequence similarity and exhibit similar trans-presentation mechanism,
  signal transduction machinery and biological activities. Similarly, human IL15 shows
  cross-reactivity with mouse cells and it was demonstrated that human and mouse IL15
  showed similar responses in mouse models (Stoklasek et al. 2006) (Patidar et al.
  data not published).
