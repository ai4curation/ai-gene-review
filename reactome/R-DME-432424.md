stable_id: R-DME-432424
display_name: JET binds phosphorylated nuclear TIM, facilitating its ubiquitination
species: Drosophila melanogaster
summary: There is competition for binding to the E3 ligase protein Jetlag (JET) from
  both Timeless (TIM) and cryptochrome (CRY), with TIM being the stronger binder.  The
  initial complex formed between CRY and phosphorylated TIM helps promote the interaction
  between the F-box domain containing protein JET with phosphorylated TIM, facilitating
  ubiquitination of the latter protein, marking it for processing by the 26S proteasome.
