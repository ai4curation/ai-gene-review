stable_id: R-HSA-427527
display_name: eNoSC dimethylates histone H3 at lysine-9
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The SUV39H1 component of eNoSC dimethylates histone H3 at lysine-9 (Murayama
  et al. 2008). The reaction depends on the prior deacetylation reaction catalyzed
  by the SIRT1 component of eNoSC. Histone H3 dimethylated at lysine-9 inhibits expression
  of rRNA genes.
