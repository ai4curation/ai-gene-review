summary: 'Activation of a subset of FGFR1-fusions (ZMYM2, BCR, FGFR1OP2 and CUX) has
  been shown to result in downstream phosphorylation of STAT5 proteins at Y694.  This
  phosphorylation is dependent on the FGFR1 fusion, as the STAT5 phosphorylation is
  abrogated in the presence of an FGFR1-kinase dead fusion (Heath and Cross, 2004;

## Summary

Activation of a subset of FGFR1-fusions (ZMYM2, BCR, FGFR1OP2 and CUX) has been shown to result in downstream phosphorylation of STAT5 proteins at Y694.  This phosphorylation is dependent on the FGFR1 fusion, as the STAT5 phosphorylation is abrogated in the presence of an FGFR1-kinase dead fusion (Heath and Cross, 2004; Smedley, 1999; Chase, 2007; Wasage, 2011).
