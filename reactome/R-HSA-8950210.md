display_name: Interleukin-27 dissociates from Interleukin-27 receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-27 heterodimer (IL27) binds a heterodimeric receptor formed by
  Interleukin-27 subunit alpha (IL27RA) and Interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta (IL6ST,
  gp130). In the absence of IL27RA IL27 can bind IL6ST with low affinity. Dissociation
  rate constants for binding of IL27 to the heterodimeric receptor indicate a slow
  dissociation rate, resulting in very high binding affinity. Blocking both receptor
  chains completely blocks IL27 induced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and IL27 induced
  proliferation (Jia et al. 2016).

In the absence of IL27RA IL27 can bind IL6ST with low affinity. Dissociation rate constants for binding of IL27 to the heterodimeric receptor indicate a slow dissociation rate, resulting in very high binding affinity.
