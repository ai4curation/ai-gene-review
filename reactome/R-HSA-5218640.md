stable_id: R-HSA-5218640
display_name: SRC-1 phosphorylates p-Y397-PTK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Src family kinases (SFKs) induce transphosphorylation of tyrosyl residues
  Y576, Y577, Y861 and Y925. Phosphorylation of Y576 and Y577 within the catalytic
  domain confers maximal FAK1 enzymatic activity and signaling in response to adhesion
  (Calalb et al. 1995, Brunton et al. 2005). Y576 and Y861 are both phosphorylated
  in a Src-dependent manner in response to VEGF (Abu-Ghazaleh et al. 2001, Le Boeuf
  et al. 2006, 2004). Phosphorylation of FAK on Y861 contributes to the recruitment
  of vinculin to FAK1 (Le Boeuf et al. 2004).
