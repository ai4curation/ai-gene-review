stable_id: R-HSA-909724
display_name: Recruitment of IFNAR1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The extracellular domain of IFNAR1 is atypical, consisting of a tandem array
  of four FNIII domains and the first three N-terminal FNIII domains are involved
  in ligand recognition. IFNAR1 is recruited to the binary complex (IFNA/B:IFNAR2)
  on the membrane to form the ternary complex (IFNAR2:IFNA/B:IFNAR1). TYK2 kinase
  is pre-associated with IFNAR1 and JAK1 with IFNAR2. The binding of IFNA/B to IFNA
  receptors brings these JAK kinase together, allowing cross-phosphorylation and kinase
  activation.
