display_name: PKM and TGIF2 bind CDH1 gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Pyruvate kinase PKM (also known as PKM2) and TGF-beta-induced transcription
  factor 2 (TGIF2) form a complex that binds to the CDH1 gene promoter (Hamabe et
  al. 2014; Yang et al. 2022). The complex of PKM and TGIF2 at the CDH1 promoter may
  include histone deacetylase HDAC3 (Hamabe et al. 2014) and a Protein phosphatase
  1 regulatory subunit 26 (PPP1R26) (Yang et al. 2022).
