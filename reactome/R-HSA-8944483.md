stable_id: R-HSA-8944483
display_name: miR-17 microRNA binds PTEN mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'MicroRNA miR-17-5p, one of the two mature products of miR-17, binds the
  3''UTR of PTEN mRNA (Xiao et al. 2008, Poliseno et al. 2010). miR-17 causes reduction
  in both PTEN mRNA and protein levels and is thus shown to function as a part of
  the endonucleolytic RISC. It is possible that miR-17 also functions as a part of
  the nonendonucleolytic RISC. '

## Summary

MicroRNA miR-17-5p, one of the two mature products of miR-17, binds the 3'UTR of PTEN mRNA (Xiao et al. 2008, Poliseno et al. 2010). miR-17 causes reduction in both PTEN mRNA and protein levels and is thus shown to function as a part of the endonucleolytic RISC. It is possible that miR-17 also functions as a part of the nonendonucleolytic RISC.
