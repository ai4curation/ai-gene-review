stable_id: R-HSA-5250930
display_name: B-WICH recruits histone acetyltransferases
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Direct interactions between BAZ1B (WSTF) and histone acetyltransferases KAT2B,
  KAT2A, and EP300 are weak (Vintermist et al. 2011) so the acetyltransferases may
  interact with other subunits of B‑WICH or with proteins not in the B‑WICH complex.
  The ERCC6 (CSB) component of B‑WICH and MYOIC interact with KAT2B (PCAF) (Sarshad
  et al. 2013, Shen et al. 2013). The histone acetyltransferases are believed to acetylate
  histone H3 at lysine‑9 in rDNA since this modification is reduced in WSTF and MYOIC
  knockdown cells (Vintermist et al. 2011, Sarshad et al. 2013). Knockdown of KAT2B
  causes loss of acetylation on histone H4 and on histone H3 at lysine‑9 (Shen et
  al. 2013).
