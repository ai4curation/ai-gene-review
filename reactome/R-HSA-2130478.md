display_name: Interaction of invariant chain trimer and MHC II alpha beta dimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MHC II alpha beta dimers associate with a third polypeptide, the invariant
  chain (Ii), required for class II molecules to reach the endocytic pathway (Roche
  et al. 1991). The interaction of Ii with the MHC II alpha beta dimer serves multiple
  functions. It plays a role in assembly, folding, egress from the ER and transport
  through the Golgi. Ii exists as a trimer; residues 163-183 of the Ii lumenal domain
  are involved in covalent cross-linking. Residues 96-104 are critical for association
  with class II alpha beta dimers (Bijlmakers et al. 1994, Freisewinkel et al. 1993).
  Residues 89-104 known as CLIP (Class II-associated invariant chain peptide) are
  the part of the Ii chain that binds antigen binding MHC class II groove, remaining
  bound until the MHC receptor is completely assembled. This CLIP domain prevents
  the premature binding of self-peptide fragments present in ER prior to MHC II localization
  within the endosomal compartment. The ER-resident chaperone protein calnexin rapidly
  associates with newly synthesized alpha, beta and invariant chains, and remains
  associated until the final nonamer assembly. The stoichiometry of calnexin in this
  interaction and the dynamics of association-dissociation are not known. Calnexin
  may stabilize the free class II chains and regulate their intracellular transport
  by facilitating the production of transport competent molecules out of the ER (Anderson
  & Cresswell 1994, Schreiber et al. 1995).

## Summary
