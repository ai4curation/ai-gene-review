species: Homo sapiens
summary: Under the basal resting conditions, cytosolic Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  NFE2L2 (NRF2) is maintained at low basal levels by constitutive proteasomal degradation.
  Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which is a substrate adaptor protein
  for the Cullin 3 (CUL3)-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex binds with and represses
  NFE2L2 by promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Itoh
  et al. 1999, Cullinan et al. 2004, Kobayashi et al. 2004, Zhang et al. 2004, Furukawa
  & Xiong 2005). Therefore, the KEAP1–CUL3–E3 ubiquitin ligase complex tightly regulates
  NFE2L2 protein to maintain it at a low level. NFE2L2 contains seven functional domains,
  known as Neh1-Neh7. Neh2 domain contains two motifs termed ETGE and DLG that are
  involved in interacting with KEAP1. The ETGE and the DLG motifs have overlapping
  binding sites on KEAP1, with the ETGE motif mediating a higher affinity interaction
  with KEAP1 than the DLG motif. One molecule of NFE2L2 interacts simultaneously with
  two KEAP1 molecules, with the DLG motif and the ETGE motif on NFE2L2 contacting
  similar sites on each member of the KEAP1 dimer (Tong et al, 2006; McMahon et al,
  2006; Baird et al, 2013; Fukutomi et al, 2014). This complex assembly positions
  NFE2L2 appropriately to be ubiquitinated by the CUL3/RBX1 ubiquitin ligase, targeting
  it for degradation. In the presence of electrophiles or other NFE2L2 inducers, conformational
  changes within KEAP1 occur as inducers interact with KEAP1 'sensor cysteines'. These
  conformational changes disrupt the KEAP1-DLG motif interaction, repositioning NFE2L2
  within the KEAP1 complex in such a way as to prevent its ubiquitination. In this
  'hinge and latch model', saturation of the KEAP1:CUL3:RBX1 complex with mal-positioned
  and thus not degradable NFE2L2 allows newly translated NFE2L2 to accumulate and
  translocate into the nucleus to stimulate transcription (Tong et al, 2006; Tong
  et al, 2007; reviewed in Baird and Yamamoto, 2020). This NFE2L2-KEAP1 interaction
  is also known to be regulated negatively by multiple proteins like PALB2, DPP3 and
  AMER(WTX1) which competitively bind with NFE2L2/KEAP1 and allow NFE2L2 nuclear translocation.
  They play an important role in NFE2L2 regulation to other pathways (Mizukami et
  al, 2012;  Lu et al, 2017; Camp et al, 2012). In addition to that, this NFE2L2-KEAP1
  binding is also regulated by succinylation of KEAP1 as cysteine residue and inhibits
  KEAP1 binding with NRF2 in FH mutant (LOF) condition (Ooi et al, 2011). <br>KEAP1
  and NFE2L2 mutations occur in several tumor types and KEAP1 and NFE2L2 mutations
  occur at a frequency of around 25% in lung cancer. The NFE2L2 pathway has multiple
  pro-tumorigenic functions, and NFE2L2 levels are increased in head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma (HNSCC). KEAP1 somatic mutant C23Y is observed in tumors from approximately
  15% of patients with lung cancer (Hayes & McMahon 2009).

## Summary

Under the basal resting conditions, cytosolic Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related NFE2L2 (NRF2) is maintained at low basal levels by constitutive proteasomal degradation. Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which is a substrate adaptor protein for the Cullin 3 (CUL3)-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex binds with and represses NFE2L2 by promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Itoh et al. 1999, Cullinan et al. 2004, Kobayashi et al. 2004, Zhang et al. 2004, Furukawa & Xiong 2005). Therefore, the KEAP1–CUL3–E3 ubiquitin ligase complex tightly regulates NFE2L2 protein to maintain it at a low level. NFE2L2 contains seven functional domains, known as Neh1-Neh7. Neh2 domain contains two motifs termed ETGE and DLG that are involved in interacting with KEAP1. The ETGE and the DLG motifs have overlapping binding sites on KEAP1, with the ETGE motif mediating a higher affinity interaction with KEAP1 than the DLG motif.
