display_name: dolichyl phosphate + GDP-alpha-D-mannose -> dolichyl phosphate D-mannose
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cytosolic GDP-mannose reacts with dolichyl phosphate in the endoplasmic reticulum
  membrane to form dolichyl phosphate D-mannose (DOLPman). The reaction is catalysed
  by dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase, a heterotrimeric protein embedded in
  the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The first subunit of the heterotrimer (DPM1)
  appears to be the actual catalyst, and the other two subunits appear to stabilise
  it (Maeda et al. 2000).
