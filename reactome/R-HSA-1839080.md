display_name: Activated cytosolic FGFR1 fusions bind PIK3CA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activation of the PI3K pathway has been demonstrated in the case of ZMYM2-FGFR1
  (Chen, 2004), BCR-FGFR1 (Demiroglu, 2001) and FOP-FGFR1 (Guasch, 2001), and is presumed
  to occur to a greater or lesser extent in other FGFR1 fusions as well (reviewed
  in Jackson, 2010).  Activation of the PI3K pathway suggests that the PIK3CA catalytic
  subunit must be recruited to the fusion protein.
