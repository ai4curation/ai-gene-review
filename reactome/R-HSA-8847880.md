display_name: CYTH proteins bind ARF1:GTP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cytohesin (CYTH) proteins 1, 2, 3 and 4 are ARF guanine nucleotide exchange
  factors (GEFs) for ARF1 as well as other ARFs. Recruitment to the membrane is mediated
  by direct interaction with ARF1:GTP as well as an interaction between the CYTH plexstrin
  homology (PH) domain and the lipid membrane (Chardin et al, 1996; Betz et al, 1998;
  Mossessova et al, 1998; Cherfils et al, 1998; Franco et al, 1998; Osagawara et al,
  2000; Malaby et al, 2013).
