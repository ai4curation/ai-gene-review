## Summary

Later ZAP-70 undergoes trans-autophosphorylation at Y315 and Y319. These sites appear to be positive regulatory sites. ZAP-70 achieve its full activation after the trans-autophosphorylation. Activated ZAP-70 phosphorylates T-cell-specific adaptors, such as LAT and SLP-76 leading to the recruitment and activation of other kinase families and enzymes, resulting in secondary messenger generation and culminating in T cell activation.
