display_name: Displacement of TDG glycosylase by APEX1 at the AP site
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'APEX1 (APE1, HAP1), a DNA apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site lyase, displaces
  TDG from the AP site created by the DNA glycosylase activity of TDG. In the absence
  of APEX1, TDG remains tightly bound to the AP site, which inhibits subsequent steps
  in the base excision repair. Sumoylation of TDG may also be involved in the APEX1-mediated
  displacement of TDG from AP sites (Hardeland et al. 2002, Steinacher and Schar 2005,
  Fitzgerald and Drohat 2008). '

## Summary

APEX1 (APE1, HAP1), a DNA apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site lyase, displaces TDG from the AP site created by the DNA glycosylase activity of TDG. In the absence of APEX1, TDG remains tightly bound to the AP site, which inhibits subsequent steps in the base excision repair. Sumoylation of TDG may also be involved in the APEX1-mediated displacement of TDG from AP sites (Hardeland et al. 2002, Steinacher and Schar 2005, Fitzgerald and Drohat 2008).
