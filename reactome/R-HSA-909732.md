display_name: Phosphorylation of STAT2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT2 recruited to the IFNAR1 subunit then becomes tyrosine phosphorylated
  on residue 690 by TYK2 kinase. This phosphotyrosine provides a docking site for
  recruitment of STAT1 to IFNAR1, which is then tyrosine phosphorylated and activated.
