display_name: VEGFA dimer:p-6Y-VEGFR2 dimer:PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PI3-kinase (PI3K) catalyzes the phosphorylation of inositol phospholipids
  at the 3 position to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol
  3,4-bisphosphate. PIP2 and PIP3 generated serve as lipid substrates where they recruit
  guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) like VAV (Proto-oncogene vav) that catalyze
  the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac, activating it (Han et al. 1998). VAV2 acts downstream
  of VEGF to activate Rac1 (Garretta et al. 2007).
