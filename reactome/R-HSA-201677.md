display_name: Phosphorylation of LRP5/6 cytoplasmic domain by membrane-associated
  GSK3beta
species: Homo sapiens
summary: LRP5/6 contains 5 PPP(S/T)PxS motifs in its intracellular domain which have
  been shown to be phosphorylated by a membrane-associated pool of GSK3beta. Individual
  phosphorylation of each of these motifs promotes interaction with AXIN and stimulates
  WNT signaling as assessed by activation of a TCF/beta-catenin responsive reporter
  (Tamai et al, 2004; Zeng et al, 2005; MacDonald et al, 2008).  In the context of
  full length LRP6, phosphorylation of the five motifs shows cooperative stimulation
  of AXIN binding and WNT signaling.  GSK3beta-mediated phosphorylation of LRP6 is
  thought to prime the receptor for subsequent phosphorylation by CSNK1 (Zeng et al,
  2005; reviewed in He et al, 2004).
