stable_id: R-HSA-6814088
display_name: SYS1 binds AcM-ARFRP1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Acetylation of the N-terminal methionine of ARFRP1 contributes to its interaction
  with the Golgi-localized membrane protein SYS1.  ARFRP1 is part of an ARF cascade
  at the late or trans-Golgi, where it plays a role in retrograde traffic by recruiting
  ARL1, which in turn interacts with a number of Golgin tethering factors required
  for vesicle docking at the TGN (Behnia et al, 2004; Setty et al, 2004; Shin et al,
  2005; reviewed in Bonifacino and Rojas, 2006; Munro, 2011).
