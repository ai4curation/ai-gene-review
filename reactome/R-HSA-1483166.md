summary: In the de novo synthesis of phosphatidic acid (PA), lysophosphatidic acid
  (LPA) is initially formed by the esterification of sn-1 by glycerol 3-phosphate
  acyltransferase (GPAT) from glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P). Next, LPA is converted to
  PA by a LPA acyltransferase (AGPAT, also known as LPAAT).  In addition to this,
  PA is also formed when phosphatidylcholine (PC) is hydrolyzed by phospholipases
  D1 and D2 (PLD1 and 2).  PA is involved in acyl chain remodeling via cleavage by
  phospholipases followed by reacylation by acyltransferases (Ghomashchi et al. 2010,
  Singer et al. 2002, Prasad et al. 2011, Shindou & Shimizu 2009, Cao et al. 2006).
