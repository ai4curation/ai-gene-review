display_name: Frataxin transfers Fe2+ to ACO2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Frataxin (FXN) is an iron chaperone that acts as a protein partner of ACO2
  not only during Fe–S maturation but also during the repairing of inactivated [3Fe–4S]+-ACO2.
  It donates one Fe atom to reactivate ACO2 with a full [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster (Bulteau
  et al., 2004; Mansilla et al., 2023). Mutations in FXN can lead to Friedreich ataxia
  (FXAD, MIM:229300; see e.g. Cossee et al., 1999).
