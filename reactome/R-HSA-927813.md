display_name: p-4S-UPF1 recruits SMG5, SMG7, SMG6, PNRC2, DCP1A, and PP2A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SMG6, SMG5 and SMG7 contain 14-3-3 domains which are believed to bind phosphorylated
  SQ motifs in UPF1 (Chiu et al. 2003, Ohnishi et al. 2003, Unterholzner and Izaurralde
  2004,  Fukuhara et al. 2005, Durand et al. 2007). SMG7 has been shown to bind UPF1
  directly, target UPF1 for dephosphorylation by PP2A, and recruit enzymes that degrade
  RNA (Ohnishi et al. 2003, Unterholzner and Izaurralde 2004, Fukuhara et al. 2005).
  UPF3AS (the small isoform of UPF3A) also associates with the complex (Ohnishi et
  al. 2003). SMG6 is an endoribonuclease that cleaves the mRNA bound by UPF1 and also
  recruits phosphatase PP2A to dephosphorylate UPF1 (Chiu et al. 2003, Glavan et al.
  2006, Eberle et al. 2009). PNRC2 binds both phospo-UPF1 and the decapping enzyme
  DCP1A, thereby facilitating decapping of the mRNA (Cho et al. 2009, Lai et al. 2012,
  Cho et al. 2013).<br>Though immunofluorescence in vivo indicates that SMG5 and SMG7
  exist in separate complexes from SMG6 (Unterholzner and Izaurralde 2004) immunoprecipitation
  shows that SMG6 is present in complexes that also contain SMG5, SMG7, UPF1, UPF2,
  Y14, Magoh, and PABP (Kashima et al. 2010). SMG5, SMG6, and SMG7 are therefore represented
  here together in the same RNP complex. It is possible that some complexes contain
  only SMG6 or SMG5:SMG7 (reviewed in Nicholson et al. 2010, Muhlemann and Lykke-Andersen
  2010). Note that "Smg5/7a" in Chiu et al. 2003 actually refers to SMG6.<br>Phosphorylated

## Summary

SMG6, SMG5 and SMG7 contain 14-3-3 domains which are believed to bind phosphorylated SQ motifs in UPF1 (Chiu et al. 2003, Ohnishi et al. 2003, Unterholzner and Izaurralde 2004,  Fukuhara et al. 2005, Durand et al. 2007).
