species: Homo sapiens
summary: EGR2 (also known as KROX20) is a member of the Early Growth Response (EGR)
  gene family encoding sequence-specific Cys2-His2 DNA binding transcription factors.  The
  EGR family are immediate early genes (IEGs) whose expression is rapidly upregulated
  in response to a number of external stimuli to control activation of genes involved
  in stress response and differentiation (reviewed in Pagel and Deindl, 2001; Bahrami
  and Drabløs, 2016). Roles for EGR proteins are well established in the nervous system,
  with EGR target genes contributing to synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation,
  peripheral nerve myelination and NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (reviewed in Perez-Cadahia
  et al, 2011; Herdegen and Leah, 1998; O'Donovan et al, 1999)<br>  In addition to
  its other roles, EGR2 is a critical regulator of myelination by Schwann cells in
  the peripheral nervous system (reviewed in Svaren and Meijer, 2008). Consistent
  with this, Schwann cells are blocked at the promyelinating stage in EGR2 knockouts
  in mice (Topilko et al, 1994). Expression of EGR2 during the myelination process
  is controlled by a myelinating Schwann cell enhancer (MSE) 35 kb downstream of the
  gene (Ghislain et al, 2002). The MSE is bound by SOX10, POU3F1 and POU3F2 (Ghislain
  and Charnay, 2006; Reiprich et al, 2010). SOX10 in turn recruits SMARCA4, HDAC1
  and HDAC2 to play overlapping but non-redundant roles in activating EGR2 expression
  (Jacob et al, 2011; Chen et al, 2011; Weider et al, 2012).
