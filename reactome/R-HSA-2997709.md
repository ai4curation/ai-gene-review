stable_id: R-HSA-2997709
display_name: PIAS1,4 SUMOylates BRCA1 with SUMO1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PIAS1,4 SUMOylate BRCA1 with SUMO1 at lysine-109 (Morris et al. 2009, Xu
  et al. 2009). SUMOylation occurs in response to genotoxic stress and double-strand
  breaks to which PIAS1 and PIAS4 are recruited (Galanty et al. 2009). SUMOylation
  enhances the ability of BRCA1 to bind and modulate ESR1 (ERalpha) transcriptional
  activity (Xu et al. 2009). More SUMO2:BRCA1 than SUMO1:BRCA1 is observed in vivo
  (Morris et al. 2009, Galanty et al. 2009).

## Summary

PIAS1,4 SUMOylate BRCA1 with SUMO1 at lysine-109 (Morris et al. 2009, Xu et al. 2009). SUMOylation occurs in response to genotoxic stress and double-strand breaks to which PIAS1 and PIAS4 are recruited (Galanty et al. 2009). SUMOylation enhances the ability of BRCA1 to bind and modulate ESR1 (ERalpha) transcriptional activity (Xu et al. 2009). More SUMO2:BRCA1 than SUMO1:BRCA1 is observed in vivo (Morris et al. 2009, Galanty et al. 2009).
