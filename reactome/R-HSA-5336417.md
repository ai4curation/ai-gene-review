display_name: DT A:B binds HBEGF and CD9 on the target cell surface
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Diphtheria toxin fragments A and B, linked by a disulfide bond (DT A:B) (Collier
  and Kandel 1971; DeLange et al. 1979; Lambotte et al. 1980; Michel et al. 1972)
  bind to molecules of proheparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF) and CD9 antigen
  on the target cell plasma membrane. While binding to HBEGF is sufficient for DT
  A:B uptake into a target cell, presence of CD9 on the target cell surface substantially
  increases its sensitivity to DT and cross-linking and immunopreciptitation studies
  indicate that DT A:B, HBEGF, and CD9 form a complex on the cell surface (Brown et
  al. 1993; Iwamoto et al. 1994). The organization and order of assembly of the complex
  are not known.
