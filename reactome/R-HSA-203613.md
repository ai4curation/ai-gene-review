  of eNOS by acyl protein thioesterase 1, which displaces eNOS from the membrane.  This
  might be a mechanism to downregulate NO production following intense stimuli.

**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

Increases in intracellular calcium and calmodulin stimulate depalmitoylation of eNOS by acyl protein thioesterase 1, which displaces eNOS from the membrane.  This might be a mechanism to downregulate NO production following intense stimuli.
