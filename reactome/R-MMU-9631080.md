species: Mus musculus
summary: In addition to bulk protein degradation, Microautophagy (MI) can also target
  KFERQ motif protein substrates similar to Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA). However,
  MI is distinct from CMA in that it occurs during late endosomes/multivesicular bodies
  formation. Upon binding with Hspa8, substrates are transported from the cytosol
  to late endosomes. Hspa8 binds with the phospholipids on the late endosomal membrane.
  Subsequently, the substrate is transported into the lumen via endosomal sorting
  complexes required for transport (ESCRTI and ESCRTIII systems) (Sahu R et al. 2011).
  This event is represented as a black box since the precise molecular mechanism of
  the substrate transport into the endosomal lumen is unclear.
