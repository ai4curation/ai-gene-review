summary: Surfactant catabolism by alveolar macrophages plays a small but critical
  part in surfactant recycling and metabolism. Upon ligand binding, granulocyte-macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSF), a heterodimer of alpha (CSF2RA) and
  beta (CSF2RB) subunits, initiates a signalling process that not only induces proliferation,
  differentiation and functional activation of hematopoietic cells but can also determine
  surfactant uptake into alveolar macrophages and its degradation via clathrin-coated
  vesicles. Defects in human CSF2RB can cause pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction
  5 (SMDP5; MIM:614370, aka pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 5, PAP5), a rare lung disorder
  due to impaired surfactant homeostasis characterised by alveoli filling with floccular
  material causing respiratory failure. Mutations in CSF2RB that cause SMDP5 are R211Efs*54
  and S271L (Tanaka et al. 2011, Suzuki et al. 2011).
