stable_id: R-HSA-6788867
display_name: FN3K phosphorylates ketosamines
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Proteins can undergo chemical modifications such as glycation, which occurs
  when glucose and other free aldoses spontaneously react with N-terminal and eta-amino
  groups of proteins to form Schiff bases, which slowly rearrange to ketosamines or,
  if the sugar is glucose, fructosamines. Fructosamines can further react slowly and
  become advanced glycation end products, which are thought to play a role in the
  pathophysiology of several disorders, especially diabetic complications. Ketosamine-3-kinase
  (FN3K) and ketosamine-3-kinase-related protein (FN3KRP) can phosphorylate protein-bound
  or free ketosamines on the third carbon of the sugar moiety and the resultant, unstable
  ketosamine 3-phosphates decompose under physiological conditions (a process called
  deglycation). Both enzymes can 3-phosphorylate psicosamines (PsiAm) and ribulosamines
  (RibAm), but only FN3K can 3-phosphorylate fructosamines (FruAm) as well (Delpierre
  et al. 2000, 2004).
