display_name: APC truncation mutants have impaired AXIN binding
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The tumor suppressor APC is a central component of the destruction complex
  that makes direct, functionally important contacts with a number of other destruction
  complex members, including AXIN, beta-catenin and GSK3 (Behrens et al, 1998; Kishida
  et al, 1998; Hart et al, 1998; Rubinfeld et al, 1993; Su et al, 1993; Rubinfeld
  et al, 1996).  These protein-protein interactions are critical to APC's role in
  promoting the proteasome-mediated degradation of beta-catenin, and are abrogated
  by APC truncations that are common in the vast majority of colorectal cancers (reviewed
  in Saito-Diaz et al, 2013; Polakis, 2000; Polakis, 2012).  Cancer cells with expressing
  truncated forms of APC have high levels of free beta-catenin and aberrant WNT target
  gene expression (Morin et al, 1997; Shih et al, 2000; Roh et al, 2001).<br>
