display_name: ARHGAP35 binds RASA1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PTK6 (BRK) mediated phosphorylation of ARHGAP35 (p190 Rho GAP) promotes binding
  of ARHGAP35 to RASA1 (p120 RAS GAP). Binding to ARHGAP35 inhibits RASA1-mediated
  stimulation of RAS GTPase activity, resulting in prolonged RAS signaling (Shen et
  al. 2008).
