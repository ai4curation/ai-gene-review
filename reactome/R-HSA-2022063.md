display_name: CHST14 transfers SO4(2-) to GalNAc in dermatan or DS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Important functional domains in dermatan or dermatan sulfate (DS) are generated
  by the action of an epimerase (which converts D-glucuronic acid into its epimer
  L-iduronic acid) together with 4-O-sulfation. These domains are named 4-O-sulfated
  iduronic acid blocks (Pachebo et al. 2009). Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 14 (CHST14)
  (Evers et al. 2001) mediates the transfer of sulfate to position 4 of another N-acetylgalactosamine
  (GalNAc) residue of D2,4(S)2-PG (sulfated on position 2 of IdoA and position 4 of
  GalNAc) to produce a further sulfated product D2,4,4(S)3-PG (sulfated on another
  GalNAc in addition to the ones above). Mutations in CHST14 can cause a form of Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome (EDSMC1, MIM:601776; Miyake et al., 2010).
