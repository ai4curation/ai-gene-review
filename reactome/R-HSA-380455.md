display_name: Recruitment of CDK11p58 to the centrosomes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CDK11p58 is a kinase that is active during mitosis when it associates with
  centrosomes, and has a crucial role in centrosome maturation and bipolar spindle
  formation (Petretti et al., 2006). CDK11p58 facilitates microtubule nucleation and
  is required for the recruitment of Aurora and Plk1 to the centrosome (Petretti et
  al., 2006).
