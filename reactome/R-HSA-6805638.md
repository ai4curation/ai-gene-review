stable_id: R-HSA-6805638
display_name: KAT6A acetylates TP53
species: Homo sapiens
summary: KAT6A histone acetyltransferase, part of the MOZ/MORF complex, acetylates
  TP53 (p53) on lysine residues K120 and K382. The acetylation of TP53 by KAT6A is
  enhanced in the presence of PML and results in increased transcriptional activation
  of the CDKN1A (p21) gene by TP53 (Rokudai et al. 2013).
