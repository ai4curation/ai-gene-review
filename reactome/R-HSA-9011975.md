display_name: Estrogen-responsive MYC gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MYC gene expression is estrogen-responsive and expression of MYC and CCND1
  contribute to the proliferative response stimulated by estrogen treatment (Dubnik
  et al, 1987; Dubnik et al, 1988; Dubnik and Shu, 1992; Prall et al, 1998). Estrogen-responsive
  MYC expression appears to depend at least in part on a distal enhancer element 67
  kb from the transcriptional start site that contains a half ERE and an AP-1 site
  (Denardo et al, 2005; Carroll et al, 2006; Wang et al, 2011). Upon estrogen stimulation,
  these sites are occupied by ESR1 and a JUND:FOSB heterodimer, respectively (Wang
  et al, 2011). Estrogen-responsive MYC expression also depends on the cohesin complex,
  as depletion of the RAD21 cohesin subunit abrogates expression (Stedman et al, 2008;
  Schmidt et al, 2010; McEwan et al, 2011; Antony et al, 2015). Genome-wide studies
  have shown that RAD21 and ESR1 binding sites overlap in a fraction of estrogen-responsive
  genes, including MYC (Schmidt et al, 2010). Cohesin may contribute to target gene
  expression by promoting chromatin looping structures between distal enhancers and
  the target gene promoters or through other mechanisms that remain to be elucidated
  (Li et al, 2012; Antony et al, 2015; reviewed Rhodes et al, 2011; Losada, 2014).
  Overexpression of histone isoform HIST1H2AC in breast cancer has been shown to contribute
  to MYC gene expression by promoting the formation of activating chromatin loops
  and facilitating the recruitment of ESR1, EP300 and RNA polymerase II (Su et al,
  2014).
