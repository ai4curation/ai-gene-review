display_name: MYC mRNA translation is negatively regulated by miR-34B and C
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Translation of MYC mRNA is negatively regulated by miR-34B and C microRNAs
  (Kress et al, 2011).  miR-34 miRNAs bind and cause degradation of MYC mRNA, resulting
  in decreased level of MYC protein product (reviewed in Myant and Sansom, 2011; Kostenko
  et al, 2012).

## Summary

Translation of MYC mRNA is negatively regulated by miR-34B and C microRNAs (Kress et al, 2011).  miR-34 miRNAs bind and cause degradation of MYC mRNA, resulting in decreased level of MYC protein product (reviewed in Myant and Sansom, 2011; Kostenko et al, 2012).
