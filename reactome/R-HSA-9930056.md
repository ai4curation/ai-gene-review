display_name: The NEXT complex and ZC3H18 bind CBCA:m7GpppN-RNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The CBCA complex (CBP80:CBP20:ARS2, also called NCBP1:NCBP2:SRRT) is bound
  to the m7GpppN cap of an RNA. ZC3H18 interacts with the SRRT (ARS2) subunit of the
  CBCA complex (Winczura et al. 2018, Polák et al. 2023) and the NEXT complex (RBM7:ZCCHC8:MTREX)
  (Lubas et al. 2011, Winczura et al. 2018) to form the CBCN complex (Andersen et
  al. 2013). The NEXT complex binds lower amounts of RNA exosome components than CBCA
  components suggesting that some portion of the CBCN complex is not bound to the
  RNA exosome (Andersen et al. 2013).<br>The NEXT complex binds ZC3H18 as a homodimer
  and all subunits of the NEXT complex participate in interaction with RNA (Puno and
  Lima 2022, Gerlach et al. 2022). Substrate RNAs of NEXT are generally not polyadenylated,
  do not have polyadenylation sequences (Wu et al. 2020), and include promoter upstream
  transcripts (PROMPTS) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) (Lubas et al. 2015). ZC3H18 is believed
  to initiate degradation of RNAs that are produced from paused transcripts released
  from transcription complexes by the endonucleolytic activity of the Integrator complex
  (reviewed in Rambout and Maquat 2024). ZC3H18, which interacts with the NEXT complex,
  and ZC3H1, which interacts with the PAXT connection, compete for binding to the
  same site on SRRT (ARS2) (Polák et al. 2023). The PAXT connection may thus compete
  with the NEXT complex for substrate RNAs and may act as a fail-safe system for RNAs
  that escape targeting by NEXT (Wu et al. 2020)
