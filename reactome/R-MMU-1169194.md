stable_id: R-MMU-1169194
display_name: Socs binding to JAK2
species: Mus musculus
summary: Socs1 can bind JAK2 and inhibit JAK kinase activity (Yasukawa et al. 1999).
  Socs3 also inhibits JAK2 kinase activity (Sasaki et al. 1999) while all of SOCS1
  -3 and CIS inhibit GHR signaling (Ram & Waxman 1999, Nicholson et al. 2000). This
  is not thought to be simply the outcome of binding competition between SOCS and
  STAT5, but a direct action of SOCS on JAK2 (Ram & Waxman 1999). Although SOCS are
  known to be ubiquitin ligases (Kamura et al. 2004) ubiquitin ligase activity on
  JAK2 or GHR has not been demonstrated, and a role for SOCS in the ubiquitination
  of these proteins has been questioned (Flores-Morales et al. 2006). An alternative
  model suggested by the observation that SOCS3  strongly inhibits JAK2 only in the
  presence of GHR proposes that SOCS serve as an inhibitory 'bridge' by binding simultaneously
  to GHR and JAK2 (Ram & Waxman 1999).

## Summary
