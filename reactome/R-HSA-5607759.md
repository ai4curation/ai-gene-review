display_name: TRIKA2 binds K63polyUb-TRAF6 oligomer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: K-63 linked polyubiquitin (pUb) chain on TRAF6 provides a scaffold to recruit
  downstream effector molecules to activate NF-kB. Transforming growth factor beta-associated
  kinase 1 (TAK1) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase
  kinase family that is shown to be an essential intermediate that transmits the upstream
  signals from the receptor complex to the downstream MAPKs and to the NF-kB pathway
  (Broglie et al. 2009). As a member of the MAP3K family, TAK1 is unique in that its
  activity requires its binding proteins TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1), TAB2 and TAB3.
  TAB1 acts as the kinase subunit of the TAK1 complex, aiding in the autophosphorylation
  of TAK1, whereas TAB2 and its homologue TAB3, acts as an adaptor of TAK1 that facilitate
  the assembly of TAK1 complex to TRAF6 (Takaesu et al. 2000, Ishitani et al. 2003).
  This protein kinase complex containing the kinase subunit TAK1 and the regulatory
  subunits TAB1 and TAB2/TAB3 is also known as TRIKA2 (TRAF6-regulated IKK activator
  2) (Adhikari et al. 2007).
