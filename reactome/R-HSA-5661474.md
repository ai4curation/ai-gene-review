display_name: Defective NPC does not transport GCK1:GKRP from cytosol to nucleoplasm
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The nuclear pore complex (NPC) trafficks cargo across the nuclear membrane.
  Nucleoprotein TPR functions as a scaffolding element in the nuclear phase of the
  NPC essential for normal nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins and mRNAs. The
  complex glucokinase (GCK1) and glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) can be translocated
  to the nucleus via the NPC. Defects in TPR may confer susceptibility towards thyroid
  papillary carcinona (TPC; MIM:18850), a common tumor of the thyroid that typically
  arises as an irregular, solid or cystic mass from otherwise normal thyroid tissue.
  Mutations in TPR that can confer susceptibility to TPC are L458P and M489P (Hase
  et al. 2001, Hase & Cordes 2003).
