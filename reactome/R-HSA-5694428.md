display_name: LMAN family proteins bind glycosylated cargo
species: Homo sapiens
summary: LMAN1, also known as ERGIC-53, is a transmembrane receptor that binds to
  high-mannose containing soluble glycoproteins in the ER and helps package them into
  COPII vesicles for trafficking to the ERGIC and Golgi.  Identified cargo include
  SERPINA (alpha1-antitrypsin) and the cathepsins CTSC and CTSZ, among others (Nyefeler
  et al, 2008; Appenzeller et al, 1999; reviewed in Hauri et al, 2000; Szul and Sztul,
  2011). LMAN1 itself is concentrated into COPII vesicles through interaction with
  components of the COPII coat (Kappeler et al, 1997; reviewed in Dancourt and Barlowe,
  2010). Other LMAN family proteins, which include LMANL1, LMAN2 and LMAN2L, also
  bind glycosylated ER cargo proteins, although the lectin specificities vary (Kamiya
  et al, 2005; Kamiya et al, 2007; Reiterer et al, 2010; reviewed in Dancourt and
  Barlowe, 2010).
