summary: Carbon dioxide (CO2) in plasma is hydrated to yield protons (H+) and bicarbonate
  (HCO3-) by carbonic anhydrase IV (CA4) located on the apical plasma membranes of
  endothelial cells. Plasma CO2 is also taken up by erythrocytes via AQP1 and RhAG.
  Within erythrocytes CA1 and, predominantly, CA2 hydrate CO2 to HCO3- and protons
  (reviewed in Geers & Gros 2000, Jensen 2004, Boron 2010). The HCO3- is transferred
  out of the erythrocyte by the band 3 anion exchange protein (AE1, SLC4A1) which
  cotransports a chloride ion (Cl-) into the erythrocyte.<br>Also within the erythrocyte,
  CO2 combines with the N-terminal alpha amino groups of HbA to form carbamates while
  protons bind histidine residues in HbA. The net result is the Bohr effect, a conformational
  change in HbA that reduces its affinity for O2 and hence assists the delivery of
  O2 to tissues.
