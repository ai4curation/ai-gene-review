stable_id: R-HSA-418163
display_name: Activated SRC-1 activates MAPKs (in F2R:ARRB1:MAPKs:active SRC-1)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Within the beta-arrestin-1:Src:ERK complex, activated Src phosphorylates
  and activates ERK. ERK activation requires dual Thr and Tyr phosphorylations, at
  Thr202/Tyr204 for human ERK1 and Thr185/Tyr187 for human ERK2. Significant ERK activation
  requires phosphorylation at both sites, with Tyr phosphorylation preceding that
  of Thr. This reaction is given as a black-box event because the phosphorylation
  state of ERK on binding to beta-arrestin-1 is unknown.
