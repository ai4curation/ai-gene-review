stable_id: R-HSA-5655268
display_name: Activated FGFR2 mutants phosphorylate FRS2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After recruitment to activated FGFR mutants, FRS2 is believed to be phosphorylated,
  potentially on all 6 of the tyrosines phosphorylated by wild-type FGFRs.  Phosphorylation
  of FRS2 by FGFR has been demonstrated in some cases (see for instance Qing, 2009;
  Bai, 2010; Ahmed, 2008; Raffioni, 1998) and is inferred to occur in others based
  on activation of downstream signaling modules (reviewed in Wesche, 2011; Turner
  and Grose, 2010).
