stable_id: R-HSA-9837034
display_name: SLIRP:LRPPRC binds mitochondrial RNAs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The SLIRP:LRPPRC complex (Sasarman et al. 2010, inferred from mouse homologs
  in Ruzzenente et al. 2012) binds throughout the mitochondrial transcriptome (Siira
  et al. 2017) including 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, 13 mRNAs, and 5 precursor RNAs, and inhibits
  their degradation (Sasarman et al. 2010, Chujo et al. 2012, Siira et al. 2017).
  SLIRP:LRPPRC reduces secondary structure of RNAs and may act to expose sites for
  translation, stabilization, and polyadenylation (Siira et al. 2017). Mutations in
  LRPPRC cause French Canadian Leigh Syndrome which is characterized by neurodegeneration
  caused by a deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase (Sasarman et al. 2010).
