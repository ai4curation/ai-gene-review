display_name: Production of phagocyte oxygen radicals by NOX2 complex bound to RAC2:GTP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'RAC2:GTP-bound NOX2 complex, consisting of CYBB (NOX2), CYBA (p22phox),
  NCF1 (p47phox), NCF2 (p67phox) and NCF4 (p40phox), acts as an NADPH oxidase to produce
  superoxide anion O2- in phagosomes of neutorphils, enabling microbicidal activity
  of neutrophils (Knaus et al. 1991, Kim et al. 2001, Kao et al. 2008, Anderson et
  al. 2010, Jyoti et al. 2014). Rac2 knockout mice have dramatically reduced NADPH
  oxidase activity (Roberts et al. 1999). Phosphorylation of NOX2 complex components
  NCF1 (el Benna et al. 1994), NCF2 (Zhao et al. 2005) and NCF4 (Bouin et al. 1998)
  contributes to the activation of the phagosomal NADPH oxidase. '
