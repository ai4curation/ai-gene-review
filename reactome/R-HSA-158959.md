display_name: urokinase plasminogen activator + urokinase plasminogen activator receptor
  (uPAR) -> urokinase plasminogen activator:uPAR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The uncleaved (one-chain) form of urokinase plasminogen activator associates
  with urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), forming a complex at the cell
  surface (Cubellis et al. 1986). The complex is anchored to the outer face of the
  plasma membrane by a glycophosphatidylinositol moiety at the carboxy terminus of
  uPAR (Behrendt et al. 1990; Ploug et al. 1991).
