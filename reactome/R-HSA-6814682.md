species: Homo sapiens
summary: After capture at the trans-Golgi network by SNAREs and tethering factors,
  early endosome-derived vesicles undergo membrane fusion, delivering cargo and the
  cis-SNARE complex to the TGN membrane.  The details of this fusion event are not
  fully established (reviewed in Pfeffer, 2011).

## Summary

After capture at the trans-Golgi network by SNAREs and tethering factors, early endosome-derived vesicles undergo membrane fusion, delivering cargo and the cis-SNARE complex to the TGN membrane.  The details of this fusion event are not fully established (reviewed in Pfeffer, 2011).
