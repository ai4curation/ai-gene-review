stable_id: R-HSA-5218812
display_name: FYN phosphorylates PAK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PAK2 activity via GTPases can be strongly potentiated by concurrent stimulation
  of cellular tyrosine kinase activity. FYN may be involved in this potentiation by
  phosphorylating Y130 in the N-terminal regulatory domain leading to a robust enhancement
  of the catalytic activity of PAK2 (Renkema et al. 2002).
