display_name: MRRF binds 55S ribosome:mRNA:tRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The mitochondrial ribosome releasing factor MRRF (RRF) binds the 55S ribosome
  at the A-site after translation has been terminated by MTRF1L (MTRF1a) at a stop
  codon and the translated polypeptide has been hydrolyzed from the last tRNA, which
  remains in the P-site (Rorbach et al. 2008).
