display_name: SHC1 phosphorylation by ERBB2 heterodimers
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once bound to ERBB2 heterodimers, SHC1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues
  by the tyrosine kinase activity of either ERBB2 or its heterodimerization partners
  EGFR and ERBB4 (Segatto et al. 1993, Soler et al. 1994).
