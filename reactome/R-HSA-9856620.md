display_name: p-S167-ESR1 activates expression of HTRA2 (OMI)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In response to unfolded protein in the mitochondrial matrix, AKT1 (PKB1)
  is phosphorylated by an unknown mechanism (Papa and Germain 2011) and then phosphorylates
  the estrogen receptor ESR1 (Campbell et al. 2001, Papa and Germain 2011), which
  transits to the nucleus and activates expression of HTRA2 (OMI), a serine protease
  involved in mitochondrial protein degradation (Papa and Germain 2011) independently
  of estrogen (Campbell et al. 2001).
