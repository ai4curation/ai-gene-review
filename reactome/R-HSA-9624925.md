display_name: miR-33 binds to the 3'UTR of the ABCA1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a target of micro RNA 33 (miR-33)
  (Rayner KJ et al. 2010; Marquart TJ et al. 2010; Najafi-Shoushtari SH et al.2010;
  Horie T et al. 2010; Zaiou M et al. 2018). The miR33 family consists of two intronic
  miRNAs, miR-33a and miR-33b, which are encoded within the introns of the sterol
  regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) 2 and 1 genes, respectively (Marquart
  TJ et al. 2010; Najafi-Shoushtari SH et al.2010; Horie T et al. 2010). Under conditions
  that stimulate SREBP transcription, miR-33a/b are co-expressed with their host genes
  and reciprocally regulate genes such as ABCA1 that are involved in cellular cholesterol
  efflux and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis (Marquart TJ et al. 2010; Najafi-Shoushtari
  SH et al.2010; Horie T et al. 2010). Expression of the ABCA1 gene is induced by
  oxysterol-activated transcription factors liver X receptor α (LXRα, NR1H3) and LXRβ
  (NR1H2) and their heterodimeric partners, retinoid X receptors (RXR) via functional
  LXR response element (LXRE) in target genes (Costet P et al. 2000; Ignatova ID et
  al. 2013). miR-33 was found to suppress expression of ABCA1 in human macrophages
  (THP-1) and hepatocytes (HepG2, Hep3B ) treated with a synthetic agonist, T0901317,
  of LXRs (Rayner KJ et al. 2010; Marquart TJ et al. 2010). Inhibition of endogenous
  miR-33 by anti-miR-33 increased the expression of ABCA1 in THP-1 and HepG2 cells
  (Rayner KJ et al. 2010). In vivo studies showed that liver ABCA1 protein and serum
  HDL-C levels were higher in miR-33-deficient mice than in control mice (Horie T
  et al. 2010). In line with this, a study reported that healthy individuals with
  high HDL-C levels often overexpress ABCA1 and ABCG1 and show a decrease of miR-33a
  in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Scherrer DZ et al. 2015). Analysis
  of the 3'  untranslated region (3'UTR) of ABCA1 identified sequences that are partially
  complementary to miR-33 sequences (Marquart TJ et al. 2010). Importantly, these
  sequences are evolutionarily conserved across animal species (Marquart TJ et al.
  2010). Further, a 3'UTR luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-33 directly binds
  the ABCA1 3′UTR when human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells were cotransfected with
  luciferase reporter constructs fused to the 3′UTR of ABCA1  and control miR or miR-33
  (Rayner KJ et al. 2010; Horie T et al. 2010; Najafi-Shoushtari SH et al. 2010).
  Mutation in the potential binding site in the 3′-UTR abolished the effect of miR-33
  (Horie T et al. 2010). The Reactome event describes the miR-33- regulated translation
  of ABCA1 mRNA in response to NR1H2,3 natural ligands. The annotation is based on
  studies with T0901317, the synthetic agonist of NR1H2,3 (Rayner KJ et al. 2010;
  Marquart TJ et al. 2010).

## Summary

ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a target of micro RNA 33 (miR-33) (Rayner KJ et al. 2010; Marquart TJ et al. 2010; Najafi-Shoushtari SH et al.2010; Horie T et al. 2010; Zaiou M et al. 2018).
