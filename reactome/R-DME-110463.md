display_name: Increased PIP3 levels recruit DAkt1 to the membrane
species: Drosophila melanogaster
summary: DAkt (a protein kinase B) is recruited to the plasma membrane due to the
  interaction between its PH (pleckstrin homology) domain and PIP3. In Drosophila,
  DAkt appears to be the only target activated by increased PIP3 levels.
