display_name: p-STAT1, p-STAT3 dissociate from IL27RA:IL12RB2 receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin 35 (IL35) can signal via IL35 receptors triggering the JAK/STAT
  pathway downstream. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta
  (STAT1) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 alpha/beta (STAT3)
  bind to the JAK associated IL35 receptor complex and are activated via phosphorylations.
  Subsequently, phosphorylated p STAT1:p STAT3 dissociates from the receptor complex
  (Wang et al. 2014). This is a black box event because there is no literature evidence
  about the exact mechanism of the release of STAT1 and STAT3 from the receptor complex.
