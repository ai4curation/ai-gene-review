stable_id: R-HSA-5654510
display_name: FGFRL1 binds SPRED1/2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FGFRL1 binds to SPRED1 and 2 and Sprouty1 as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation,
  although the exact stoichiometry of the complex remains to be determined. The interaction
  requires the C-terminal residues of the short intracellular domain of FGFRL1 (Zhuang
  et al, 2011).  The SPRED proteins are members of the Sprouty family, with established
  roles as negative regulators of the Ras/Raf/Erk signaling pathway (reviewed in McClatchey
  and Cichowski, 2012).
