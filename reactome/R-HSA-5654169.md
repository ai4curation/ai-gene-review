stable_id: R-HSA-5654169
display_name: p-4Y-PLCG1 dissociates from activated FGFR4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Dissociation from the activated receptor quickly follows phosphorylation
  of PLC-gamma. Phosphorylated PLC-gamma catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol(4,
  5)bisphosphate to generate two second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol (1,4,5)
  triphosphate.
