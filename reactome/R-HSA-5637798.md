display_name: Phosphorylated SHC1 in complex with p-5Y-EGFRvIII recruits GRB2:SOS1
  complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Recruitment of GRB2:SOS1 complex by SHC1 bound to phosphorylated dimers of
  EGFRvIII cancer mutant has not been directly tested, but is assumed to happen in
  the same way it happens with the SHC1 bound to the phosphorylated homodimer of wild-type
  EGFR (Chardin et al. 1993).

## Summary

Recruitment of GRB2:SOS1 complex by SHC1 bound to phosphorylated dimers of EGFRvIII cancer mutant has not been directly tested, but is assumed to happen in the same way it happens with the SHC1 bound to the phosphorylated homodimer of wild-type EGFR (Chardin et al. 1993).
