stable_id: R-HSA-936563
display_name: ISGylation of DDX58
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ISG15 is an ubiquitin (Ub)-like protein which is conjugated to intracellular
  proteins via an isopeptide bond. Similar to ubiquitination, the conjugation of ISG15
  (ISGylation) requires a three-step process, involving an E1 activating enzyme (UBE1L),
  an E2 conjugating enzyme (UbcM8/H8), and HERC5/Ceb1 an IFN-inducible ISG15-specific
  E3 ligase. ISG15 conjugation may play an important regulatory role in IFN-mediated
  antiviral responses. IFN induces ISG15 conjugation to DDX58 (RIG-I) negatively regulating
  DDX58-mediated antiviral signaling. ISGylated DDX58 (RIG-I) becomes subject to an
  irreversible biochemical process, such as proteolysis or proteasomeal degradation.
