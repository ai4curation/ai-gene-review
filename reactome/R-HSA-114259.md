display_name: Cleavage of Procaspase‑9 to caspase‑9
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Procaspase‑9 is processed in an ATP‑dependent manner following association
  with APAF1 and cytochrome c (CYCS) within the apoptosome complex (Li P et al. 1997).
  However, caspase‑9 (CASP9) has an unusually active zymogen that does not require
  proteolytic processing (Stennicke HR et al. 1999). Though dispensable for catalytic
  activity, CASP9 processing was suggested to serve as a "molecular timer" that can
  limit the proteolytic activity of this complex through displacement of bound caspase‑9
  molecules (Malladi S et al. 2009). In addition, this cleavage exposes a neo‑epitope
  comprising the NH2‑terminal four amino acids (ATPF) of the small p12 subunit of
  CASP9 that has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for binding to the
  baculovirus IAP repeat 3 (BIR3) domain of XIAP, leading to inhibition of CASP9 activity
  (Srinivasula SM et al. 2001; Shiozaki EN et al. 2003).
