summary: 'The PMP22 gene encodes a peripheral myelin protein that is a component of
  the myelin sheath surrounding axons in the peripheral nervous system (reviewed in
  Garbay et al, 2000; Svaren and Meijer, 2008). Point mutations and duplications in
  the PMP22 gene cause the most prevalent form of the demyelinating peripheral neuropathy,
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, while deletions lead to Hereditary Neuropathy with
  liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) (reviewed in van Passsen et al, 2014).

  PMP22 expression is controlled by a number of upstream and intronic enhancer elements
  that are bound by EGR2 and SOX10, master regulators of peripheral nerve myelination
  (Nagarajan et al, 2001; Maier et al, 2002; Maier et al, 2003; Jones et al, 2011;
  Jones et al, 2012; Srinivasan et al, 2012). In addition, PMP22 enhancers contain
  binding sites for the Hippo pathway transcription factor TEAD1, and TEAD1 and co-activators
  WWTR1 (also known as TAZ) and YAP1 are required for PMP22 expression (Lopez-Anido
  et al, 2016).'

## Summary
