stable_id: R-HSA-8874979
display_name: ACBD3 binds GOLGB1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Golgi resident protein GCP60 (ACBD3) is a Golgi membrane-associated protein
  thought to be involved in the maintenance of the Golgi structure by interacting
  with Golgin subfamily B member 1 (GOLGB1, giantin), which may mediate protein transport
  between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi (Sohda et al. 2001).
