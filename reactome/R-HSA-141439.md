stable_id: R-HSA-141439
display_name: Release of activated MAD2 from kinetochores
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The mechanism by which the conformationally altered inhibitory form of Mad2
  is released from its association with Mad1 at the kinetochore is not known. Mad1
  and Cdc20 have a common 10 residue Mad2 binding motif. Therefore, one possibility
  is that  Mad2 is transferred competitively from Mad1 to Cdc20 (Luo et al., 2002;
  Sironi et al., 2002).
