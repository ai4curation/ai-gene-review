stable_id: R-HSA-113411
display_name: 2-4 nt.backtracking of Pol II complex on the template leading to elongation
  pausing
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Pol II pausing is believed to result from reversible backtracking of the
  Pol II enzyme complex by ~2 to 4 nucleotides. This leads to misaligned 3'-OH terminus
  that is unable to be an acceptor for the incoming NTPs in synthesis of next  phosphodiester
  bond (reviewed by Shilatifard et al., 2003).

## Summary

Pol II pausing is believed to result from reversible backtracking of the Pol II enzyme complex by ~2 to 4 nucleotides. This leads to misaligned 3'-OH terminus that is unable to be an acceptor for the incoming NTPs in synthesis of next  phosphodiester bond (reviewed by Shilatifard et al., 2003).
