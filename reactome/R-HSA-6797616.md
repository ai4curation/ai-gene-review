display_name: CCNK:CDK12 binds RNA Pol II at DNA repair genes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The complex of CDK12 and CCNK (cyclin K) associates with the RNA polymerase
  II (RNA Pol II) elongation complex at DNA repair genes encoding long primary transcripts,
  such as BRCA1, ATR, FANCI, FANCD2, ATM, MDC1, CHEK1, RAD51D and APEX1 (Blazek et
  al. 2011, Bartkowiak and Greenleaf 2015, Ekumi et al. 2015, Liang et al. 2015).
