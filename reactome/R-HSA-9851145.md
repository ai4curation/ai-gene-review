display_name: Translation of DNMT1 mRNA is repressed by miR-21
species: Homo sapiens
summary: miR-21 represses the translation of DNMT1 mRNA. In the context of NPM1-ALK
  signaling, DNMT1 contributes to the repression of IL2RG expression through promoter
  methylation; STAT3 contributes to this repression in two ways, by directly recruiting
  DNMT1 to the IL2RG promoter, and by downregulating MIR21 gene expression, allowing
  DNMT1 levels to increase (Zhang et al, 2011).
