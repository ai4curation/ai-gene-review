stable_id: R-HSA-913529
display_name: Translocation of p-STAT1:p-STAT1 dimer to nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IFNA-activated-factor (AAF) translocates to nucleus and then promotes the
  expression of a distinct set of gamma activated sequence (GAS)-driven genes like
  IRF1. IRF1, in turn, induces the transcription of ISG15, ISG54 and IFI6 genes. This
  second pathway of STAT1 homodimer formation is primarily activated by IFNG and is
  likely to account for some of the functional overlap between type I and type II
  IFNs.
