stable_id: R-HSA-2197698
display_name: Src phosphorylate WASP,N-WASP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: WASP is phosphorylated on Tyr291 (Cory et al. 2002) and N-WASP (WASL) on
  Tyr256 (Wu et al. 2004) by Src family of tyrosine kinases and this phosphorylation
  may release the autoinhibitory intramolecular interactions. The phosphorylation
  seems to be enhanced by the activation of CDC42. WASP phosphorylation and binding
  of CDC42 have a synergistic effect on the activation of the ARP2/3 complex (Takenawa
  & Suetsugu 2007). In N-WASP, the phosphorylation may reduce its nuclear translocation
  and may sustain it in its functional site in the cytoplasm (Wu et al. 2004).
