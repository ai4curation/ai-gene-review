stable_id: R-HSA-8866546
display_name: RNF5 and RNF185 ubiquitinate misfolded CFTR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RNF5 and RNF185 ubiquitinate misfolded CFTR as part of the retrotranslocon
  that targets the receptor for degradation through the ERAD pathway. Both depletion
  of the E3 ligases by siRNA and expression of a catalytically inactive form of the
  enzyme strongly inhibits CFTR degradation (El Khouri et al, 2013; Younger et al,
  2006).
