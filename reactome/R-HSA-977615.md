species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Factor I (CFI) cleaves the truncated alpha (a'') chain of C4b between Arg-1336
  and Asn-1337 and then again between Arg-956 and Thr-957, producing a 16 kDa fragment
  known as alpha4, derived from the C terminus of the a'' chain, followed by a 27
  kDa alpha3 fragment. The remaining alpha 2 (C4d) fragment stays covalently bound
  to the cell membrane while the complex of disulfide-linked alpha3, alpha4, beta
  chain and gamma chain are released (C4c) into the fluid phase (Fujita et al. 1978). '

## Summary

Factor I (CFI) cleaves the truncated alpha (a') chain of C4b between Arg-1336 and Asn-1337 and then again between Arg-956 and Thr-957, producing a 16 kDa fragment known as alpha4, derived from the C terminus of the a' chain, followed by a 27 kDa alpha3 fragment. The remaining alpha 2 (C4d) fragment stays covalently bound to the cell membrane while the complex of disulfide-linked alpha3, alpha4, beta chain and gamma chain are released (C4c) into the fluid phase (Fujita et al. 1978).
