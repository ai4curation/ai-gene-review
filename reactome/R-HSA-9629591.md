display_name: JMJD7 dimer hydroxlates a lysine residue of DRG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: JMJD7 (JmjC domain-containing protein 7) catalyzes the 3-hydroxlation of
  a lysine residue of DRG1 (developmentally-regulated GTP-binding protein 1). The
  catalytically active form of JMJD7 is a dimer, each monomeric subunit of which is
  associated with a Fe2+ ion (Markolovic et al. 2018). DRG1 occurs as a heterdimer
  with one molecule of ZC3H15 (DFRP1) (Ishikawa et al. 2005, 2009).
