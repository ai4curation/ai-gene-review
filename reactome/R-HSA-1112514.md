species: Homo sapiens
summary: The molecular mechanism of Jak activation upon cytokine stimulation is not
  understood in detail (Haan et al. 2008). Cytokine-induced receptor aggregation and
  the resulting close proximity of Jaks bound to the beta receptor subunit is believed
  to trigger trans-phosphorylation of Jak tyrosines in their kinase activation loop,
  confering kinase activity. This active state is believed to be maintained by further
  autocatalytic tyrosine phosphorylations. For JAK1 the activation loop tyrosine residues
  are predicted by homology with models of JAK2 (Lindauer et al. 2001) to be Tyr-1034/1035.
  Mutation of Tyr-1034 abolishes JAK1 kinase activity (Liu et al. 1997). Evidence
  supporting JAK1 transphosphorylation includes JAK1 mutant cell lines, which cannot
  activate Tyk2 after stimulation with interferon alpha/beta (Velazquez et al. 1995)
  and the observation that IL-2 cannot activate JAK1 in the absence of JAK3 (Oakes
  et al. 1996). The receptor is not merely a docking site for JAKs as certain gp130
  residues are required for JAK1 activation, but not essential for JAK1 binding (Haan
  et al. 2002).
