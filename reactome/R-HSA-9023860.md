display_name: Histone acetyltransferases are recruited to the TFF1 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Estrogen-dependent expression of TFF1 depends on the recruitment of histone
  acetyltransferases such as KAT5, EP300, CITED1 and KAT2B, as well as coactivators
  such as NCOA1 and NCOA3 (Métivier et al, 2003; reviewed in Arnal et al, 2017).  ChIP
  analysis suggests that NCOA1 and NCOA3 do not co-occupy the TFF1 promoter, but may
  be differentially recruited under different conditions (Métivier et al, 2003). Note
  that the acetyltransferase activity of these HATs is not depicted in this diagram.
