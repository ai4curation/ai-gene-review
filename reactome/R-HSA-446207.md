display_name: ALG13:ALG14 transfers GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to GlcNAcDOLP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A second N-acetylglucosamine is added to the N-glycan precursor via a beta-1,4
  linkage. This reaction is catalyzed by the ALG13:ALG14 complex, in which ALG13 functions
  as the catalyst and ALG14 functions as a membrane anchor which recruits ALG13 to
  the cytosolic face of ER (Gao XD et al, 2005).
