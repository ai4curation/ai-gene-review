display_name: PERP binds desmosomes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PERP (p53 effector related to PMP-22) is a p53/p63 target gene involved in
  DNA damage-induced apoptosis (Flores et al. 2002).  It is a tetraspan membrane protein,distantly
  related to members of the claudin/PMP-22/EMP family of four-pass membrane proteins
  (Attardi et al. 2000). It has an epithelial-specific expression pattern during embryogenesis
  and localizes to desmosomes. Perp -/- knockout mice exhibit numerous desmosomal
  structural defects, suggesting a role for Perp in promoting the stable assembly
  of desmosomal adhesive complexes (Ihrie et al. 2005).
