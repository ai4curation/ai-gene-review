  apoptosome (Hu Q et al. 2014; Cheng TC et al. 2016). The cryo-EM structures have

  the heptameric oligomerization of APAF1, while its tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD40)
  domain interacts with CYCS (Yuan S & Akey CW 2013). The caspase recruitment domain
  (CARD) of APAF1 recruits the N‑terminal CARD of CASP9(1‑416) through homotypic CARD:CARD
  interactions (Li P et al. 1997; Qin H et al. 1999; Yuan S et al. 2010; Yuan S &
  Akey CW 2013). These homotypic interaction motifs are thought to interact with each

  generate homo- and hetero-oligomers from relatively small assemblies to open-ended
  filaments (Ferrao R & Wu H 2012). Structural and mutagenesis studies showed that
