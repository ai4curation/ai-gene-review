display_name: Monoubiquitinated PTEN translocates to the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Monoubiquitinated PTEN translocates to the nucleus. Lysine residues K13 and
  K289 of PTEN are important monoubiquitination targets and their mutation abrogates
  PTEN nuclear localization (Trotman et al. 2007).
