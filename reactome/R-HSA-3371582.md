stable_id: R-HSA-3371582
display_name: HSBP1 binds HSF1 trimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Heat shock factor binding protein 1 (HSBP1) is a nuclear localized hydrophobic
  repeat-containing protein, which interacts with trimerization domain of HSF1 and
  negatively regulates DNA-binding activity of HSF1. Overexpression of HSBP1 in mammalian
  cells represses the transactivation activity of HSF1 (Satyal SH et al. 1998).
