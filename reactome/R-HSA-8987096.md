species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is phosphorylated
  after binding to Interleukin-24 (IL24) activated receptor complex. This activated
  receptor complex is formed by IL24 ligand, Interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-1
  (IL22RA1), phosphorylated Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and Interleukin-20
  receptor subunit beta (IL20RB) (Parrish-Novak et al. 2002, Wang et al. 2002, Dumoutier
  et al. 2001).<br>This is a black box event since the identity of the phosphorylated
  residues in STAT3 is unknown.
