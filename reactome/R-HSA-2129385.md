display_name: MFAP2, MFAP5 bind microfibrils
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Microfibrils are composed largely of fibrillin but also contain covalently-linked
  microfibril associated glycoproteins MAGP-1 (MFAP2) and  MAGP-2 (MFAP5).  MFAP2
  is a structural component of almost all vertebrate microfibrils (Gibson et al. 1989,
  Trask et al. 2000, Jensen et al. 2001). It appears to be important for tissue development
  and/or homeostasis, including regulation of bone remodelling and deposition of tissue
  fat (Weinbaum et al. 2008). The C-terminal half of MFAP2 is rich in cysteines and
  contains a matrix-binding domain that facilitates interactions with fibrillin (Weinbaum
  et al. 2008). The related MFAP5 similarly binds to microfibrils (Gibson et al. 1998)
  but with a restricted expression profile. '
