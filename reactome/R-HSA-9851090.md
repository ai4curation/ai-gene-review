display_name: NPM1-ALK binds NPM1 and FOXM1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Nuclear NPM-ALK binds to endogenous full-length NPM and FOXM1 in ALK+ ALCL
  cells as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation (Haque et al, 2019). Endogenous NPM1
  likely bridges the interaction between NPM-ALK and FOXM1, as the FOXM1-binding region
  of NPM1 is not conserved in the fusion protein and NPM1-ALK has been shown to form
  heterodimers with NPM1 (Box et al, 2016; Khan et al, 2015; Bhat et al, 2011). Formation
  of this complex is required for FOXM1-dependent expression of target genes such
  as CCNB1 (Cyclin B1), and consistent with this, both NPM-ALK and FOXM1 are detected
  in complex with a biotinylated FOXM1-consensus containing DNA target in ALCL lines
  and bind to the CCNB1 promoter as assessed by ChIP (Haque et al, 2019).<br>STAT3
  likely contributes to the NPM1-ALK:FOXM1 signaling axis, as lentiviral knockdown
  of FOXM1 decreases phosphorylation of both STAT3 and NPM1-ALK, as well as decreasing
  expression of CCNB1. The significance of FOXM1-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3
  and NPM1-ALK remains to be clarified (Haque et al, 2019).
