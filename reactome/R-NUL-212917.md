display_name: Proteasome mediated degradation of PAK-2p34
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Proteolytically activated PAK-2p34, but not full-length PAK-2, is degraded
  rapidly by the proteasome (Jakobi et al., 2003).  Here, degradation of PAK-2p34
  is described as occurring in the cytosol. However, to date it is not known whether
  this occurs in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm.
