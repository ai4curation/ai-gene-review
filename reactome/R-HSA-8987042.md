species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Inferred from rat, mouse, human :Tyrosine protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and
  Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase TYK2 (TYK2) are believed to be phosphorylated
  after Interleukin-22 interacts with its receptor. The receptor is a complex formed
  by Interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL22RA1), JAK1, Interleukin-10 receptor
  subunit beta (IL10RB) and TYK2 (Lejeune et al. 2002, Sabat et al. 2014).

  This is a black-box event because the JAK1/TYK2 coordinates phosphorylated after
  IL22 stimulus are unknown.'

## Summary

Inferred from rat, mouse, human :Tyrosine protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase TYK2 (TYK2) are believed to be phosphorylated after Interleukin-22 interacts with its receptor. The receptor is a complex formed by Interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL22RA1), JAK1, Interleukin-10 receptor subunit beta (IL10RB) and TYK2 (Lejeune et al. 2002, Sabat et al. 2014).
This is a black-box event because the JAK1/TYK2 coordinates phosphorylated after IL22 stimulus are unknown.
