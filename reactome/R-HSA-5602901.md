display_name: Defective GSS does not synthesize GSH
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the second step in glutathione formation, gamma-glutamylcysteine (gGluCys)
  ligates with glycine (Gly) to form glutathione (GSH), catalysed by glutathione synthetase
  (GSS), a homodimeric enzyme present in the cytosol. Defects in GSS can cause glutathione
  synthetase deficiency (GSSD aka 5-oxoprolinase deficiency, MIM:266130), a severe,
  autosomal recessive disorder characterised by an increased rate of haemolysis, 5-oxoprolinuria
  and defective function of the central nervous system. In this condition, decreased
  levels of cellular glutathione result in overstimulation of gamma-glutamylcysteine
  synthesis and its subsequent conversion to 5-oxoproline. Mutations causing severe
  GSSD include R164Q, R267W, R283C, R125C and P314L (Shi et al. 1996).

## Summary
