stable_id: R-HSA-77592
display_name: Cleavage of Intronless Pre-mRNA at 3'-end
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The polypeptide catalyzing the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond remains
  to be identified. Cleavage produces a 3'-OH on the upstream fragment and a 5'-phosphate
  on the downstream fragment. At some unknown point after cleavage, the downstream
  fragment, CstF, CF I and CF II are thought to be released, whereas CPSF and poly(A)
  polymerase remain to carry out polyadenylation.
