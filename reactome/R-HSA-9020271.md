display_name: GPX4-2 reduces 17(R)-Hp-DHA to 17(R)-HDHA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cytosolic phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPX4 isoform
  2, GPX4-2) (Yagi et al. 1996) is a likely candidate for the reduction of organic
  hydroperoxides such as 17(R)-hydroperoxy-docosahexaenoic acid (17(R)-Hp-DHA) to
  17(R)-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17(R)-HDHA) (Han et al. 2013) using glutathione
  (GSH) as an electron donor (Brigelius-Flohe & Maiorino 2013). 17(R)-HDHA can then
  be transformed into 17(R)-D-resolvins and a 17-oxo electrophilic product 17-oxo-DHA
  (Groeger et al. 2010).
