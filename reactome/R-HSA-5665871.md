stable_id: R-HSA-5665871
display_name: ADRM1 binds 26S proteasome
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ADRM1 (also called Rpn13) interacts with the 26S proteasome base unit PRDM1
  (Rpn2) via its amino-terminus and is found in the majority of 26S proteasomes. It
  is a receptor for Ubiquitin (Ub) that can bind K48-linked di-Ub (Schreiner et al.
  2008, Husnjak et al. 2008) and de-ubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) such as PSMD14 (Rpn11,
  POH1), USP14, and UCHL5 (UCH37) (Reyes-Turcu et al., 2009). Together, these DUBs
  disassemble poly-Ub chains and recycle ubiquitin during proteasomal degradation.
