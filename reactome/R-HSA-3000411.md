stable_id: R-HSA-3000411
display_name: RANBP2 SUMOylates PML with SUMO2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RANBP2 of the nuclear pore complex SUMOylates PML with SUMO2 at lysine-65,
  lysine-160, and lysine-490 (Kamitani et al. 1998, Tatham et al. 2005). RANBP2 contains
  both a binding site for SUMO1 and a binding site for UBE2I (Tatham et al. 2005).
  The binding site for UBE2I participates in SUMOylation of PML with SUMO2. SUMO2
  colocalizes significantly with PML bodies (Vertegaal et al. 2004).
