species: Homo sapiens
summary: Histone acetyltransferases recruited by the B‑WICH complex acetylate histone
  H3 at lysine‑9. Knockdown of the BAZ1B (WSTF) and MYOIC components of B‑WICH cause
  a loss of histone acetyltransferases KAT2B (PCAF), KAT2A (GCN5), and EP300 (p300)
  and a reduction of acetylated histone H3. Knockdown of KAT2B (PCAF) causes a reduction
  in acetylation of histone H3 at lysine‑9, leading to reduced rRNA synthesis levels
  (Sarshad et al. 2013, Shen et al. 2013).

Knockdown of the BAZ1B (WSTF) and MYOIC components of B‑WICH cause a loss of histone acetyltransferases KAT2B (PCAF), KAT2A (GCN5), and EP300 (p300) and a reduction of acetylated histone H3. Knockdown of KAT2B (PCAF) causes a reduction in acetylation of histone H3 at lysine‑9, leading to reduced rRNA synthesis levels (Sarshad et al. 2013, Shen et al. 2013).
