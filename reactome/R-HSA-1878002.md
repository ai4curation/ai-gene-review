stable_id: R-HSA-1878002
display_name: XYLTs transfer Xyl to core protein
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Xylosyltransferases (XYLT1, XYLT2) catalyse the initial step in the tetrasaccharide
  linkage required forglycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. This reaction can take place
  in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (not shown here). XYLTs mediates
  the transfer of xylose from the active nucleotide sugar UDP-xylose to specific serine
  hydroxy groups in the core protein. A C-terminal DxD motif on the enzyme is thought
  to be critical for activity (Muller et al. 2005, Goetting et al. 2004, Voglmeir
  et al. 2007).
