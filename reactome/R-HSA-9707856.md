display_name: PGRMC2:Hemes dissociates
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Free heme behaves differently in the nucleus, in the absence of PGRMC2. This
  implies that heme may separate from the PGRMC2:heme complex. The exact conditions
  under which dissociation might occur are unknown (Galmozzi et al, 2019).

## Summary

Free heme behaves differently in the nucleus, in the absence of PGRMC2. This implies that heme may separate from the PGRMC2:heme complex. The exact conditions under which dissociation might occur are unknown (Galmozzi et al, 2019).
