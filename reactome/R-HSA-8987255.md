summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta (STAT1) or
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) are believed to be phosphorylated
  by the Interleukin 26 (IL26) receptor complex,which consists of IL26, Interleukin-10
  receptor subunit beta (IL10RB), phosphorylated Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase
  TYK2 (TYK2), Interleukin-20 receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA), phosphorylated Tyrosine-protein
  kinase JAK1 (JAK1) (Sheikh et al. 2004), STAT1 and STAT3.<br> This is a black box
  event since there is no direct evidence that STAT1 or STAT3 bind the receptor complex
  before being phosphorylated, but this can be inferred from the signaling mechanism
  of other related interleukin receptors such as IL10 (Weber-Nordt et al. 1996, Braum
  et al. 2013).
