display_name: FGFR2c-specific alternative splicing produces FGFR2c transcript
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In mesenchymal cells, FGFR2 IIIc exon splicing is favoured by the binding
  of PTB1 to intronic splice silencer (ISS) sequences 1 and 2 that flank the IIIb
  specific exon, and by the binding of hnRNPA1 to an exonic splicing silencer (ESS)
  within the IIIb specific exon (Del Gatto-Konczak et al, 1999; Carstens et al, 2000).  Binding
  of these proteins to the nascent mRNA , which occurs in the context of a larger
  splicing complex, represses IIIb-specific alternative splicing and favours the formation
  of FGFR2 IIIc-specific mRNA.
