display_name: Phosphorylated SHC1 recruits GRB2:GAB2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylated Shc recruits Grb2 and Gab2, probably by binding to Grb2 in
  the Grb2:Gab2 complex. Gab2 associates with Grb2, Shc, Shp2 and the p85 subunit
  of PI3K (Gu et al. 1998). The association of Grb2 with Gab2 has been suggested to
  be constitutive (Gu et al. 2000, Kong et al. 2003, Harkiolaki et al. 2009), so Gab2
  may be recruited to Shc1 with Grb2. Alternatively, Gab2 has been suggested to associate
  constitutively with Shc (Kong et al 2003). In either case, the result is a complex
  of Shc:Grb2:Gab2. Gab2 binding to p85 (Gu et al. 1998) links Shc1 to PI3K activity
  and subsequent activation of kinases such as Akt (Gu et al. 2000).
