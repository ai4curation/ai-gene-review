display_name: IL24:IL20RA:p-JAK1:IL20RB:STAT1,STAT3 phosphorylates STAT1 or STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta (STAT1) and
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) are believed to be phosphorylated
  after binding the Interleukin-24 (IL24) receptor complex (Parrish Novak et al. 1998,
  Andoh et al. 2009, Wang et al. 2002). This complex consists of IL24 ligand, phosphorylated
  Interleukin-20 receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA), phosphorylated Tyrosine-protein
  kinase JAK1 (JAK1), Interleukin-20 receptor subunit beta (IL20RB)  and STAT1 or
  STAT3 .<br>This is a black box event because STAT binding is inferred to precede
  STAT phosphorylation.
