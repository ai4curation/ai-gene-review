display_name: SPT5 subunit of Pol II binds the RNA triphosphatase (RTP)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The capping enzyme interacts with the Spt5 subunit of  transcription elongation
  factor DSIF.  This interaction may couple the capping reaction with promoter escape
  or elongation, thereby acting as a "checkpoint" to assure that capping has occurred
  before the polymerase proceeds to make the rest of the  transcript (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis
  et al.2011).

## Summary

The capping enzyme interacts with the Spt5 subunit of  transcription elongation factor DSIF.  This interaction may couple the capping reaction with promoter escape or elongation, thereby acting as a "checkpoint" to assure that capping has occurred before the polymerase proceeds to make the rest of the  transcript (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et al.2011).
