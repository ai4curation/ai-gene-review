display_name: HNP1-4 are released into phagocytic vacuoles
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Human neutrophils contain thousands of cytoplasmic granules. These membrane-bound
  organelles act as storage compartments destined for secretion or in the case of
  azurophil granules, destined for fusion with phagosomes. A small amount of defensin,
  but perhaps not enough for antimicrobial  activity, may be released extracellularly
  by neutrophils (Ganz 1987).
