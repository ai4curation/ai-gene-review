stable_id: R-HSA-112392
display_name: Resumption of elongation after recovery from pausing
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Recovery from pausing occurs spontaneously after a variable length of time
  as the enzyme spontaneously slides forward again. This renders the transcript's
  3'-OH terminus realigned with the catalytic Mg2+ site of the enzyme. TFIIS is capable
  of excising the nascent transcript at 2 or 3 nucleotides upstream of the transcript's
  3'-end to reinitiate processive elongation (reviewed by Shilatifard et al., 2003).

## Summary

Recovery from pausing occurs spontaneously after a variable length of time as the enzyme spontaneously slides forward again. This renders the transcript's 3'-OH terminus realigned with the catalytic Mg2+ site of the enzyme. TFIIS is capable of excising the nascent transcript at 2 or 3 nucleotides upstream of the transcript's 3'-end to reinitiate processive elongation (reviewed by Shilatifard et al., 2003).
