display_name: Dual mechanism MAP2K inhibitors bind MAP2Ks
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Although mutations in MAP2K proteins are infrequent in human cancers, the
  position of these kinases downstream of RAS and RAF make them good candidates for
  therapeutic targeting. Dual mechanism inhibitors such as trametinib bind to non-phosphorylated
  MAP2K proteins, inhibiting their MAPK-directed kinase activity as well as preventing
  their phosphorylation by RAF proteins (Hatzivassiliou et al, 2013; Lito et al, 2014;
  Ishii et al, 2013; reviewed in Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014).
