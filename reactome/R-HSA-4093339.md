stable_id: R-HSA-4093339
display_name: p120-RasGAP activates GTP hydrolysis on RAS, inactivating it
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The p120-RasGAP C-terminus contains a GAP domain that catalyses the activation
  of H-Ras by hydrolyzing GTP-bound active Ras into an inactive GDP-bound form of
  Ras. Inactivation of H-Ras by EPHB2 down regulates MAP kinase phosphorylation and
  induces neurite retraction in neuronal cells (Elowe et al. 2001, Tong et al. 2003).
