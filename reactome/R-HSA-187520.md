stable_id: R-HSA-187520
display_name: Cyclin E/A:Cdk2-mediated  phosphorylation of p27/p21
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The interaction between the Skp2 subunit of the SCF(Skp2) complex and p27
  is dependent upon Cdk2:Cyclin A/E mediated phosphorylation of p27 at Thr 187 (Carrano
  et al, 1999; Tsvetkov et al, 1999). There is evidence that Cyclin A/B:Cdk1 can also
  bind and phosphorylate p27 on Thr 187 (Nakayama et al., 2004).   This phosphorylation
  is also essential for the subsequent ubiquitination of p27.
