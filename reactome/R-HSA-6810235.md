display_name: RPAP2 binds RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at serine-7 residues of
  heptad repeats in the C-terminal domain
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The protein phosphatase RPAP2 binds RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at serine-7
  of the C-terminal domain (CTD) (Egloff et al. 2012). RPRD1A and RPRD1B bind RNA
  polymerase II with RPAP2 and appear to act as scaffolds for the complex (Ni et al.
  2011, Ni et al. 2014).
