summary: Sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin (SM) are essential components of cellular
  membranes and dynamic regulators of many cellular processes in most organisms. Ceramides
  constitute the backbone of all sphingolipids and are synthesized on the cytosolic
  surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then transported to the Golgi for
  conversion to SM. The ER-membrane resident protein sphingomyelin synthase-related
  protein 1 (SAMD8) catalyzes the synthesis of the SM analog ceramide phosphoethanolamine
  (CPE) in the ER lumen. SAMD8 only produces trace amounts of CPE, but blocking its
  catalytic activity causes a substantial rise in ER ceramide levels and a structural
  collapse of the early secretory pathway. SAMD8 is, therefore, a key regulator of
  ceramide homeostasis, functioning as a sensor rather than a converter of ceramides
  in the ER (Vacaru et al., 2009). SAMD8 self-associates into ER-resident trimers
  and hexamers (Cabukusta et al., 2017). The biological role of the produced CPE in
  humans needs to be better defined. However, it is the main sphingolipid in arthropods
  and some protozoa and bacteria (see review by Panewska et al., 2019).

## Summary

Sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin (SM) are essential components of cellular membranes and dynamic regulators of many cellular processes in most organisms. Ceramides constitute the backbone of all sphingolipids and are synthesized on the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then transported to the Golgi for conversion to SM. The ER-membrane resident protein sphingomyelin synthase-related protein 1 (SAMD8) catalyzes the synthesis of the SM analog ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) in the ER lumen. SAMD8 only produces trace amounts of CPE, but blocking its catalytic activity causes a substantial rise in ER ceramide levels and a structural collapse of the early secretory pathway. SAMD8 is, therefore, a key regulator of ceramide homeostasis, functioning as a sensor rather than a converter of ceramides in the ER (Vacaru et al., 2009).
