display_name: Sequestration of BAD protein by 14-3-3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 14-3-3 proteins bind BAD phosphorylated by activated AKT on serine residue
  S99 (corresponds to mouse Bad serine residue S136). Binding of 14-3-3 proteins to
  p-S99-BAD facilitates subsequent phosphorylation of BAD on serine residue S118 (corresponds
  to mouse serine S155), which disrupts binding of BAD to BCL2 proteins and promotes
  cell survival (Datta et al. 2000). Caspase-3 mediated cleavage of 14-3-3 proteins
  releases BAD and promotes apoptosis (Won et al. 2003). All known 14-3-3 protein
  isoforms (beta/alpha i.e. YWHAB, gamma i.e. YWHAG, zeta/delta i.e. YWHAZ, epsilon
  i.e. YWHAE, eta i.e. YWHAH, sigma i.e. SFN and theta i.e. YWHAQ) can interact with
  BAD and inhibit it (Subramanian et al. 2001, Chen et al. 2005).

## Summary
