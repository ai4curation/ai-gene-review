summary: 'The recruitment of CHEK1 (CHK1) to resected DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
  and activation by ATR-mediated phosphorylation requires the presence of CLSPN (claspin)
  and TIMELESS:TIPIN protein complex. TIPIN simultaneously interacts with the RPA2
  subunit of the RPA complex and CLSPN, allowing CLSPN to stably associate with resected
  DNA DSBs (Kemp et al. 2010). Phosphorylation of CLSPN at threonine T916 and serine
  S945 is needed for CHEK1 binding (Kumagai et al. 2003, Clarke and Clarke 2005).
  CLSPN phosphorylation at these sites is independent of CHEK1 (Bennett et al. 2008).
