display_name: BESTs transport cytosolic Cl- to extracellular region
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Bestrophins 1-4 (BEST1-4, aka vitelliform macular dystrophy proteins) mediate
  cytosolic Cl- efflux across plasma membranes. This transport is sensitive to intracellular
  Ca2+ concentrations (Sun et al. 2002, Tsunenari et al. 2003). Mutations in bestrophins
  that impair their function are implicated in macular degeneration in the eye. Defects
  in BEST1 cause vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD, Best's disease, MIM:153700),
  an autosomal dominant form of macular degeneration that usually begins in childhood
  and is characterized lesions due to abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin within and
  beneath retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (Marquardt et al. 1998, Petrukhin
  et al. 1998). All CLCAs contain a consensus cleavage motif which is recognised by
  an internal zincin metalloprotease domain within the N terminus. Self-proteolysis
  within the secretory pathway yields N- and C-terminal fragments, a step critical
  for CLCA activation of calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) mediated through
  the N-terminal fragment (Yurtsever et al. 2012).

## Summary

Bestrophins 1-4 (BEST1-4, aka vitelliform macular dystrophy proteins) mediate cytosolic Cl- efflux across plasma membranes. This transport is sensitive to intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (Sun et al. 2002, Tsunenari et al. 2003). Mutations in bestrophins that impair their function are implicated in macular degeneration in the eye. Defects in BEST1 cause vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD, Best's disease, MIM:153700), an autosomal dominant form of macular degeneration that usually begins in childhood and is characterized lesions due to abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin within and beneath retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (Marquardt et al. 1998, Petrukhin et al. 1998).
