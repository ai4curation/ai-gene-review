display_name: ANKZF1 cleaves the peptidyl-tRNA in VCP hexamer:LTN1:NEMF:60S ribosome
  subunit:peptidyl-tRNA with K48polyUb-nascent peptide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ANKZF1 cleaves the C-terminal 3 nucleotides, CCA, of the tRNA in the peptidyl-tRNA
  bound to the 60S ribosomal subunit, yielding a free tRNA and the nascent peptide
  covalently bound to the CCA sequence (Verma et al. 2018, Yip et al. 2019, and inferred
  from the yeast homolog, VMS1, in Verma et al. 2018, Yip et al. 2019). In yeast,
  Arb1 (mammalian ABCF2) occupies the E-site of the collided ribosome, extending a
  domain towards the peptidyl-tRNA that may help position it for release by Vms1/ANKZF1
  (Su et al. 2019). ANKZF1 interacts strongly with VCP (Hänzelmann and Schindelin
  2011).
