species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Kinectin, a kinesin anchor involved in kinesin-mediated vesicle motility,
  interacts with GTP bound (active) forms of Rho GTPases RHOG (Vignal et al. 2001),
  RHOA, RAC1 and CDC42 (Hotta et al. 1996). Separate domains of kinectin are responsible
  for its interaction with RHOG and RHOA (Vignal et al. 2001). Based on several studies
  in different organisms, kinectin likely exists as a coiled-coil dimer (Yu et al.
  1995, Leung et al. 1996, Kumar et al. 1998, Xu et al. 2002). '

## Summary

Kinectin, a kinesin anchor involved in kinesin-mediated vesicle motility, interacts with GTP bound (active) forms of Rho GTPases RHOG (Vignal et al. 2001), RHOA, RAC1 and CDC42 (Hotta et al. 1996). Separate domains of kinectin are responsible for its interaction with RHOG and RHOA (Vignal et al. 2001). Based on several studies in different organisms, kinectin likely exists as a coiled-coil dimer (Yu et al. 1995, Leung et al. 1996, Kumar et al. 1998, Xu et al. 2002).
