display_name: p-STAT1 dimer translocates from the cytosol to the nucleoplasm
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta (STAT1) dimer
  translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus after Interleukin-24 stimulus (IL24)
  (in BHK cells bearing IL 20RA/IL 20RB) (Parrish Novak et al. 2007). This is a black
  box event because the mechanism by which this event occurs (diffusion, transport)
  is unknown (Darnell 1997).

## Summary

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta (STAT1) dimer translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus after Interleukin-24 stimulus (IL24) (in BHK cells bearing IL 20RA/IL 20RB) (Parrish Novak et al. 2007). This is a black box event because the mechanism by which this event occurs (diffusion, transport) is unknown (Darnell 1997).
