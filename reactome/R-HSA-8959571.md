display_name: LC3 binds the autophagosome membrane Atg5-Atg12 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The mitochondrion is engulfed after elongation of the isolation membrane.
  Once the autophagosome is formed, its outer membrane fuses with lysosomes to form
  the autolysosome. The lysosomal hydrolases (cathepsins and lipases) ultimately degrade
  the damaged mitochondrion and its associated proteins.
