stable_id: R-HSA-5607757
display_name: K63polyUb-TRAF6 ubiquitinates TAK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2), or its homologue TAB3, binds preferentially
  to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in TRAF6 and links TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6) to TAK1 (Transforming growth factor beta-associated kinase 1). TRAF6 ubiquitinates
  TAK1 on K34 and K158 and this triggers conformational changes in TAK1 that lead
  to autophosphorylation and activation (Fan et al. 2010, Hamidi et al. 2011).
