display_name: OTUB1, (OTUB2) binds RNF128, TRAF3, TRAF6, RHOA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'OTUB1 (and OTUB2) can bind TP53 ( Sun et al. 2012) RNF128 (GRAIL) (Soares
  et al. 2009), TRAF3 and TRAF6 (Li et al. 2010) and RhoA (Edelmann et al. 2010).
  OTUB1 has DUB activity but mainly acts by suppressing ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes,
  independently of its catalytic activity (Sun & Dai 2014). '
