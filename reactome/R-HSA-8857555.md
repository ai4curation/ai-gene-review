display_name: EGFR phosphorylates GPNMB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HBEGF-bound EGFR phosphorylates its heterodimerization partner GPNMB at tyrosine
  residue Y525 (Lin et al. 2016). It is not clear whether trans-autophosphorylation
  of HBEGF-bound EGFR homodimers precedes heterodimerization of EGFR with GPNBM and
  GPNMB phosphorylation or if the interaction of GPNMB with the kinase domain of EGFR
  is sufficient for EGFR kinase activation.
