display_name: Fructose catabolism
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Fructose occurs naturally in foods as a free monosaccharide and as a component
  of the disaccharide sucrose. It is also widely used as a sweetener. In the body,
  fructose catabolism occurs in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidney and
  small intestine. In these tissues, it is converted to dihydroxyacetone phosphate
  and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, two intermediates in the glycolytic pathway, in
  a sequence of three reactions. It is phosphorylated to form fructose 1-phosphate,
  which is cleaved by aldolase to yield dihydroxyacetone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde,
  and the latter compound is phosphorylated to yield D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
  Other pathways exist for the conversion of D-glyceraldehyde to intermediates of
  glycolysis, but these appear to play only a minor role in normal fructose metabolism
  (Sillero et al. 1969).
