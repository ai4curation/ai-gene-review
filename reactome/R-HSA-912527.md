display_name: SHC1 mediates cytokine-induced phosphorylation of GAB2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Binding of Gab2 to tyrosine phosphorylated Shc promotes the phosphorylation
  of Gab2 by an unknown kinase. Gab2 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in response to
  IL-2 (Brockdorff et al. 2001) and IL-3 (Gu et al. 1998). Chimeric receptors were
  used to demonstrate that Shc is sufficient for Gab2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In
  response to IL-3, Grb2 was also required, reflecting that Gab2 is recruited to the
  activated cytokine receptor complex as a complex of Gab2:Grb2 (Gu et al. 2000).
