stable_id: R-HSA-9009558
display_name: IL34 dimer binds SDC1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-34 (IL34) is involved in the survival, proliferation and differentiation
  of monocytes and macrophages. Syndecan-1 (SDC1) is a cell surface proteoglycan that
  contains the chondroitin sulphate and primarily functions to link the cytoskeleton
  to the interstitial matrix. IL34 dimers can bind to the chondroitin sulphate of
  SDC1. Subsequently, SDC1 modulates IL34-induced CSF1R signaling pathways (Segaliny
  et al. 2015). Ultimately, these events lead to the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines
  regulating the innate immunity and inflammation.
