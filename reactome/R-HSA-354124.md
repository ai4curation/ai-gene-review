stable_id: R-HSA-354124
display_name: Phosphorylation of pPTK2 by SRC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The recruitment of FADK1 to active SRC leads to the efficient tyrosine phosphorylation
  of multiple additional sites on FADK1. SRC trans-phosphorylates FADK1 within the
  kinase doman activation loop (Y576 and Y577) and within the FADK1 C-terminal domain
  (Y861 and Y925).
