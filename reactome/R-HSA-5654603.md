display_name: Activated FGFR2 binds FRS3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'FRS3 (also known as FRS2beta) is predominantly expressed in the developing
  and adult neuroepithelium. As is the case for FRS2 (also known as FRS2alpha), binding
  of FRS3 to FGFR may be constitutive and/or independent of receptor activation.  Elements
  of the downstream signaling mediated by the two FRS family members appear to be
  at least partially conserved, as FRS3 is phosphorylated upon FGF stimulation, binds
  PPTN11/SHP2 and GRB2 and results in ERK activation. Moreover, expression of FRS3
  in FRS2-/- MEFs restores ERK activation.  '
