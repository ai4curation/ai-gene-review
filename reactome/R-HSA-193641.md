stable_id: R-HSA-193641
display_name: IKK-beta is recruited
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NGF stimulation results in recruitment of IKK-beta (Inhibitor of nuclear
  factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta) to the p75NTR receptor complex. IKK-beta recruitment
  involves p62 (Wooten et al. 2001,  Cao et al. 1996a, et al. 1996b ).
