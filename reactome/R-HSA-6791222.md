display_name: 21S pre-rRNA is nucleolytically processed at site E (site2a) to yield
  18SE pre-rRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: An unknown endonuclease in the nucleolus cleaves at site E (site 2a in mouse)
  of 21S pre-rRNA, yielding 18SE pre-rRNA (Preti et al. 2013, Sloan et al. 2013).
  Evidence also indicates that 18SE may also be produced by an exonucleolytic pathway
  (Carron et al. 2011, Sloan et al. 2013). BYSL (Bystin, ENG1), SKIV2L2 (MTR4), and
  the exonuclease activity of EXOSC10 (RRP6), all associated with the exosome, are
  required for formation of 18SE by the exonucleolytic pathway (Sloan et al. 2013).
  Sequencing indicates that 18SE molecules can have variable ends, presumably due
  to exonuclease activity (Preti et al. 2013).

## Summary

An unknown endonuclease in the nucleolus cleaves at site E (site 2a in mouse) of 21S pre-rRNA, yielding 18SE pre-rRNA (Preti et al. 2013, Sloan et al. 2013). Evidence also indicates that 18SE may also be produced by an exonucleolytic pathway (Carron et al. 2011, Sloan et al. 2013). BYSL (Bystin, ENG1), SKIV2L2 (MTR4), and the exonuclease activity of EXOSC10 (RRP6), all associated with the exosome, are required for formation of 18SE by the exonucleolytic pathway (Sloan et al. 2013).
