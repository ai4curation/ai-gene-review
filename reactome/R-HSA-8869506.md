species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'TNFAIP3 can remove K63-linked ubiquitin from TRAF6, which terminates signalling
  by Toll-like receptors (Boone et al. 2004). TNFAIP3 is essential for the termination
  of NFkappaB activation in response to multiple stimuli such as IL-1beta, TNF, IL-6,
  CD40 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Removal of K63-linked ubiquitin is not necessarily
  followed by K48-ubiquitination that would lead to degradation (Vereecke et al. 2009). '
