display_name: Phosphorylated GPNMB recruits PTK6 and LRRK2 in the presence of LINC01139
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation of GPNBM at tyrosine residue Y525 upon heterodimerization
  with HBEGF-bound EGFR promotes, in the presence of long non-coding RNA LINC011139
  (LINK-A), the recruitment of PTK6 (BRK). In addition to PTK6, LINC01139 simultaneously
  recruits serine/threonine kinase LRRK2 to phosphorylated GPNBM (Lin et al. 2016).

## Summary

Phosphorylation of GPNBM at tyrosine residue Y525 upon heterodimerization with HBEGF-bound EGFR promotes, in the presence of long non-coding RNA LINC011139 (LINK-A), the recruitment of PTK6 (BRK). In addition to PTK6, LINC01139 simultaneously recruits serine/threonine kinase LRRK2 to phosphorylated GPNBM (Lin et al. 2016).
