display_name: BCAP Signalosome phosphorylates PI(4,5)P2 forming PI(3,4,5)P3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PI3K generates phosphoinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) from PIP2 after
  activation of the BCR (Gold et al. 1992, Chantry et al. 1997). Experiments in mice
  indicate that PI3K associated with BCAP is partly responsible for the activity (Aiba
  et al. 2008). (PI3K associated with CD19 is also partly responsible (Aiba et al.
  2008).)
