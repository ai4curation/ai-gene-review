stable_id: R-HSA-430135
display_name: p-SLP-76 binds ADAP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SLP-76 inducibly-associates with ADAP (also known as FYN-binding protein
  or SLAP-130) a hematopoietic-specific adapter protein. ADAP has been implicated
  in T cell migration and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. In platelets, adhesion
  to fibrinogen stimulates the association of SLP-76 with ADAP and VASP (Obergfell
  et al. 2001). ADAP knockout mice exhibit mild thrombocytopenia (Kasirer-Friede et
  al. 2007).
