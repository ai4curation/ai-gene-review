display_name: ISGylation of BECN1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Beclin-1 (BECN1) is an activator of autophagy. Its activity is decreased
  by ISGylation of two residues, triggered by interferon-beta. Human respiratory syncytial
  virus (hRSV) NS2 protein inhibits BECN1 ISGylation to activate autophagy pathways
  during hRSV infection (Chiok et al, 2022).
