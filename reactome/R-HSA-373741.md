stable_id: R-HSA-373741
display_name: SDK2 homophillic interaction
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SDK1 and SDK2 are homophilic adhesion molecules. Cells expressing them exhibit
  a strong preference to interact exclusively with cells expressing the same sidekick
  form. The N-terminal four Ig domains are arranged in a horseshoe conformation and
  mediate homophilic adhesion, with Ig1-2 conferring the majority of binding affinity
  and differential specificity.
