species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'TRAF6 oligomerization is induced by IRAK1. The TRAF6 oligomer consists of
  more than two molecules of TRAF6; thermodynamic data for TRAF2 strongly suggests
  that it is functionally a trimer (Rawlings et al. 2006). TRAF6 is represented here
  as a trimer, though the extent and significance of TRAF6 oligomerization is unclear.
  Oligomerisation may be assisted by TIFA (TRAF-interacting protein with a FHA domain;
  Takatsuna et al. 2003). '

## Summary

TRAF6 oligomerization is induced by IRAK1. The TRAF6 oligomer consists of more than two molecules of TRAF6; thermodynamic data for TRAF2 strongly suggests that it is functionally a trimer (Rawlings et al. 2006). TRAF6 is represented here as a trimer, though the extent and significance of TRAF6 oligomerization is unclear. Oligomerisation may be assisted by TIFA (TRAF-interacting protein with a FHA domain; Takatsuna et al. 2003).
