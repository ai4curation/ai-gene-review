stable_id: R-HSA-374665
display_name: DCC interaction with SIAH1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Siah-1 binds DCC and promotes its proteolysis via the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. Siah-1 contains an N-terminal RING domain that is involved in proteolysis
  function and a C-terminal sequence that is involved in its oligomerization and binding
  to target proteins, such as DCC.
