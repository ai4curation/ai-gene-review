species: Homo sapiens
summary: RNA polymerase II transcription complexes are susceptible to transcriptional
  stalling and arrest, when extending  nascent transcripts to 30-nt. This susceptibility
  depends on presence on down-stream DNA, the particular DNA-sequence of the template
  and presence of transcription factors. Transcription factor TFIIH remains associated
  to the RNA pol II elongation complex until position +30. At this stage transcription
  elongation factor TFIIS can rescue stalled transcription elongation complexes.  The
  transcription bubble varies between 13- and 22-nt in size.
