summary: Surfactant catabolism by alveolar macrophages plays a small but critical
  part in surfactant recycling and metabolism. Upon ligand binding, granulocyte-macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSF), a heterodimer of alpha (CSF2RA) and
  beta (CSF2RB) subunits, initiates a signalling process that not only induces proliferation,
  differentiation and functional activation of hematopoietic cells but can also determine
  surfactant uptake into alveolar macrophages and its degradation via clathrin-coated
  vesicles. Defects in human CSF2RA can cause pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction
  4 (SMDP4; MIM:300770, aka congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP)), a rare
  lung disorder due to impaired surfactant homeostasis characterised by alveoli filling
  with floccular material. Excessive lipoprotein accumulation in the alveoli results
  in a form of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants (RDS; MIM:267450).
  Suzuki et al. identified a G to A transition in exon 7 of the CSF2RA gene  from
  2 sisters with PAP resulting in a G174R substitution that altered one of 11 potential
  N-glycosylation sites in the CSF2RA protein. The affected sisters expressed only
  a truncated form of CSF2RA. Ligand binding and CSF2-dependent signalling were severely
  reduced, but not abolished (Suzuki et al. 2008).
