display_name: AXIN1 gene expression is inhibited by ESR1 and stimulated by RUNX1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Transciption of the AXIN1 gene, which encodes a component of the beta-catenin
  (CTNNB1) destruction complex, is inhibited by binding of the activated estrogen
  receptor alpha (ESR1) to estrogen response elements in the second intron of AXIN1
  (Chimge et al. 2016).<br>The AXIN1 gene expression is stimulated by cooperative
  binding of RUNX1 and estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) to adjacent RUNX1 binding sites
  and estrogen response elements in the second intron of AXIN1 (Chimge et al. 2016).
