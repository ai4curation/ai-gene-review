  (Ship1) and other proteins involved in Csf1 signaling and Gab2 is phosphorylated
  directly or indirectly by Csf1r (Liu et al. 2001). Inppl1 (Ship2), a homolog of
  Inppd5 (Ship1), also binds Csf1r in response to Cdf1 (Wang et al. 2004). Gab3, a

## Summary

The Pik3r1 (p85alpha) subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is phosphorylated and binds Cbl and Csf1r (van der Geer and Hunter 1991, Reedijk et al. 1992, McGlade et al. 1992, van der Geer and Hunter 1993, Kanagasundaram et al. 1996, Bourette et al. 1997, Husson et al. 1997, Kanagasundaram et al. 1999, Wang et al. 1999, Ota et al. 2000, Faccio et al. 2007, Sampaio et al. 2011).

Shc1 (Shc) interacts with Cbl and Csf1r (Lioubin et al. 1994 Wang et al. 1999). Cbl is constitutively bound to Grb2, Cbl is phosphorylated, and phosphorylated Cbl binds phosphorylated Shc (Wang et al. 1996, Wang et al. 1999). Plcg2 (Plc-gamma2) expressed in the myeloid lineage (Barbosa et al. 2014) binds phosphorylated tyrosine-721 of Csf1r and Plcg2 is phosphorylated in a process that requires the activity of Pi3k (Bourette et al. 1997, Bourgin-Hierle et al. 2008, Jack et al. 2009).
