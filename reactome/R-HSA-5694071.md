display_name: GLO1 dimer:2xZn2+ transforms MGXL and GSH to (R)-S-LGSH
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Lactoylglutathione lyase (GLO1) catalyses the transformation of methylglyoxal
  (MGXL) and glutathione (GSH) to (R)-S-lactoylglutathione ((R)-S-LGSH), an intermediate
  in pyruvate metabolism. MGXL is a reactive 2-oxoaldehyde  byproduct of normal metabolism
  that is a carcinogen and a mutagen (Ridderstrom et al. 1998). This is the first
  step in the glyoxalase system, a critical two-step detoxification system for MGXL.
