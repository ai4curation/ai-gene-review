display_name: ERCC8:DDB1:CUL4:RBX1 ubiquitinates ERCC6 and RNA Pol II
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ubiquitin ligase complex ERCC8:DDB1:CUL4:RBX1 may ubiquitinate ERCC6
  (CSB) (Groisman et al. 2006) at the later steps of TC-NER and may also be required
  in the ubiquitination of the RNA Pol II subunit POLR2A in response to damage (Bregman
  et al. 1996, Lee et al. 2002). Ubiquitination mediated by ERCC8 (CSA) containing
  ubiquitin ligase complex plays an important role in progression and termination
  of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), although the mechanistic
  details are largely unknown.
