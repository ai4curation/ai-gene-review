stable_id: R-HSA-202966
display_name: Caspase mediated cleavage of HIP-55
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HIP-55 is an actin binding SH3 domain protein that is cleaved by caspase-3.
  Cleavage results in  dissociation of the actin-binding domain from the SH3 domain
  and   may alter cell signaling to and from the actin cytoskeleton. In addition,
  this cleavage  may be involved in the the alteration in cell morphology that occur
  during apoptosis (Chen et al., 2001).
