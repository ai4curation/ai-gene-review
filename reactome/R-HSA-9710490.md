display_name: The GSDME gene promoter is hypermethylated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 5-Methylation of cytosine residues in DNA is a heritable epigenetic mark
  that regulates gene expression. DNA methyltransferases (DNA MTase, (DNMTs)) catalyze
  the transfer of the CH3 group from S‑adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to DNA (Melanie
  E & Lacey M 2014; Laisne M et al. 2018). DNMTs associate with EZH2 of the Polycomb
  Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) (Vire et al. 2006). Aberrant promoter methylation is
  considered to be a hallmark of cancer (Ehrlich M et al. 2002; Dong Y et al. 2014;
  Lam K et al. 2016; Croes L et al. 2018). Epigenetic inactivation of GSDME due to
  hypermethylation of the GSDME promoter region has been linked to tumorigenesis (Akino
  K et al. 2007; Kim MS et al. 2008a,b; Croes L et al. 2017, 2018; Ibrahim J et al.
  2019). Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors such as FDA‑approved
  decitabine (5‑aza‑2'‑deoxycytidine or DAC) may elevate GSDME expression in certain
  cancer cells (Akino K et al. 2007; Fujikane T et al. 2009; Wang Y et al. 2017).
