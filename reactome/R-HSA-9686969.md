display_name: APC/C:Cdh1 polyubiquitinates SKP2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RB1-dependent polyubiquitination of SKP2 by the APC/C:Cdh1 complex is an
  important mechanism of RB1-mediated cell cycle exit, which contributes to the RB1
  tumor suppressive role. ABC/C:Cdh1-mediated polyubiquitination targets SKP2 for
  proteasome-mediated degradation. RB1 and APC/C:Cdh1-dependent degradation of SKP2
  allows accumulation of CDKN1B (p27Kip1) in the cell, as CDKN1B is a target of the
  SKP2-containing SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. CDKN1B acts as a CDK inhibitor, enabling
  mitotic exit (Ji et al. 2004, Binne et al. 2007).
