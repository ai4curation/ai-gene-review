summary: 'PTPN12 protein tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylates activated EGFR at tyrosine
  residue Y1148 (Y1148 corresponds to Y1172 in the nascent EGFR sequence which includes
  the 24 amino acid long signal peptide at the N-terminus). PTPN12-mediated dephosphorylation
  of activated EGFR inhibits SHC1 recruitment to the p-Y1148 (i.e. p-Y1172) docking
  site, thus attenuating downstream RAS activation (Sun et al. 2011). The recruitment
  of SHC1 to p-Y1148 (i.e. Y1172) of EGFR is mediated by the N-terminal phosphotyrosine
  interaction domain (PID) of SHC1 (Batzer et al. 1995, Songyang et al. 1995). '
