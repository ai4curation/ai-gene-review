display_name: Mutant MRAS:SHOC2:PPP1CC complexes dephosphorylate inactive RAFs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of RAF occurs in the context of a ternary
  complex consisting of SHOC2 and the RAS protein family member MRAS in its GTP-bound
  form (Rodriguez-Viciano et al, 2006; Young et al, 2013; reviewed in Simanshu et
  al, 2017). Consistent with a role of this ternary complex in promoting RAF signaling,
  activating mutations in SHOC2, MRAS and PP1 are associated with increased RAF pathway
  activity in Noonan syndrome (Cordeddu et al, 2009; Gripp et al, 2016; Motta et al,
  2016; Higgin et al, 2017;  Motta et al, 2019a,b; Young et al, 2018).
