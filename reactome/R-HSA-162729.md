stable_id: R-HSA-162729
display_name: uPAR-acyl-GPI + H2O -> uPAR + long-chain fatty acid
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The fatty acid group added to inositol in the fourth step of GPI biosynthsis
  is removed from GPI-conjugated uPAR. This hydrolysis event occurs in the endoplasmic
  reticulum and appears to be associated with efficient transport of the conjugated
  protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (Tanaka et al. 2004).
