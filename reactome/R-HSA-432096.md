display_name: Activated integrin alphaIIb beta3 binds SHC1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The beta 3 integrin cytoplasmic tail binds SH2-containing protein (SHC),
  an adapter in Ras signaling. Phosphorylation of Y785 may be necessary for binding;
  phosphorylation of T779 inhibits SHC binding. Mice expressing a mutated beta 3 where
  Y773 and Y785 have been mutated to F exhibit rebleeding from tail wounds and subtle
  defects in clot retraction and platelet aggregation.

## Summary

The beta 3 integrin cytoplasmic tail binds SH2-containing protein (SHC), an adapter in Ras signaling. Phosphorylation of Y785 may be necessary for binding; phosphorylation of T779 inhibits SHC binding. Mice expressing a mutated beta 3 where Y773 and Y785 have been mutated to F exhibit rebleeding from tail wounds and subtle defects in clot retraction and platelet aggregation.
