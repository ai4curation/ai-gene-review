stable_id: R-HSA-975857
display_name: TRAF6 binds to hp- IRAK1 or p-IRAK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Hyperphosphorylated IRAK1, still within the receptor complex, binds TRAF6
  through multiple regions including the death domain, the undefined domain and the
  C-terminal C1 domain (Li et al. 2001). The C-terminal region of IRAK-1 contains
  three potential TRAF6-binding sites; mutation of the amino acids (Glu544, Glu587,
  Glu706) in these sites to alanine greatly reduces activation of NFkappaB (Ye et
  al. 2002).
