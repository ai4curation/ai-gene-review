stable_id: R-HSA-193703
display_name: IKKbeta is activated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Atypical PKC isoforms phosphorylate the beta subunit of the IKK complex (on
  Serines 177 and 181) thereby serving as an IKK kinase.  TRAF6 and p62 as well appear
  to have a role in IKK activation. TRAF6 mediates the assembly of K63-linked poly-Ub
  chains required for IKK activation. The ubiquitin binding property of p62 may also
  be relevant in regulating IKK activation.
