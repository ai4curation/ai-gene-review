stable_id: R-HSA-5683588
display_name: ATG10 transfers ATG12 from ATG10 to ATG5
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATG12 is transferred from ATG10, becoming conjugated to the ATG5 at Lys-130
  through an isopeptide bond (Mizushima et al. 1998) that requires no E3-like enzyme.
  Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, mutational analyses and crosslinking experiments
  show that ATG10 directly recognizes ATG5, binding it to place the side chain of
  ATG5 Lys-130 into an optimal orientation for its conjugation reaction with ATG12,
  thereby enabling ATG10 to mediate the formation of the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate without
  a specific E3 enzyme (Yamaguchi et al. 2012).
