display_name: Rheb in the MTORC1 complex hydrolyses GTP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: When cellular energy is depleted AMPK is activated and inhibits mTORC1 via
  phosphorylation of both TSC2 and Raptor (Gwinn et al. 2008). Phosphorylation of
  TSC2 increases its GAP activity on GTP-bound Rheb, enhancing the intrinsic GTPase
  activity of Rheb. Rheb converts its bound GTP to GDP which diminishes its stimulation
  of mTORC1 and thereby decreases mTORC1 kinase activity. AMPK also phosphorylates
  the mTORC1 component RPTOR (Raptor), which promotes its dissociation from the ULK1
  complex. Both effects of AMPK lead to a reduction in S758 phosphorylation on ULK1
  (Shang et al. 2011). The S758-unphosphorylated ULK1 is able to associate with, and
  be activated by, AMPK (Egan et al. 2011).<br><br>This event is positively regulated
  by the phosphorylation of the TSC complex by p-AMPK.
