stable_id: R-MMU-1168790
display_name: ADAM17 cleavage of Ghr
species: Mus musculus
summary: The Growth Hormone Receptor is cleaved by ADAM17 releasing the extracellular
  region as Growth Hormone Binding Protein (Zhang et al. 2000). The precise site of
  cleavage is not clear for mouse, but has been characterized in rabbit as between
  Pro-256 and Phe-257, a site conserved in human (Wang et al. 2002).
