stable_id: R-HSA-5679205
display_name: ULK1 phosphorylates Beclin-1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Following amino-acid starvation or mTOR inhibition, activated ULK1 phosphorylates
  BECN1 (Beclin-1) on Ser-15, thereby enhancing the activity of PIK3C3 (Vps34) in
  the Beclin-1 complex. This phosphorylation is required for full autophagic induction
  in mammals (Russell et al. 2013).

## Summary

Following amino-acid starvation or mTOR inhibition, activated ULK1 phosphorylates BECN1 (Beclin-1) on Ser-15, thereby enhancing the activity of PIK3C3 (Vps34) in the Beclin-1 complex. This phosphorylation is required for full autophagic induction in mammals (Russell et al. 2013).
