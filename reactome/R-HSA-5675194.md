display_name: Activated MAPK phosphorylates RAF1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAF1 is phosphorylated by activated MAPK at 6 serine residues (S29, S43,
  S289, S296, S301 and S642).  MAPK-dependent hyperphosphorylation of RAF1 abrogates
  the ability of activated RAF1 to interact with RAS and is coincident with inactivation
  of RAF1. RAF1 proteins containing mutation of these phosphorylation sites persist
  at the plasma membrane, show sustained S338 phosphorylation and persistent activation
  relative to WT RAF1 protein. In wild type cells, PP2A and the prolyl-isomerase PIN1
  contribute to the dephosphorylation of hyperphosphorylated RAF1, allowing subsequent
  cycles of activation to occur (Dougherty et al, 2005; reviewed in Roskoski, 2010)
