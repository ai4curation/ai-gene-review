display_name: PEBP1 binds activated RAF1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PEBP1, also known as RKIP (Raf kinase inhibitor protein), is a negative regulator
  of RAF1 that binds to the phosphorylated NtA region and prevents activation of MAP2K
  substrates (Yeung et al, 1999; Yeung et al, 2000; Rath et al, 2008; Park et al,
  2006; reviewed in Lorenz et al, 2014).  Relief of this PEBP1 repression of RAF1
  activity is stimulated by phosphorylation of PEBP1, which promotes it dissociation
  from RAF1.  Candidate kinases for phosphorylation of PEBP1 include PKC and the MAPKs
  themselves, which would establish a positive feedback loop stimulating MAPK pathway
  activity (Corbit et al, 2003; Cho et al, 2003; Shin et al, 2009).
