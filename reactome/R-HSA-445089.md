stable_id: R-HSA-445089
display_name: Dephosphorylation of pL1 (Y1176)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: L1 translocated to the non raft membranes of the C-domain is dephosphorylated.
  A number of potential candidate phosphatases exist including phosphotyrosine phosphatases.
  Dephosphorylation of Y1176 allows L1 binding to AP-2, an adaptor required for clathrin
  mediated internalization of L1.

## Summary

L1 translocated to the non raft membranes of the C-domain is dephosphorylated. A number of potential candidate phosphatases exist including phosphotyrosine phosphatases. Dephosphorylation of Y1176 allows L1 binding to AP-2, an adaptor required for clathrin mediated internalization of L1.
