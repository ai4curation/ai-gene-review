display_name: Covalent tyrosine kinase inhibitors bind and inactivate EGFR kinase
  domain mutant dimers resistant to non-covalent tyrosine kinase inhibitors
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Covalent (irreversible) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), pelitinib, WZ4002,
  HKI-272, canertinib and afatinib, form a covalent bond with the EGFR cysteine residue
  C397 and inhibit trans-autophosphorylation of mutants resistant to non-covalent
  TKIs. However, effective concentrations of covalent TKIs also inhibit wild type
  EGFR, resulting in severe side effects. Hence, covalent TKIs have not shown much
  promise as therapeutics.

## Summary

Covalent (irreversible) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), pelitinib, WZ4002, HKI-272, canertinib and afatinib, form a covalent bond with the EGFR cysteine residue C397 and inhibit trans-autophosphorylation of mutants resistant to non-covalent TKIs. However, effective concentrations of covalent TKIs also inhibit wild type EGFR, resulting in severe side effects. Hence, covalent TKIs have not shown much promise as therapeutics.
