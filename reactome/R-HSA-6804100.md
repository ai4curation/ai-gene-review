species: Homo sapiens
summary: High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an ubiquitous nuclear protein that is
  actively secreted by innate immune cells and/or released passively by necrotic or
  damaged cells in response to infection or injury (Andersson U et al. 2000; Scaffidi
  P et al. 2002; Bonaldi T et al. 2003; Chen G et al. 2004; Beyer C et al. 2012; Yang
  H et al. 2013). Outside the cell, HMGB1 can serve as an alarmin to activate innate
  immune responses including chemotaxis and cytokine release in both normal and aberrant
  immunity (Andersson U et al. 2000; Zetterström CK et al. 2002; Voll RE et al. 2008;
  Harris HE et al. 2012; Diener KR et al. 2013; Yang H et al. 2013).<p> HMGB1 can

  ligands such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to potentiate proinflammatory
  response (Youn JH et al. 2008, 2011; Wähämaa H et al. 2011; Hreggvidsdottir HS et
  al. 2009). The activity of HMGB1 depended on the redox state of three cysteines
  at positions 23, 45 and 106 (C23, C45 and C106) (Urbonaviciute V et al. 2009; Venereau
  E et al. 2012, 2013; Yang H et al., 2013, 2021). Analysis revealed that the inflammatory
  activities of HMGB1 required both the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond
  between C23 and C45 and the reduced state of C106 (thiol state, C106-SH) (Venereau

  obtained from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) patients (Wähämaa
