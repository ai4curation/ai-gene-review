display_name: ESR1:ESTG:PGR:P4 bind pioneer factors and coactivators
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Rapid immunoprecipitation by mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins (RIME)
  analysis shows that in addition to interacting with PGR after progesterone stimulation,
  ESR1 also interacts with known co-activators NRIP, GATA3 and TLE3 (Mohammed et al,
  2013; Mohammed et al, 2015). Progesterone treatment of breast cancer cell lines
  under estrogen-rich conditions promotes a redistribution of ER alpha binding to
  PGR binding sites. This redistribution coincides with co-occupancy of FOXA1 and
  EP300 at the novel binding sites as well as with the H3K27Ac mark, suggesting that
  the binding events are functional (Clarke et al, 2012; Mohammed et al, 2015).
