display_name: HTRA2 degrades NDUFA13 (GRIM-19)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HTRA2 (OMI) cleaves NDUFA13 (GRIM-19) at six sites (Kummari et al. 2021).
  Interaction of NDUFA13 with the N-terminus of HTRA2 allosterically activates the
  protease activity of HTRA2 (Kummari et al. 2021). Self-cleavage by HTRA2 releases
  HTRA2 into the cytosol where it activates apoptosis by binding and cleaving inhibitors
  of apoptosis (reviewed in Chakraborty et al. 2022). NDUFA13 acts to promote the
  apoptotic activity of HTRA2 (Ma et al. 2007). The effect of the cleavage of NDUFA13
  on apoptosis is unclear.

Self-cleavage by HTRA2 releases HTRA2 into the cytosol where it activates apoptosis by binding and cleaving inhibitors of apoptosis (reviewed in Chakraborty et al. 2022).
