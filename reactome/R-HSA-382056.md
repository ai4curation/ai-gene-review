stable_id: R-HSA-382056
display_name: Crk binds to the active PDGF receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Crk family of adaptor molecules consists of CrkI with one SH2 and one SH3
  domains and CrkII and CrkL with one SH2 and two SH3 domains each. They bind to Tyr762
  of the PDGF alpha-receptor and represent the only known SH2-domain containing molecule
  which binds with significantly higher affinity to the alpha-receptor than to the
  beta-receptor.
