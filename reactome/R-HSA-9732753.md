## Summary

RAF1, activated downstream of IFNG (interferon-gamma) in a JAK1-dependent and RAS-independent manner, phosphorylates ERKs: MAPK1 (ERK2) and MAPK3 (ERK1) (Sakatsume et al. 1998). IFNG-mediated activation of ERKs may contribute to transient attenuation of TGF-beta signaling through ERK-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3, but a long-term effect depends on IFNG-mediated transcription of SMAD7, an inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling (Ulloa et al. 1999).
