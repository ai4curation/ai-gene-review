display_name: MITF-M-dependent miR-211 expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MIR211, encoding the microRNA miR-211 is an MITF-M-dependent target gene
  that is expressed in the melanocyte lineage and is frequently downregulated in melanoma
  (Hunter et al, 1998; Duncan et al, 1998; Duncan et al, 2001). The MIR211 gene falls
  in intron 6 of TRPM1, itself a direct MITF-M target, making MIR211 an co-transcriptional
  target (Miller et al, 2004; Miller et al, 2005; Strub et al, 2011). Both TRPM1 and
  miR-211 have been proposed as regulators of melanogenesis, but the precise roles
  played by each have not been clearly defined (Miler et al, 2004; Miller et al, 2005;
  Levy et al, 2010; Boyle et al, 2011; Margue et al, 2013; De Luca et al, 2016; reviewed
  in Goding and Arnheiter, 2019)<br>Genes regulated by miR-211 have diverse functions
  and disruption of expression of some of these target genes affects the invasiveness
  of melanoma cell lines (Levy et al, 2010; Boyle et al, 2011; Margue et al, 2013;
  De Luca et al, 2016). One miR-211 target is the transcription factor POU3F2 (also
  known as BRN2) which has been implicated in the regulation of MITF-M, establishing
  a feedback loop (Boyle et al, 2011; reviewed in Goding and Arnheiter, 2019; Fane
  et al, 2019).
