display_name: Oligomerization of BCL10 and MALT1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BCL10 and MALT1 proteins form high molecular weight oligomers and only these
  oligomeric forms can activate IKK in vitro (Sun et al. 2004). BCL10 proteins form
  homo-oligomers through CARD-CARD interactions whereas in MALT1 the tandem Ig-like
  domains naturally form oligomers with a tendency towards dimers and tetramers (Dong
  et al. 2006, Quiu & Dhe-Paganon 2011). These CBM oligomers provides the molecular
  platform, which can facilitate dimerization or serve as scaffolds on which proteases
  and kinases involved in NF-kB activation are assembled and activated.
