summary: 'Once activated, the E3 ligase activity of Parkin (PRKN) catalyzes the assembly
  of mono ubiquitin (Ub) or polyUb chains on a broad range of substrates including
  mitofusin 1 (MFN1) (Tnaka A et al., 2010), MFN2 (Rakovic A et al., 2011; McLelland
  GL et al., 2018; Vranas M et al., 2022), mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM20
  homolog (TOMM20) (Koyano F et al., 2019; Zittlau KI et al., 2022), and voltage dependent
  anion selective channel proteins   (VDAC1) (Geisler S et al., 2010; Ordureau A et
  al., 2018; Ham SJ et al., 2020), VDAC2, VDAC3 (Sun Y et al., 2012). Other PRKN substrates
  identified by the various proteomic studies: Sarraf SA et al., 2013; Ordureau A
  et al., 2014, 2018; Rose CM et al., 2016; Antico O et al., 2021; Zittlau KI et al.,
  2022. PRKN catalyzes the formation of different types of ubiquitin linkages on its
  substrates, including K6, K27, K48, and K63 linkages (Harper JW et al., 2018; Antico
  O et al., 2021; Buneeva O & Medvedev A 2022). Multiple E2 enzymes, including UBE2N,
  UBE2L3 or UBE2D2/3, are implicated in mediating the ubiquitin ligase activity of
  PRKN (Fiesel FC et al., 2014; Geisler S et al., 2014). <p>Conjugated Ub chains on
  mitochondrial proteins mark them either for degradation via the proteasomal pathway
  or recruit cargo receptors such as SQSTM1 and OPTN to initiate mitophagy (Heo LM
  et al. 2015; Lazarou M et al. 2015). Deubiquitinases such as USP15 and USP30 remove
  Ub moieties from the mitochondrial substrates to counteract PRKN-mediated ubiquitination
  and suppress mitophagy (Gersch M et al., 2017; Cornelissen T et al., 2014; reviewed
  by Onishi M et al., 2021). <p>PRKN is a member of the RINGinBetweenRING family of
  E3 Ub ligases, which mediate Ub transfer to a substrate from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzyme through the formation of a thioester intermediate on a reactive cysteine
  (C431 in PRKN) located in the RING2 catalytic domain (Wenzel et al., 2011; reviewed
  by Wang XS et al., 2023). Structural and biochemical studies reveal that at steady
  state PRKN is maintained in an autoinhibited conformation (Trempe JF et al., 2013;
  Kumar A et al., 2015, 2017; Tang MY et al., 2017). PRKN binding to phosphorylated
  Ub moieties at MOM followed by PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of PRKN at S65 release
  the inhibitory interdomain interactions thus promoting the E3 ligase activity of
  PRKN (Iguchi M et al., 2013; Kumar A et al., 2017; Gladkova C et al., 2018; Condos
  TE et al., 2018). In particular, phosphoUb binding induces conformational changes
  in PRKN that lead to the release of the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain allowing PINK1
  to phosphorylate PRKN at S65 within the ULB domain (Kumar A et al., 2015, 2017;
  Kazlauskaite A et al., 2015). This phosphorylation of PRKN, in turn, liberates the
  RING1 domain from the repressor element of Parkin (REP), enabling recruitment of
  E2 enzyme. Ub conjugates to the binding site on RING1, and enhances reactivity of
  the catalytic C431 residue in RING2 (Iguchi M et al., 2013; Caulfield TR et al.,
  2014; Ordureau A et al., 2015; Sauve V et al., 2015, 2018; Tang MY et al., 2017;
  Gladkova C et al., 2018). PRKN-mediated ubiquitination of MOM proteins generates
  more Ub moieties for PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ub thus leading to a feedforward
  loop in the PINK1:PRKN pathway (Ordureau A et al., 2015; Sauve V et al., 2022).
  <p>This Reactome event shows PRKN-mediated K63-linked and K48-linked ubiquitination
  of the selected MOM proteins such as MFN1, MFN2, TOMM20, VDAC13 in the presence
  of Ub-conjugating E2 enzymes.'
