stable_id: R-HSA-2900756
display_name: NOTCH1 HD+PEST domain mutants bind JAG2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: It has not been directly demonstrated that JAG2 binds to and activates NOTCH1
  HD (heterodimerization) domain mutants, but NOTCH1 HD domain mutants and in cis
  HD and PEST domain mutants of NOTCH1 are expected to respond to JAG2 like NOTCH1
  HD domain mutants response to DLL1 (Malecki et al. 2006).
