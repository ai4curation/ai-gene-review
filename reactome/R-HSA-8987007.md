stable_id: R-HSA-8987007
display_name: p-STAT1 dimerizes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1alpha/beta (STAT1) is believed
  to dimerize after it dissociates from the Interleukin-24 (IL24) receptor complex.  This
  is a black box event because dimerization is inferred from STAT1 dimerization in
  response to Interferon gamma (IFNG) (Wehinger et al. 1996) and the observed translocation
  of STAT1 to the nucleus in response to IL24 (Parrish-Novak et al. 2002).
