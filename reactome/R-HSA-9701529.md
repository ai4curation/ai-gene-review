stable_id: R-HSA-9701529
display_name: p-Y705, p-S727 STAT3 dimer translocates to the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After phosphorylation of Y705 (and in some cases, of S727 in an independent
  event), STAT3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to its cognate
  TTCN(2-4)GGAA site in the promoter of target genes. STAT3-mediated gene expression
  contributes to cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival (reviewed in
  Yu et al, 2014; Guanizo et al, 2018).

## Summary

After phosphorylation of Y705 (and in some cases, of S727 in an independent event), STAT3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to its cognate TTCN(2-4)GGAA site in the promoter of target genes. STAT3-mediated gene expression contributes to cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival (reviewed in Yu et al, 2014; Guanizo et al, 2018).
