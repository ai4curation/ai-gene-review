stable_id: R-HSA-453111
display_name: Phosphorylated SHC recruits GRB2:SOS1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Shc is tyrosine phosphorylated by an unidentified kinase, creating a docking
  site for the SH2 domain of Grb2 (Zhu et al. 1994). Grb2 is an adaptor protein believed
  to be constitutively associated with the guanine nucleotide exchange protein Sos1
  (often abbreviated to Sos). Recruitment of the Grb2:Sos1 complex leads to activation
  of the Ras pathway (Ravichandran & Burakoff 1994) and consequently activation of
  the MAPK pathway.
