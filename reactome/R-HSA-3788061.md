## Summary

ADAM8 can cleave fibronectin in human cartilage extracts at Ala271/Val272, within a linker region between the fifth and sixth type I domains, producing  ?30-kd and ?50–85-kd fragments with distinctive neoepitopes VRAA271 and 272VYQP that are associated with osteoarthritis (Zack et al. 2006, 2009).
