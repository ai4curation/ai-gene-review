display_name: HFE binds TFRC dimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Transferrin, in dimeric form (TFRC dimer), mediates cellular uptake of transferrin-bound
  iron in a non-iron dependent manner. Hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE) binds
  to TFRC dimer and reduces its affinity for iron-loaded transferrin (Feder et al.
  1998).
