stable_id: R-HSA-190260
display_name: FGFR2b binds to FGF
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In this reaction, FGF receptor 2b in the plasma membrane binds an associating
  extracellular ligand, a requisite step for subsequent activation. The resulting
  complex consists of dimerized receptor, two ligand molecules, and heparan sulfate.
  Two isoforms of FGFR2b generated by alternative splicing and differing only by the
  presence ("long") or absence ("short") of two amino acid residues at positions 428-429
  are equally active in ligand binding and dimerization but differ in their abilities
  to interact with downstream targets.

## Summary

In this reaction, FGF receptor 2b in the plasma membrane binds an associating extracellular ligand, a requisite step for subsequent activation. The resulting complex consists of dimerized receptor, two ligand molecules, and heparan sulfate. Two isoforms of FGFR2b generated by alternative splicing and differing only by the presence ("long") or absence ("short") of two amino acid residues at positions 428-429 are equally active in ligand binding and dimerization but differ in their abilities to interact with downstream targets.
