summary: Active RAB6 contributes to the recruitment of the Golgi-associated retrograde

  vesicles from the early endosome (Liewen et al, 2005; reviewed in Bonifacino and
  Hierro, 2011).  Typical cargo of these vesicles includes resident TGN proteins such
  as TGOLN2 (also known as TGN46) and internalized Shiga toxin subunit B (STx-B) and
  cholera toxin (Perez-Victoria et al, 2008; Ganley et al 2008; Pusapati et al, 2012;
  reviewed in Pfeffer, 2011; Liu and Storrie, 2012). Two studies have identifed RAB43
