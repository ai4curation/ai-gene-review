stable_id: R-HSA-5654163
display_name: Activated FGFR4 binds PLCG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Recruitment of PLC-gamma by FGF receptors has been best studied in FGFR1c
  signaling, where it has been shown that autophosphorylation of Tyr766 in the C-terminal
  tail of FGFR1c creates a specific binding site for the SH2 domain of PLC-gamma.  A
  mutant FGFR1c in which Y766 is replaced by phenylalanine is unable to activate PI
  hydrolysis and Ca2+ release in response to FGF stimulation. Membrane recruitment
  of PLC-gamma is also aided by binding of the Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of
  this enzyme to PtIns(3,4,5) P3 molecules that are generated in response to PI-3
  kinase stimulation.  By sequence comparison, Y766 is conserved in all FGFR isoforms,
  and PLC-gamma signaling is observed, to a greater or lesser extent, downstream of
  all FGFR receptors upon stimulation with FGFs.
