display_name: PDCL promotes G-protein beta 5 folding
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PDCL (PhLP1) increases stability of the G-protein beta 5 subunit (GNB5),
  presumably by assisting with the proper folding of GNB5, but does not release folded
  GNB5 from the TRiC/CCT chaperonin (Howlett et al. 2009).
