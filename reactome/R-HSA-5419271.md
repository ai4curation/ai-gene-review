stable_id: R-HSA-5419271
display_name: 55S ribosome:MTRF1L hydrolyzes peptidyl-tRNA bond and GTP is hydrolyzed
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Binding of the MTRF1L (MTRF1a) termination factor triggers hydrolysis of
  the peptidyl-tRNA bond by the 39S subunit of the ribosome and release of the translated
  polypeptide (Soleimanpour-Lichaei et al. 2007, Nozaki et al. 2008, reviewed in Christian
  and Spremulli 2012). MTRF1L hydrolyzes GTP during the reaction. Stalled ribosomes
  are rescued by binding of an ICT1 protein in addition to the ICT1 subunit integrated
  in the 39S subunit (Richter et al. 2010, Akabane et al. 2014).
