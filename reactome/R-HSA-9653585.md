display_name: S-Farn-Me KRAS4B binds calmodulin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: KRAS4B, unique among RAS isoforms, has been shown to bind to calmodulin (Villalonga
  et al, 2001; Lopez-Alcala et al, 2008). This interaction is thought to decrease
  the affinity of KRAS4B for the plasma membrane (Fivaz and Meyer, 2005; Sidhu et
  al, 2003; reviewed in Ahearn et al, 2018; Nussinov et al, 2015).  Interaction between
  oncogenic KRAS4B and calmodulin has been shown to promote tumorigenesis by interfering
  with the activation of CAMK2. This in turn relieves the suppression of beta-catenin
  dependent signaling mediated by the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway (Wang et
  al, 2015).<br>The interaction between KRAS4B and calmodulin is inhibited by PKC-
  or PRKG2-dependent KRAS4B phosphorylation at serine 181 (Wang et al, 2015; Alvarez-Moya
  et al, 2010; reviewed in Ahearn et al, 2018).
