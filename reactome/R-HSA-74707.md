stable_id: R-HSA-74707
display_name: Binding of IRS to insulin receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Using receptor mutagenesis studies it is known that IRS1 via its PTB domain
  binds to the insulin receptor at the juxtamembrane region at tyrosine 972. The interaction
  is further stabilized by the PH domain of IRS1 which interacts with the phospholipids
  of the plasma membrane. This allows the receptor to phosphorylate IRS1 on up to
  13 of its tyrosine residues (Tavare and Denton 1998, Duan et al.2004).
