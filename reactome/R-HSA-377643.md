display_name: Dephosphorylation of inactive SRC by PTPB1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The integrin alphaIIb beta3:Inactive SRC complex recruits PTP1B protein tyrosine
  phosphatase resulting in the dephosphorylation of SRC tyrosine 530. The phosphorylated
  tail of SRC tail interacts with the SH2 domain thereby repressing kinase activity;
  removal of phosphorylation activates SRC kinase activity.

## Summary

The integrin alphaIIb beta3:Inactive SRC complex recruits PTP1B protein tyrosine phosphatase resulting in the dephosphorylation of SRC tyrosine 530. The phosphorylated tail of SRC tail interacts with the SH2 domain thereby repressing kinase activity; removal of phosphorylation activates SRC kinase activity.
