species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated CARD9 localised in lipid rafts may self-associate with other CARD9
  molecules (oligomerization). Residues 140-420 of CARD9 contain heptad repeats characteristic
  of coiled-coil structures that function in protein oligomerization (Bertin et al.
  2000).

## Summary

Activated CARD9 localised in lipid rafts may self-associate with other CARD9 molecules (oligomerization). Residues 140-420 of CARD9 contain heptad repeats characteristic of coiled-coil structures that function in protein oligomerization (Bertin et al. 2000).
