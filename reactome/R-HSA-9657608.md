summary: Single mechanism MAPK inhibitors such as ulixertinib and ravoxertinib bind
  to the activated forms of MAPK proteins and inhibit their intrinsic target-directed
  kinase activity (Germann et al, 2017; Blake et al, 2016; reviewed in Samatar and

## Summary

Single mechanism MAPK inhibitors such as ulixertinib and ravoxertinib bind to the activated forms of MAPK proteins and inhibit their intrinsic target-directed kinase activity (Germann et al, 2017; Blake et al, 2016; reviewed in Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014).
