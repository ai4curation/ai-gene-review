display_name: Exocytosis of azurophil granule lumen proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Azurophil or primary granules were originally defined by their high content
  of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and their affinity for the basic dye azure A (Spicer &
  Hardin 1969). Azurophil granules are generally described as spherical. Like lysosomes,
  they contain CD63 in their membrane (Cham et al. 1994) but are regarded as specialized
  secretory granules rather than lysosomes (Cieutat et al. 1998). Azurophil granules
  undergo limited exocytosis in response to stimulation (Sengelov et al. 1993, Faurschou  et
  al. 2002), their primary role is believed to be killing and degradation of engulfed
  microbes in the phagolysosome (Joiner et al. 1989).


  MPO reacts with H2O2 formed by NADPH oxidase, increasing its toxicity by formation
  of hypochlorous acid and other chlorination products, tyrosine radicals and reactive
  nitrogen intermediates which attack the surface of microbes (Klebanoff et al. 2013).

## Summary

Azurophil or primary granules were originally defined by their high content of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and their affinity for the basic dye azure A (Spicer & Hardin 1969).
