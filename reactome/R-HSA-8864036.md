species: Homo sapiens
summary: Protein tyrosine phosphatase PTNP12 dephosphorylates activated PDFRB (PDGF
  receptor beta) at tyrosine residue Y1021, which contributes to the tumor suppressor
  role of PTPN12 in triple negative breast cancer in addition to PTPN12-mediated dephosphorylation
  of ERBB2 (HER2) at Y1248 (Sun et al. 2011).
