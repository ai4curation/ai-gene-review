stable_id: R-HSA-418874
display_name: Recruitment and activation of N-WASP by Cdc42
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The adaptor protein Nck-1 binds to DCC and recruits Rac-1, Cdc42 and their
  effectors PAK-1 and N-WASP to the activated receptor. Both Cdc42 and Nck-1 are activators
  of N-WASP. Cdc42 in its active GTP bound form binds to the CRIB domain of N-WASP
  and this interaction along with PIP2 results in the activation of N-WASP. Nck-1
  activate N-WASP via binding of its SH3 domain to the proline rich domain of N-WASP.
  Nck-1 also possess an SH2 domain that associates directly with activated tyrosine
  kinase receptors which can phosphorylate N-WASP.
