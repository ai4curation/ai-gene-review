stable_id: R-HSA-1462039
display_name: Pro-HNP1-4 are cleaved to biologically active defensin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Synthesis of alpha defensins takes place in neutrophil precursor cells, the
  promyelocytes, in the bone marrow. Pro HNP1-4 are cleaved in the Golgi body, with
  HNP-2 being derived from cleavage of the N-terminal amino acid from HNP-1 or HNP-3.
  The defensin propiece is not only important for correct sub-cellular trafficking
  and sorting but also inhibits HNP activity (Valore et al. 1996, Wu et al. 2007).
  The resulting mature peptides are sorted to primary neutrophil (azurophil) granules
  for storage (Valore & Ganz 1992, Harwig et al. 1992, Cowland & Borregaard).
