display_name: Recruitment of VAV to p-SLP-76
species: Homo sapiens
summary: VAV an activator of RAC-GTPases, is redistributed to plasma membrane and
  is phosphorylated following engagement of FCERI. Phosphorylated SLP-76 tyrosines
  Y113 and Y128 (112Y and 128Y in mouse) provide binding sites for the SH2 domains
  of VAV. The binding of VAV to these phosphotyrosine residues may link SLP-76 to
  the Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and the actin cytoskeleton (Kettner
  et al. 2003).<br>In addition to its known role as guanine nucleotide exchange factor
  (GEF), VAV also modulates cytokine production in mast cells. VAV1-deficient bone
  marrow-derived mast cells exhibited reduced degranulation and cytokine production
  and calcium release in addition of reduced activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
  1 (JNK1), although tyrosine phosphorylation of FCERI, SYK and LAT was normal (Manetz
  et al. 2001, Arudchandran et al. 2000, Song et al. 1999).
