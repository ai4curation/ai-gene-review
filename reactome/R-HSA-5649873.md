display_name: PARP1,PARP2 dimers and FEN1 bind POLB and displace APEX1 from damaged
  AP site
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Homodimers and/or heterodimers of PARP1 and PARP2 bind single strand DNA
  (ssDNA) ends along with FEN1 (flap endonuclease), forming a ternary complex with
  POLB (DNA polymerase beta) and simultaneously displacing APEX1 (Prasad et al. 2001,
  Lavrik et al. 2001, Cistulli et al. 2004). While PARP2 is much less catalytically
  active than PARP1 in DNA damage-induced poly(ADP-ribosyl) (PAR) synthesis (Shieh
  et al. 1998, Ame et al. 1999, Fisher et al. 2007), the functional redundancy between
  PARP1 and PARP2 is probably important. Knockout of both PARP1 and PARP2 homologs
  is embryonic lethal in mice, while knockout of individual PARPs is not (Menissier
  de Murcia et al. 2003). '
