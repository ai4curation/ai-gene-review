display_name: EML4 recruits NUDC to mitotic spindle
species: Homo sapiens
summary: EML4 binds to NUDC and recruits it to the kinetochores of the mitotic spindle.
  The interaction involves the WD40 repeats of EML4 and the C-terminus of NUDC (Chen
  et al. 2015). Knockdown of EML4 produces similar mitotic defects as the knockdown
  of NUDC. The knockdown of either of these two genes frequently results in post-mitotic
  cell death, due to activation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint (Chen et al. 2015,
  Adib et al. 2019). It is uncertain if PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of NUDC precedes
  its binding to EML4.
