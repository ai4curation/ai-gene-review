display_name: SARS-CoV-1 SUMO1-K62-p-S177-N dimer binds to 14-3-3 proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SARS-CoV-1 nucleoprotein (N) was found to coimmunoprecipitate with proteins
  binding to a 14-3-3 β antibody that recognized all the 14-3-3 isoforms. The binding
  was significantly reduced in the presence of kinase inhibitors, indicating that
  phosphorylation of N is necessary. Binding to 14-3-3 retains N in the cytosol (Surjit
  et al, 2005).
