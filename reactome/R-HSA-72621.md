summary: The mRNA-bound ribosomal complex moves along the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR)
  of the mRNA from its initial site to the initiation codon to form a 48S complex,
  in which the initiation codon (AUG) is base paired to the anticodon of the Met-tRNAi.  It
  is not known whether eIF4A (or another ATPase, such as DED1) facilitates scanning
  by melting mRNA secondary structures or by actively propelling the ribosome.
