stable_id: R-HSA-5654422
display_name: Activated FGFR4 binds FRS2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FRS2 (also known as FRS2alpha) is broadly expressed in adult and fetal tissues.  Membrane-bound
  FRS2 interacts with FGFR as a first step in the phosphorylation of this docking
  protein.  The juxtamembrane binding site for FRS2 does not contain tyrosine, so
  binding may be independent of receptor activation and/or constitutive.  Activation
  of the FGFR receptor is required for FRS2 phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment
  of downstream effectors.
