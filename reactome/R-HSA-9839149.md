display_name: AFG3L2 binds mitochondrial matrix proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AFG3L2 (m-AAA+) is a hexameric zinc metalloprotease that is anchored in the
  mitochondrial inner membrane and protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix (Koppen
  et al. 2007, Puchades et al. 2019). AFG3L2 is able to assemble as homohexamers or
  as heterohexamers with its paralog SPG7 (Paraplegin) (Atorino et al. 2003). Each
  AFG3L2 subunit has a membrane-proximal ATPase domain that unfolds proteins and a
  membrane-distal protease domain (Puchades et al. 2019). The substrate protein threads
  through the ATPase spiral of the AFG3L2 hexamer (Puchades et al. 2019) and is processively
  translocated and degraded in an ATP-dependent manner. AFG3L2 binds, unfolds, and
  degrades mitochondrial matrix proteins, including steroidogenic acute regulatory
  protein (STAR) (Bahat et al. 2014), the ribosomal subunit MRPL32 (Koppen et al.
  2007, Ding et al. 2018), and the peripheral inner membrane protein ATP5F1A (Cesnekova
  et al. 2018).<br>Mutations in AFG3L2 have been linked with development of spinocerebellar
  ataxia type 28 (SCA28), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease (Tulli et
  al. 2019).
