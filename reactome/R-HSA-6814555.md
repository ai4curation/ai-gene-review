display_name: Integrator complex processes the 3' end of snRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Transcription of the pre-snRNA extends through a conserved region, the 3'
  box, and terminates downstream. The heterodimeric subunits INTS9 and INTS11 within
  the Integrator complex form an endoribonuclease that cleaves the pre-snRNA at a
  location 5' to the 3' box (Baillat et al. 2005, Abrecht and Wagner 2012, Skaar et
  al. 2015), releasing the capped snRNA bound to the cap binding complex. Factors
  that bind the 5' cap of the pre-snRNA enhance processing at the 3' end (Hallais
  et al. 2013) and polyadenlyation factors PCF11 and SKU72 are required for transcription
  termination (O'Reilly et al. 2014). The remainder of the transcript downstream of
  the cleavage site is presumably degraded by exoribonuclease.
