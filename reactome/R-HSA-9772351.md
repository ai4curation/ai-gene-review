display_name: Disassembly of the Intron Lariat Spliceosome (new)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DHX15 (the homolog of yeast Prp43) hydrolyzes ATP (Studer et al. 2020) and
  translocates along U6 snRNA (inferred from yeast Prp43 in Toroney et al. 2019) to
  release the lariat intron from the Intron Lariat Spliceosome (ILS) (Yoshimoto et
  al. 2009). TFIP11 (homolog of yeast Ntr1) and GCFC2 (C2ORF3, homolog of yeast Ntr2)
  bind and stimulate DHX15 activity (Wen et al. 2008, Yoshimoto et al. 2014). The
  disassembly process is observed as a shift from the ILS to the Intron Small complex.,
  which contains the lariat intron and some undefined proteins (Yoshimoto et al. 2009).
  The PRP19-CDC5L complex (NTC), the PRP19-CDC5L related complex (NTR), the U5 snRNP,
  U2 12S snRNP, and U6 snRNA are released and reused in subsequent splicing reactions
  (Yoshimoto et al. 2009).The intron lariat is debranched (linearized) by the 2'-5'
  phosphodiesterase DBR1 (Kataoka et al. 2013) and then degraded by specific decay
  machineries.
