display_name: Annealing of 3'-end of unwound transfer RNA primer with genomic RNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Retroviruses use cellular tRNAs as primers for reverse transcription of the
  viral genomic RNA (Mak and Kleiman 1997). The primer tRNA is selectively packaged
  during assembly of retrovirus particles. In the case of HIV-1, lysine tRNAs are
  preferentially incorporated during retroviral packaging, and lysine tRNA 3, the
  specific isoacceptor form that serves as a primer for reverse transcription, anneals
  to the PBS (primer binding site) within the U5 region of the viral genomic RNA.
  This association appears to be mediated by the viral reverse transcriptase (RT)
  protein, possibly its "thumb" and "connection" domains (Jiang et al. 1993; Mak et
  al. 1994; Mishima and Steitz 1995).
