stable_id: R-HSA-5419264
display_name: MTRF1L (MTRF1a) or ICT1 binds stop codon in 55S ribosome:mRNA:peptidyl-tRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MTRF1L (mtRF1a) binds the stop codons UAA and UAG of the mRNA when they are
  in the A site of the ribosome (Soleimanpour-Lichaei 2007, Nozaki et al. 2008). (The
  UGA codon is recognized by the tryptophan tRNA in mitochondrial translation.) ICT1
  can also bind standard stop codons in the A-site (inferred from pig mitochondrial
  ribosomes in Akabane et al. 2014).
