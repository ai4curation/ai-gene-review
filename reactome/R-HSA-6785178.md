display_name: LMF1,2 transport LIPC dimer from ER lumen to extracellular region
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Hepatic triacylglycerol lipase (LIPC, and lipoprotein lipase, LPL) are dimeric
  lipases (Hill et al. 1997) that hydrolyse triglycerides from circulating lipoproteins
  thereby playing important roles in lipoprotein remodeling and uptake. LIPC dimer
  (as well as LPL dimer) binds to an ER membrane protein known as lipase maturation
  factor 1 (LMF1) which can mediate secretion and enzymatic maturation of these lipases.
  Human LMF1 contain five TM segments that divide the protein into six separate domains
  with cytoplasmic and ER lumenal orientation thereby transporting LIPC dimer from
  ER lumen to the cytosol. The mechanism of LIPC dimer translocation from cytosol
  to secretion is unknown (Babilonia-Rosa & Neher 2014). Another family member, LMF2,
  may function as LMF1 based on similarity. Defects in LMF1 can cause combined lipase
  deficiency (CLD; MIM:246650), characterised by hypertriglyceridemia caused by ER
  retention of both LIPC dimer and LPL dimer (Peterfy et al. 2007).

## Summary

Hepatic triacylglycerol lipase (LIPC, and lipoprotein lipase, LPL) are dimeric lipases (Hill et al. 1997) that hydrolyse triglycerides from circulating lipoproteins thereby playing important roles in lipoprotein remodeling and uptake. LIPC dimer (as well as LPL dimer) binds to an ER membrane protein known as lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1) which can mediate secretion and enzymatic maturation of these lipases. Human LMF1 contain five TM segments that divide the protein into six separate domains with cytoplasmic and ER lumenal orientation thereby transporting LIPC dimer from ER lumen to the cytosol. The mechanism of LIPC dimer translocation from cytosol to secretion is unknown (Babilonia-Rosa & Neher 2014). Another family member, LMF2, may function as LMF1 based on similarity. Defects in LMF1 can cause combined lipase deficiency (CLD; MIM:246650), characterised by hypertriglyceridemia caused by ER retention of both LIPC dimer and LPL dimer (Peterfy et al. 2007).
