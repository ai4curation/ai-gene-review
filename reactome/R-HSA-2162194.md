display_name: COQ7:COQ9 octamer hydroxylates DMQ10H2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 5-Demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase COQ7 (a.k.a. Clock-1) catalyzes the hydroxylation
  of 6-methoxy-3-methyl-2-decaprenyl-1,4-benzoquinol (DMQ10H2, DMQ) to 3-demethylubiquinol-10
  (DeMQ10H2, DeMQ), using NADH and oxygen. COQ7 forms a heterooctameric complex with
  ubiquinone biosynthesis protein COQ9, a lipid-binding protein presenting the substrate
  to COQ7 activity. In this complex, COQ7 binds two iron ions and forms a heterodimer
  with COQ9, with four of these dimers forming an octameric cage (Vajo et al., 1999;
  Lohman et al., 2014; Manicki et al., 2022). In vitro, COQ9 was found to stimulate
  the activity of COQ7 by 1.5 fold (Nicoll et al., 2024). Both COQ8A,B are required
  for Q10 biosynthesis (Ashraf et al., 2013; Floyd et al., 2016; reviewed in Hojabri
  et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023). This reaction was first studied in yeast (Marbois
  & Clarke, 1996; Tran et al., 2006).
