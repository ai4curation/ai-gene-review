display_name: FIX(29-461) variant is not activated (factor XIa catalyst)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In healthy individuals, conversion of factor IX (FIX) to the activated FIX
  is a calcium-dependent process catalyzed by factor VIIa (FVIIa) in the presence
  of tissue factor and phosphatidyl serine-rich phospholipid (Vadivel K & Bajaj SP
  2012) or by factor XIa (FXIa) in a phospholipid-independent reaction (Wolberg AS
  et al. 1997; Smith SB et al. 2008; Geng Y et al. 2012). Regardless of the activating
  protease, FIX is cleaved first after Arg191 (R191-A192, the α-cleavage) forming
  the intermediate FIX product, then after the residue 226 (R226-V227, the β-cleavage)
  to form the activated FIXa (FIXaβ) (Smith SB et al. 2008; Geng Y et al. 2012; Mohammed
  BM et al. 2018). Deficiency or dysfunction of FIX leads to hemophilia B (HB), an
  X-linked, recessive, bleeding disorder. On a molecular level, HB is due to a heterogeneous
  spectrum of mutations spread throughout the F9 gene (Rallapalli PM et al. 2013).<p>The
  Reactome event describes the defective proteolytic activation of FIX by factor XIa
  due to the presence of HB-associated point mutations R191C, R191H, R226Q and R226W
  in the cleavage sites of FIX (Liddell MB et al. 1989; Monroe DM et al. 1989; Suehiro
  K et al. 1989; Diuguid DL et al. 1989; Bertina RM et al.1990). In addition, naturally
  occurring point mutations in the FIX propeptide sequence such as R43Q, R43L or R46S
  are also annotated here. These FIX variants are secreted into the circulation with
  a mutant 18-amino acid propeptide still attached (Bentley AK et al. 1986; Galeffi
  P & Brownlee GG 1987). The unprocessed FIX variants were found to affect the function
  of the protein by destabilizing the calcium-induced conformation of FIX (Wojcik
  EG et al. 1997) and showed delayed activation by FXIa (Liddell MB et al. 1989; Ware
  J et al. 1989; de la Salle C et al. 1993; Wojcik EG et al. 1997; Bristol JA et al.
  1993).<br><br><br>
