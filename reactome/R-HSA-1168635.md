display_name: PRKCB (PKC-beta) phosphorylates CARMA1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CARMA1 is phosphorylated at serines 559, 644, and 652 by Protein Kinase C
  beta (PKC-beta) (Sommer et al. 2005). CARMA1 is constitutively oligomerized (Tanner
  et al. 2007) and most CARMA1 in unstimulated cells is cytosolic (Sommer et al. 2005,
  Tanner et al. 2007), though a portion is constitutively associated with the plasma
  membrane (Gaide et al. 2002, Sommer et al. 2005). After phosphorylation, CARMA1
  is associated with lipid rafts in the plasma membrane (Sommer et al. 2005). Note
  that some publications refer to CARMA1 with a different N-terminal methionine that
  is 7 amino acids shorter. In this case the phosphorylated serines are 552, 537,
  and 645.
