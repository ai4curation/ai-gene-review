stable_id: R-HSA-210420
display_name: Ca2+ influx through voltage gated Ca2+ channels
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space into the presynaptic neuron through
  the Voltage Gated Ca2+ Channels (VGCC), is dependant on the arrival of an action
  potential at the synaptic bulb. The vesicle fusion and subsequent release of glutamate
  into the synapse is triggered by this influx of Ca2+. The VGCCs involved here could
  be of the N, P/Q or R , and L type.<br>


  Hyperpolarization of the cell membrane due to KIR3 potassium channel activity inhibits
  this influx of Ca2+.'
