species: Homo sapiens
summary: Early studies with the NPM-ALK fusion identified two putative consensus sequences
  for phosphotyrosine binding proteins such as SHC. Coimmunoprecipitation studies
  in NIH 3T3 cells determined that the predominant SHC binding site is at tyrosine
  567 (equivalent to Y1507 in the full length protein). SHC is tyrosine phosphorylated
  and associated with both  NPM-ALK and GRB2 in these cells (Fujimoto et al, 1996).
  SHC has also been demonstrated to be a target of ALK-mediated phosphorylation in
  ALK-amplified neuroblastoma cells (Miyake et al, 2002). Mutation of the Y567 binding
  site to F abrogates the binding of SHC to the fusion protein, but does not eliminate
  the transforming activity of the protein, suggesting that SHC binding is not essential
  to cellular transformation (Fujimoto et al, 1996). SHC has also been shown to bind
  to other ALK fusions, including those with TFG, ATIC and FN1 and to contribute to
  signaling and transformation to various extents (Hernandez et al, 2002; Trinei et
  al, 2000; Ren et al, 2012; Okubo et al, 2012; Cazes et al, 2013reviewed in Hallberg
  and Palmer, 2013; Hallberg and Palmer, 2016; Roskoski, 2013)
