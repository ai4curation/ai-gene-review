display_name: PTPN3 dephosphorylates EPS15
species: Homo sapiens
summary: While the roles of EGFR and EPS15 phosphorylation and ubiquitination are
  not completely clear, recent evidence supports the idea that EGFR-mediated phosphorylation
  of EPS15 promotes the clustering of the activated receptor into clathrin-coated
  pits, while the dephosphorylated EPS15 targets EGFR for endocytosis through a caveolin-and
  lipid raft-dependent route (reviewed in van Bergen en Henegouwen, 2009).  Consistent
  with this, overexpression of the phosphatase PTPN3, which dephosphorylates EPS15
  in vitro and in vivo, promotes the internalization of EGFR into caveolin-enriched
  structures and targets it for lysosomal degradation (Li et al, 2015).
