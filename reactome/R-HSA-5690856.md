display_name: TNFAIP3 (A20) deubiquitinates K63polyUb-RIPK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TNFAIP3 (A20) removes lysine-63 (K63)-linked ubiquitin chains from Receptor
  interacting protein (RIPK1), an essential mediator of the proximal TNF receptor
  1 (TNFR1) signalling complex. The carboxy-terminal domain of A20 then functions
  as a ubiquitin ligase, polyubiquitinating RIPK1 with K48-linked ubiquitin chains,
  thereby targeting RIPK1 for proteasomal degradation (Wertz et al. 2004) which leads
  to termination of TNF- or LPS-mediated activation of NF-kappa-B.
