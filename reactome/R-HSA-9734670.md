display_name: ORC6 binds KPNA1 or KPNA6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ORC6 binds to importin alpha family members KPNA1 and KPNA6, in complex with
  the importin beta (KPNB1). Phosphorylation of ORC6 at threonine residue 195 (T195)
  is not a pre-requisite for binding to KPNA1/KPNA6 although it does facilitate translocation
  of ORC6 to the nucleus (Ghosh et al. 2011).
