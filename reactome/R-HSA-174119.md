stable_id: R-HSA-174119
display_name: Free APC/C phosphorylated by Plk1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation of the APC/C is believed to be required for its activation.
  While the identity of the essential phosphorylation sites and  the kinase(s) responsible  are
  not known with certainty, in vitro studies have shown that the Apc1 and the tetratricopeptide
  repeat (TPR) subunits Cdc27, Cdc16, Cdc23 and Apc7 are phosphorylated and that the
  Cdk1 and Plk1 kinases may play a role.
