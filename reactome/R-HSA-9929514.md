summary: 'CCNA2 contains an evolutionarily conserved consensus CDK1/CDK2 phosphorylation
  site at serine residue S154 (corresponds to S183 in CCNA1) which was shown to be
  phosphorylated upon activation of CCNA2:CDK complexes (Yam et al. 2000: recombinant
  CDK2 was used for in vitro phosphorylation assay) and is used as a readout of activation
  of CCNA:CDK complexes, including CCNA:CDK1 complexes (Pagliuca et al. 2011, Gheghiani
  et al. 2017), although S154 phosphorylation is not needed for the catalytic activity
  of CCNA:CDK complexes per se (Yam et al. 2000).'
