stable_id: R-HSA-5685156
display_name: ATR phosphorylates RPA2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated ATR phosphorylates the RPA2 subunit of the RPA complex on serine
  residue S33. Phosphorylation of RPA2 at S33 likely stimulates additional RPA2 phosphorylation
  on CDK sites (S23 and S29) and DNA-PKcs (PRKDC) sites (S4, S8 and S21). DNA damage-regulated
  phosphorylation of RPA2 plays an important role in the progression of homologous
  recombination-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Anantha et al.
  2007, Liu et al. 2012, Murphy et al. 2014)
