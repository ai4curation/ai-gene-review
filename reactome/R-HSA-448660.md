display_name: IL31:IL31RA:JAK1 binds OSMR:JAK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Interleukin-31 (IL31) signals via a heterodimeric receptor composed of Interleukin-31
  receptor A (IL31RA) and the Oncostatin M receptor (OSMR). IL31 binds first to IL31RA
  (LeSaux et al. 2010). This initial binding is essential for subsequent binding to
  OSMR, possibly because binding induces a conformational change in IL31. The resulting
  IL31:IL31RA complex recruits OSMR, which increases the strength of IL31 binding
  and is essential for subsequent STAT signaling (Diveu et al. 2004, Maier et al.
  2015). As the pre-association of IL31RA with JAK1 is unproven this event is represented
  as a black-box.  '
