display_name: VLDLR binds PCSK9
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Circulating proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is an important
  regulator of plasma cholesterol homeostasis by binding to low-density lipid receptor
  family members and promoting their degradation in lysosomes (Poirier et al. 2008).
  In mice, it was observed that circulating PCSK9 can regulate VLDLR protein levels
  in adipose tissue and thereby, fat accumulation. The absence of PCSK9 led to an
  increase in lipid uptake resulting in adipocyte hypertrophy which was LDLR-independent
  (Roubtsova et al. 2011). Whether increased fat deposition also occurs in humans
  lacking functional PCSK9 remains to be elucidated.
