summary: In addition to ERCC6 (CSB) and the ERCC8 (CSA) ubiquitin ligase complex,

  also participates in global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), is necessary
  for the progression of TC-NER (Furuta et al. 2002). XPA interacts with the GTF2H5
  subunit of the TFIIH complex (Ziani et al. 2014). In GG-NER, XPA loading is accompanied
  by the release of the CAK subcomplex from TFIIH (Coin et al. 2008), but in TC-NER
  the CAK complex remains bound to the TC-NER site (Mourgues et al. 2013).<br>XAB2
  protein exists in the complex with five other proteins, AQR, PRPF19, ZNF830, ISY1
  and PPIE. The XAB2 complex, which is also involved in pre-mRNA splicing, loads onto
  stalled RNA Pol II site (Kuraoka et al. 2008) through the interaction of XAB2 with
  RNA Pol II, ERCC6, ERCC8 and XPA (Nakatsu et al. 2000). The AQR (aquarius) subunit
  of the XAB2 complex is an RNA-DNA helicase that processes R-loops. An R-loop is
  a structure formed by hybridization of a nascent mRNA with a DNA template. In the
  absence of AQR, TC-NER machinery processes R-loops into double strand breaks (Sollier
  et al. 2014).<br>TCEA1 (TFIIS) is a transcription elongation factor that facilitates
  partial digestion of the 3' protruding end of the nascent transcript by a stalled
  RNA Pol II, which is generated during the reverse translocation of RNA Pol II from
  the damage site, and allows the resumption of RNA synthesis once the DNA damage
  is removed (Donahue et al. 1994).<br>HMGN1, a non-histone high mobility group N
  nucleosome-binding protein, was reported to facilitate TC-NER probably by increasing
  accessibility of damaged DNA to repair machinery (Birger et al. 2003), but another
  study found that HMGN1 was not essential for human TC-NER (Apelt et al. 2020).<br>UVSSA
  protein forms a complex with ubiquitin protease USP7. It is recruited to TC-NER
  sites via interaction with ubiquitinated RNA Pol II and ERCC6. The UVSSA:USP7 complex
  stabilizes ERCC6, preventing its proteasome-mediated degradation prior to TC-NER
  completion, and may de-ubiquitinate RNA Pol II after TC-NER is completed, to allow
  resumption of RNA synthesis (Nakazawa et al. 2012, Schwertman et al. 2012, Zhang
  et al. 2012, Fei and Chen 2012).
