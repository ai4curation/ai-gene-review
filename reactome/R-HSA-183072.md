stable_id: R-HSA-183072
display_name: EGFR non-clathrin mediated endocytosis
species: Homo sapiens
summary: At higher concentrations of ligand, a substantial fraction of the receptor
  (>50%) is endocytosed through a clathrin independent, lipid-raft-dependent route
  as the receptor becomes Y1069 (i.e. Y1045 in the mature protein) phosphorylated
  and ubiquitnated. Eps15 and Epsin are found in caveolae. Eps15 and Epsin are immunoprecipated
  with the EGF receptor. Non-clathrin internalization of ubiquitinated EGFR depends
  on its interaction with proteins harbouring the UIM Ub-interacting motif, as shown
  through the ablation of three Ub-interacting motif-containing proteins, Eps15, Eps15R
  and Epsin.
