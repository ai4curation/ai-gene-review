stable_id: R-HSA-177935
display_name: SHP2 dephosphorylates Tyr 992 on EGFR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The tyrosine-protein phosphatase SHP2 is a positive effector of EGFR signalling.
  SHP2 inhibits the tyrosine-dependent translocation of RasGAP (catalyses Ras inactivation)
  to the plasma membrane, thereby keeping it away from Ras-GTP (its substrate). This
  inhibition is achieved by the dephosphorylation of a RasGAP binding site on the
  EGF receptor.

SHP2 inhibits the tyrosine-dependent translocation of RasGAP (catalyses Ras inactivation) to the plasma membrane, thereby keeping it away from Ras-GTP (its substrate).
