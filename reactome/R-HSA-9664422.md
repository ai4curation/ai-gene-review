species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Fc gamma receptors (FCGRs) have been reported to facilitate Leishmania
  internalization, especially when in its amastigote form (Ueno et al. 2012). Following
  cell-to-cell propagation within an established infection or reinfection of a previously
  infected host, the IgG produced by the host covers the surface of Leishmania amastigote
  parasites, making them more susceptible to phagocytosis through FCGRs (Polando et
  al. 2013).<br><br>Classically, phagocytosis via FCGRs has been associated with the
  subsequent activation of Rac GTPases and Cdc42 which in turn activate the phagocyte's
  NADPH oxidase, contributing to the activation of killing mechanisms (Ueno et al.
  2012).
