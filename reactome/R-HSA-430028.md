display_name: Exosome Complex hydrolyzes mRNA by 3' to 5' exoribonuclease digestion
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The exosome complex hydrolyzes capped, deadenylated mRNA from 3' to 5' and
  yields ribonucleotides having 5'-monophosphates. In yeast the Ski2-Ski3-Ski8 complex
  assists degradation by the exosome complex, however little is known about the function
  of the homologous Ski complex in mammals. Although many exosomal components contain
  exonuclease signatures, only two components have been shown to degrade RNA.  Rrp6/PMSCL-100
  has been shown to be involved in the 3’-5’ decay of nuclear mRNAs in yeast.  Rrp6
  may also function in the absence of the core exosomal components. The Rrp44/dDis3
  component of the core exosome has been shown to possess both 3’-5’ exonuclease activity
  along with endonuclease activity via its PIN domain.
