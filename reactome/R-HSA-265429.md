stable_id: R-HSA-265429
display_name: THBS1 (Thrombospondin-1) binds Integrin alpha3beta1, alpha4beta1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The alpha3beta1 integrin is localized in cell-cell junctions of endothelial
  cells and this integrin is involved in regulating angiogenesis by interacting with
  thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). Alpha4beta1 integrin binds to the N-terminal pentraxin
  modules of TSP1 and stimulates chemotaxis and modulates T cell behavior both positively
  and negatively.
