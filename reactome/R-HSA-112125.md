display_name: Oxidative dealkylation of 1-EtA damaged DNA by ABH3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ALKBH3, a homolog of E.coli AlkB (Trewick et al. 2002), removes the ethyl
  group from 1-ethyladenine (1-etA) in a reaction dependent on alpha-ketoglutarate,
  oxygen and Fe2+. ALKBH3 directly reverses alkylating damage of DNA in the form of
  1-etA, releasing acetaldehyde (Duncan et al. 2002). The reversal of alkylating damage
  of dsDNA by ALKBH3 requires the presence of DNA helicase ASCC3, a component of the
  activating signal co-activator complex (Dango et al. 2011). ALKBH3 can also repair
  methylated RNA (Aas et al. 2003).
