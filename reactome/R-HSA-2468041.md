summary: 'CDCA5 (Sororin) is essential for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion
  in mammalian cells (Rankin et al. 2005) in the S-phase of the cell cycle (Nishiyama
  et al. 2010). Several factors contribute to the recruitment of CDCA5 to chromatin-associated
  cohesin: DNA replication (i.e. presence of two sister chromatids), association of
  cohesin complex with PDS5, and acetylation of the SMC3 cohesin subunit by ESCO1/ESCO2
  acetyltransferases. Experiments in which a recombinant tagged mouse CDCA5 was expressed
  in human HeLa cell line showed that CDCA5 starts to accumulate on chromatin in S-phase
  and dissociates from chromosomal arms in prophase (Nishiyama et al. 2010). <br><br>
  CDCA5 is essential for the establishment of chromosomal cohesion only in the presence
  of WAPAL, suggesting that the key role of CDCA5 (Sororin) is to antagonize WAPAL.
  Both CDCA5 and WAPAL contain an FGF (phenylalanine-glycine-phenylalanine) motif
  that is essential for PDS5 binding and is also essential for CDCA5 function in cohesion
  establishment. Indeed, CDCA5 is able to displace WAPAL from PDS5:WAPAL heterodimers
  in vitro. In vivo experiments in Xenopus egg extracts suggest that CDCA5 rearranges
  the topology of cohesin associated proteins so that WAPAL is no longer able to inhibit
  sister chromatid cohesion but remains associated with cohesin (Nishiyama et al.
