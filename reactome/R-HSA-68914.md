stable_id: R-HSA-68914
display_name: DNA polymerase alpha:primase binds at the origin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DNA polymerase alpha:primase is comprised of four subunits, p180, p70, p58,
  and p49. The two primase subunits, p58 and p49, form a tight complex. The p49 subunit
  contains the DNA primase activity and one role of p58 appears to be tethering p49
  to p180, the DNA polymerase catalytic subunit. The fourth subunit, p70, binds p180
  and may tether the DNA polymerase alpha:primase complex to Cdc45.
