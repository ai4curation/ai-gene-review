stable_id: R-HSA-9937535
display_name: TRMT61B methylates adenosine-252 of MT-ND4L mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRMT61B methylates the N1 position in adenosine residues of tRNA (Chujo and
  Suzuki 2012) and mRNA (Li et al. 2017). TRMT61B methylates the adenosine-252 residue
  of the MT-ND4L mRNA. N1-methyladenosine in mitochondrial mRNA appears to cause ribosome
  stalling that results in reduced translation (Li et al. 2017). TRMT61B forms large
  homooligomeric complexes that are presumed to contain homotetramers (Chujo and Suzuki
  2012, also PDB 2B25).
