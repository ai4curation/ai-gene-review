display_name: SLC7A11-mediated exchange of extracellular cysteine and cytosolic glutamate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SLC7A11 as a heterodimer with SLC3A2 in the plasma membrane mediates the
  exchange of glutamate and cystine. Under physiological conditions, cytosolic glutamate
  concentrations are high and cystine concentrations are low, so glutamate is exported
  and cystine imported. SLC7A11 is widely expressed in the body (Bassi et al. 2001;
  Gasol et al. 2004). Note that in Gasol et al., a typographical error has been introduced
  leading to L-cysteine spelling instead of L-cystine.
