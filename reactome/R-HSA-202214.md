display_name: Dephosphorylation of Lck-pY505 by CD45
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TCR stimulation induce the transient dephosphorylation of PAG thereby release
  the Csk from its plasma membrane anchor. The release of Csk from its proximity with
  Lck may serve to facilitate the activation of Lck.Protein tyrosine phosphtase CD45
  (PTPRC) and CD148 (PTPRJ) have dual function in TCR signalling. They act both in
  activation as well as inactivation of Src family kinases (SFKs) which are involved
  in the initiation of TCR signal transduction (Stepanek et al. 2011). The activatory
  role is to dephosphorylate an inhibitory site tyrosine 505 (Y505) at the C-terminal
  end of Lck, which is needed to enable Lck to an open conformation and expose the
  activation loop (A-loop) containing the activating tyrosine 394 (Y394) (Xu et al.
  1993, McNeill et al. 2007, Zikherman et al. 2010, Stepanek et al. 2011, Salmond
  et al. 2009).
