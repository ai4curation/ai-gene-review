stable_id: R-HSA-5696605
display_name: USP12, USP26 deubiquitinate AR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: USP12 (as part of a complex with WDR48 and WDR20) and USP26 can bind the
  androgen receptor and promote its deubiquitination (Faus et al. 2005, Burska et
  al. 2013, Dirac & Bernards 2010). USP26 is specifically expressed in testis tissue
  and is a potential infertility gene (Stouffs et al. 2005).
