display_name: p-Y705-STAT3 dissociates from IL10 dimer:2xp-Y-IL10RA:p-Y-JAK1:2xIL10RB:p-Y-TYK2:p-Y705-STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once phosphorylated, STAT3 dissociates from the receptor, dimerizes with
  other STAT3 molecules, and translocates to the nucleus where it binds with high
  affinity to STAT-binding elements (SBEs) in the promoters of IL-10-inducible genes
  (Donnelly et al. 1999).

## Summary

Once phosphorylated, STAT3 dissociates from the receptor, dimerizes with other STAT3 molecules, and translocates to the nucleus where it binds with high affinity to STAT-binding elements (SBEs) in the promoters of IL-10-inducible genes (Donnelly et al. 1999).
