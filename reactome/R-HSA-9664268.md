display_name: Opsonized leishmania amastigote binds FCGR3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Leishmania amastigotes parasites opsonized by IgG are more susceptible to
  be phagocytosed through FcγRs. Nevertheless, besides the phagocytosis induction,
  the interaction IgG-FcγRs has been implicated in the synthesis induction, of several
  cytokines (Buxbaum 2013; Chu et al. 2010; Thomas and Buxbaum 2008). In particular,
  Buxbaum et al. in 2008 showed that IgGs bound glycoinositol phospholipids (GIPLs)
  of L. Mexicana and that IgG:GIPLs induces the synthesis of IL-10 through FcγRIII.
