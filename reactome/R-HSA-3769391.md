display_name: XPO1 binds the beta-catenin:CBY complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CBY1 contains both NLS and NES sequences and continuously shuttles between
  the cytoplasm and the nucleus.  Treatment of cells with leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor
  of XPO1-mediated nuclear export, results in nuclear accumulation of both CBY1 and
  14-3-3/YWHAZ proteins (Li et al, 2008; Li et al, 2010).  Consistent with this, CBY1
  binds to XPO1 in an NES-dependent manner.   14-3-3/YWHAZ enhances the CBY1-XPO1
  interaction, possibly by inducing a conformational change that exposes the adjacent
  NES sequence.  Binding of 14-3-3/YWHAZ also inhibits the interaction of CBY1 with
  alpha-importin, additionally favouring its cytoplasmic localization.  CBY1 NES mutants
  that are incapable of nuclear export show reduced ability to repress a beta-catenin-dependent
  reporter, and knockdown of endogenous CBY1 causes an accumulation of beta-catenin
  in the nucleus.  These data support a role for CBY1 in the nuclear export of beta-catenin
  (Li et al, 2010). Despite growing evidence for a role for CBY1 in regulating WNT
  signaling, a formal requirement for CBY1 in vivo is still lacking.

## Summary

CBY1 contains both NLS and NES sequences and continuously shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.  Treatment of cells with leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of XPO1-mediated nuclear export, results in nuclear accumulation of both CBY1 and 14-3-3/YWHAZ proteins (Li et al, 2008; Li et al, 2010).  Consistent with this, CBY1 binds to XPO1 in an NES-dependent manner.   14-3-3/YWHAZ enhances the CBY1-XPO1 interaction, possibly by inducing a conformational change that exposes the adjacent NES sequence.  Binding of 14-3-3/YWHAZ also inhibits the interaction of CBY1 with alpha-importin, additionally favouring its cytoplasmic localization.  CBY1 NES mutants that are incapable of nuclear export show reduced ability to repress a beta-catenin-dependent reporter, and knockdown of endogenous CBY1 causes an accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus.  These data support a role for CBY1 in the nuclear export of beta-catenin (Li et al, 2010).
