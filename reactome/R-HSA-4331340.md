display_name: TP53 binds the BBC3 (PUMA) promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'TP53 (p53) binding sites are found in the promoter (Han et al. 2001) and
  intron 1 (Nakano and Vousden 2001) of the BBC3 (PUMA) gene, and are necessary for
  TP53-mediated induction of BBC3 transcription. TP53 family members TP63 (p63) and
  TP73 (p73) can also bind p53 response elements within the BBC3 gene locus (Bergamaschi
  et al. 2004, Patel et al. 2008). Formation of the complex between TP53 family members
  and ASPP proteins PPP1R13B (ASPP1) or TP53BP2 (ASPP2) enhances binding of the p53
  family members to the BBC3 gene locus (Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Patel et al. 2008,
  Wilson et al. 2013). '
