display_name: New CENPA-containing nucleosomes are deposited at the centromere
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A new centromeric nucleosome containing histone H2A, histone H2B, histone
  H4, and CENPA is deposited at the centromere in late telophase/early G1 phase. The
  exact mechanism by which the new CENPA-containing nucleosome is transferred to DNA
  is unknown. HJURP directly binds newly synthesized CENPA before deposition. The
  Mis18 and HJURP complexes are required for deposition of newly synthesized CENPA-containing
  nucleosomes. The exact stoichiometries and interactions of the complexes are unknown.
