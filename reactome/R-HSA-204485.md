species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cyclophilin A (CyPA)1 is an intracellular protein belonging to the immunophilin
  family and is recognized as the major target for the potent immunosuppressive drug
  cyclosporin A. CD147 is the natural cell surface receptor for CyPA. It is demonstrated
  that CD147 is an essential component in the CyPA-initiated signaling cascade that
  culminates in ERK activation.
