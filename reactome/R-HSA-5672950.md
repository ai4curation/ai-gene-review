summary: Activation of RAS downstream of extracellular signals allows RAS:GTP to recruit
  BRAF to the plasma membrane, disrupting the pre-existing inactivating interaction
  between BRAF and the 14-3-3 protein YWHAB (Marais et al, 1997; Yamamori et al, 1995;
  reviewed in Cseh et al, 2014). BRAF, unique of the three mammalian RAF proteins,
  is constitutively phosphorylated on the conserved serine residue (446 in BRAF) in
  the N-terminal acidic motif (NtA). Constitutive negative charge in this region is
  critical for BRAF to function as an activator of other RAF molecules, allowing signal
  amplification (Marais et al, 1997; Mason et al, 1999; Wan et al, 2004; Garnett et
  al, 2005; Hu et al, 2013; reviewed in Cseh et al, 2014). RAS:GTP-bound BRAF heterodimerizes
  with additional RAF monomers, allowing  cis-autophosphorylation in the activation
  loop of the second RAF protein. Once activated by BRAF in this manner, the 'receiver'
  kinase monomer is competent to dimerize with and transactivate other monomers in
  turn (Weber et al, 2001; Garnett et al, 2005; Hu et al, 2013; reviewed in Cseh et
  al, 2014). Intruigingly, the scaffold protein KSR1 is activated by BRAF in a manner
  analogous to other RAF monomers and can similarly act as a RAF activator once it
  is itself activated (Brennan et al, 2011;  Ory et al, 2003; reviewed in Raabe and

## Summary
