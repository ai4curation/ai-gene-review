stable_id: R-HSA-9627078
display_name: XIAP binds CASP9
species: Homo sapiens
summary: X‑linked inhibitor‑of‑apoptosis protein (XIAP) associates with the cleaved
  form of CASP9. It does not influence pro‑caspase‑9 auto‑processing but inhibits
  the activity of processed caspase‑9 and then the activation of effector caspases
  within the apoptosome complex (Srinivasula SM et al. 2001; Bratton SB et al. 2001).
  BIR3 domain of XIAP binds IAP binding motif (IBM) at the amino terminus on the small
  subunit of CASP9, which becomes exposed after proteolytic processing  of procaspase‑9
  at Asp315 (Srinivasula SM et al. 2001). Furthermore, the C‑terminal extremity of
  BIR3 binds the dimer interface of CASP9, interfering with CASP9 dimerization and
  hiding the catalytic residue (Srinivasula SM et al. 2001, Shiozaki EN et al. 2003).
