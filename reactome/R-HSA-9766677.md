stable_id: R-HSA-9766677
display_name: MAP1LC3B binds KEAP1 and SQSTM1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SQSTM1 targets ubiquitinated cargo such as KEAP1 for degradation through
  the selective autophagy pathway. In addition to binding to the KEAP1, SQSTM1 also
  interacts with LC3 proteins that coat the forming autophagosome (Bjorkoy et al,
  2005; Lee et al, 2017; Jain et al, 2010; reviewed in Jiang et al, 2015). Interaction
  between SQSTM1, ubiquitinated KEAP1 and LC3 proteins is enhanced through the binding
  of SESN1 and SESN2 proteins (Bae et al, 2013; Ro et al, 2014).
