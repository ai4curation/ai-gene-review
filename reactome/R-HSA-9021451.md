display_name: NOTCH1,NOTCH3 coactivator complex binds PLXND1 gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PLXND1 gene promoter possesses an RBPJ-binding site which is necessary for
  NOTCH1 and NOTCH3-mediated induction of PLXND1 transcription. It is therefore concluded
  that NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 co-activator complexes directly bind to the PLXND1 gene promoter
  (Rehman et al. 2016).
