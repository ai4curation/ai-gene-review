display_name: D-loop formation mediated by PALB2, BRCA2 and RAD51
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A D-loop structure is formed when complementary duplex DNA (sister chromatid)
  is progressively invaded by the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, with base pairing
  of the invading ssDNA and the complementary sister chromatid DNA strand (Sung et
  al. 2003). PALB2, RAD54, RAD51 paralogs (RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, XRCC3),
  and RAD51AP1 synergistically stimulate RAD51 recombinase activity, thus enhancing
  RAD51-mediated strand exchange and promoting the formation of D-loop structures.
  PALB2 simultaneously interacts with RAD51, BRCA2 and RAD51AP1 (Modesti et al. 2007,
  Wiese et al. 2007, Buisson et al. 2010, Dray et al. 2010). The direct BRCA1 interaction
  with PALB2 helps to fine-tune the localization of BRCA2 and RAD51 at DNA double-strand
  breaks (DSBs) (Zhang et al. 2009, Sy et al. 2009). Phosphorylation of PALB2 by ATR
  on serine residue S59 promotes BRCA1-PALB2 interaction and the localization of PALB2
  to DNA damage sites (Buisson et al. 2017).

## Summary

A D-loop structure is formed when complementary duplex DNA (sister chromatid) is progressively invaded by the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, with base pairing of the invading ssDNA and the complementary sister chromatid DNA strand (Sung et al. 2003). PALB2, RAD54, RAD51 paralogs (RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, XRCC3), and RAD51AP1 synergistically stimulate RAD51 recombinase activity, thus enhancing RAD51-mediated strand exchange and promoting the formation of D-loop structures. PALB2 simultaneously interacts with RAD51, BRCA2 and RAD51AP1 (Modesti et al. 2007, Wiese et al. 2007, Buisson et al. 2010, Dray et al. 2010). The direct BRCA1 interaction with PALB2 helps to fine-tune the localization of BRCA2 and RAD51 at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Zhang et al. 2009, Sy et al. 2009). Phosphorylation of PALB2 by ATR on serine residue S59 promotes BRCA1-PALB2 interaction and the localization of PALB2 to DNA damage sites (Buisson et al. 2017).
