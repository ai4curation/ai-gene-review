display_name: Cohesin binding to decondensed chromatin is facilitated by NIPBL:MAU2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Cohesin, in complex with WAPAL and PDS5 (PDS5A or PDS5B) binds decondensed
  chromatin in telophase (Kueng et al. 2006). This binding is facilitated by the NIPBL:MAU2
  complex, also known as the ''cohesin loading complex''. NIPBL:MAU2 complex is associated
  with chromatin from telophase until prophase (Watrin et al. 2006) but seems to form
  a transient rather than stable complex with cohesin. '

## Summary

Cohesin, in complex with WAPAL and PDS5 (PDS5A or PDS5B) binds decondensed chromatin in telophase (Kueng et al. 2006). This binding is facilitated by the NIPBL:MAU2 complex, also known as the 'cohesin loading complex'. NIPBL:MAU2 complex is associated with chromatin from telophase until prophase (Watrin et al. 2006) but seems to form a transient rather than stable complex with cohesin.
