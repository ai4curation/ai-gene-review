display_name: NOTUM releases Hh-Np:GPC5 from the plasma membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Notum is a secreted protein with phospholipase C activity that has been implicated
  in promoting long range Hh signaling in Drosophila (Ayers et al, 2010; Eugster et
  al, 2007; Takeo et al, 2005; Han et al, 2005; Giraldez et al, 2002).  Notum is thought
  to cleave the GPI-anchor from Dally, a Drosophila glypican, to release Hh-Dally
  complexes from the plasma membrane of the Hh-secreting cell (Ayers et al, 2010;
  Han et al, 2005), although this cleavage has not been directly demonstrated.  In
  cultured mammalian cells, NOTUM has been shown to cleave the GPI anchor of a number
  of glypicans to promote their release from the plasma membrane (Traister et al,
  2008).
