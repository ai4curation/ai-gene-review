stable_id: R-HSA-8984014
display_name: JAK1,JAK2 bound to IL27RA:IL12RB2 receptor phosphorylate STAT1,STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin 35 (IL35) binding activates the IL35 receptor complex and may
  presumably facilitate Tyrosine protein kinase JAK (JAK) phosphorylation. Subsequently,
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta (STAT1) and Signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 alpha/beta (STAT3) may bind to the receptor
  complex and are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Although it is known that
  JAKs are involved in STATs phosphorylation (Stark GR and Darnell JE, 2012), it is
  not clear how other components of the IL35 receptor complex contribute to STAT1/STAT3
  phosphorylation. For this reason, this event is assigned a black box status.
