stable_id: R-HSA-379426
display_name: SLC7A6 (y+LAT2)-mediated exchange of extracellular leucine for cytosolic
  arginine
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SLC7A6 as a heterodimer with SLC3A2 in the plasma membrane mediates the exchange
  of arginine for leucine and a sodium ion. The physiological concentrations of arginine
  and leucine are expected to favor arginine export. By the criterion of Northern
  blotting, SLC7A6 is expressed in a variety of tissues (Broer et al. 2000).
