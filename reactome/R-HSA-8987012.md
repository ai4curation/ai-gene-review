species: Homo sapiens
summary: Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) is phosphorylated after Interleukin-24
  (IL24) ligand interaction with its receptor. There are two IL24 receptors. One consists
  of Interleukin-20 receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA), Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1
  (JAK1) and Interleukin-20 receptor subunit beta (IL20RB), the other, represented
  in this event, uses interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL22RA1) instead of
  IL20RA (Dumoutier et al. 2001, Wang et al. 2002). IL22RA1 can bind JAK1 (Ferrao
  et al. 2016). IL24 can stimulate JAK1 phosphorylation in human colonic subepithelial
  myofibroblasts, where the components of both forms of the IL24 receptor are expressed
  (Andoh et al. 2009). It has been demonstrated that both forms of the IL24 receptor
  can activate STAT3 (Dumoutier et al. 2001, Wang et al. 2002). Based on the consensus
  understanding of JAK/STAT signaling, STAT3 activation is very likely to be preceded
  by JAK1 phosphorylation and it is therefore likely that JAK1 is phosphorylated in
  both forms of the IL24 receptor.   This is a black box event because it has not
  been established that both forms of the IL24 receptor are involved in JAK1 phosphorylation.
