display_name: Repair DNA synthesis of ~27-30 bases long patch by POLD, POLE or POLK
  in TC-NER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), as well as
  in global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), the DNA synthesis complex
  (NER post-incision complex) consisting of PCNA, RPA, RFC and polymerase delta (POLD)
  or epsilon (POLE) complexes performs DNA repair synthesis after the damaged DNA
  strand is incised 5' to the lesion by the endonuclease complex ERCC1:ERCC4 (ERCC1:XPF)
  and 3' to the lesion by the endonuclease XPG (ERCC5). Depending on damage-induced
  PCNA monoubiquitination, DNA polymerase kappa (POLK) may also be involved in gap-filling
  DNA synthesis during nucleotide excision repair (NER) (Balajee et al. 1998, Staresincic
  et al. 2009, Ogi et al. 2010, Overmeer et al. 2011).
