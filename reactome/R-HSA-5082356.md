## Summary

Combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) microarray analysis and time course gene expression microarray analysis with and without siRNA-mediated inhibition of HSF1 showed that human HSF1 can induce the expression of different sets of target genes to maintain a wide range of biological processes (e.g., anti-apoptosis, RNA splicing, ubiquitination)(Page TG et al. 2006; Vihervaara A. et al. 2013). However, HSF1 is best known for rapid stress-induced upregulation of certain genes related to protein folding, such as HSPA1A/HSP70, HSPC/HSP90, HSPB1/HSP27, and DNAJB1/HSP40 (Mosser DD et al. 1988; Trinklein ND et al. 2004a,b; Page TG et al. 2006; Vihervaara A. et al. 2013).<p>In the nucleus acetylation of Histone H3 is linked to the function of the Elongator complex in transcription (Kim JH et al. 2002).
