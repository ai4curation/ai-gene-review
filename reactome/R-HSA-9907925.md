display_name: Formation of the inner ring of the 20S immunoproteasome core particle
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the immunoproteasomes, the 20S core particle (20S iCP) inner ring subunits
  with proteolytic activity, PSMB6 (beta-1), PSMB7 (beta-2), and PSMB5 (beta-5), are
  substituted with PSMB9 (beta-1i), PSMB10 (beta-2i), and PSMB8 (beta-5i), respectively
  (Bai et al. 2014). The order of incorporation of beta subunits in immunoproteasomes
  likely differs from the order of incorporation in the canonical 20S CPs (Bai et
  al. 2014). The immunoproteasome generates substrate cleavage patterns that enhance
  loading of peptides onto the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC I) for
  immune presentation to killer T cells (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013).
