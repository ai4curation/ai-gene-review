stable_id: R-HSA-9018573
display_name: NOTCH3 binds activated EGFR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The intracellular domain of NOTCH3 (NICD3) co-immunoprecipitates with ligand
  activated, autophosphorylated EGFR. Binding of NOTCH3 to EGFR is inhibited by erlotinib
  treatment, which prevents EGFR activation (Arasada et al. 2014).
