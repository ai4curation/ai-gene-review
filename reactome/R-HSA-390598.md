stable_id: R-HSA-390598
display_name: Myosin Binds ATP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A molecule of ATP binds to the large cleft on the side of the myosin head
  farthest from the actin filament and immediately causes a slight change in the conformation
  of the domains that make up the actin-binding site. This reduces the affinity of
  the myosin head for actin and allows it to move along the filament.

## Summary

A molecule of ATP binds to the large cleft on the side of the myosin head farthest from the actin filament and immediately causes a slight change in the conformation of the domains that make up the actin-binding site. This reduces the affinity of the myosin head for actin and allows it to move along the filament.
