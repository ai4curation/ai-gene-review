stable_id: R-HSA-917987
display_name: TFRC dimer binds 2xholoTF
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) molecules can be found on the outside of any
  cell. Transferrin (TF), loaded with iron (holoTF), transports two ferric iron ions
  through the blood and two holoTFs bind to a TFRC dimer, which mediates cellular
  uptake of holoTF in a non-iron dependent manner (West et al. 2001).

## Summary

Transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) molecules can be found on the outside of any cell. Transferrin (TF), loaded with iron (holoTF), transports two ferric iron ions through the blood and two holoTFs bind to a TFRC dimer, which mediates cellular uptake of holoTF in a non-iron dependent manner (West et al. 2001).
