display_name: Release of p-PLCG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated PLC-gamma1 disassociates from LAT. Membrane binding is crucial
  for PLC-gamma 1 activity. The PH-domain of PLC-gamma 1 binds to phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate [PdtIns(3,4,5)P3], and is targeted to the membrane (Todderud
  et al. 1990, Wang & Wang. 2003, Kim et al. 2000). Activated PLCG1 then hydrolyses
  PIP2 to Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and DAG
