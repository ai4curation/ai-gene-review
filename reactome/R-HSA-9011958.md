stable_id: R-HSA-9011958
display_name: miR-26A and B bind to the 3'UTR of the GREB1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Translation of GREB1 mRNA is negatively regulated by mIR-26A and B, which
  bind directly to the 3'UTR. mIR-26A and B are both downregulated in the presence
  of estrogen in a manner that depends on estrogen-stimulated MYC gene expression.
  Of the nine identified estrogen-responsive, mIR-26 regulated genes, GREB1, CHD1
  and KPNA2 are the only three that contribute to the proliferative response to estrogen
  (Tan et al, 2014).
