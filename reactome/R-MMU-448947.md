display_name: Interaction of Bnip-2 with Cdc42
species: Mus musculus
summary: 'Bnip-2 interacts with Cdc42 through its Bnip-2 and Cdc42GAP homology (BCH)
  domain and thus it acts as a linkage between the CDO receptor and the Cdc42 activity.
  Formation of a CDO-Bnip-2-Cdc42 complex stimulates Cdc42 activation which in turn
  promotes p38 alpha/beta activity and cell differentiation. '
