display_name: TNFAIP8 proteins transfer PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4,5)P3 from cytosolic vesicles
  to plasma membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8 family are all thought
  to be related to carcinogenesis (Lou & Liu 2011). TNFAIP8 and TNFAIP8L1 (aka TIPE1)
  may play roles in oncogenesis and TNFAIP8L2 (aka TIPE2) is an essential negative
  regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity and may play an important role in
  the development of inflammatory diseases. TNFAIP8L3 (aka TIPE3) is an important
  regulator of tumorigenesis through its activation of phospholipid signaling (Fayngerts
  et al. 2014). TNFAIP8 proteins are cytosolic proteins that contain a large hydrophobic
  cavity that is occupied by a phospholipid-like molecule. Although TNFAIP8 proteins
  can transport many phospholipids, they are thought to preferentially transport phosphoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PI(4,5)P2) and  phosphoinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) from cytoplasmic
  vesicle membranes to the plasma membrane (Moniz & Vanhaesebroeck 2014, Cui et al.
  2015). TNFAIP8L3 is highly expressed in most human carcinoma cell lines and more
  than half of human cancers have aberrantly upregulated phosphoinositide signals.
  How phospholipid signals are controlled during tumorigenesis is not fully understood
  (Fayngerts et al. 2014).
