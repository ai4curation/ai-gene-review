display_name: YWHAB dimer dissociates from KSR1:MARK3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Dephosphorylation of KSR1 S406 by PP2A promotes the dissociation of 14-3-3
  from this site, exposing both the CR1 region that is required for membrane localization
  of KSR1 and the MAPK-binding FxFP motif (Ory et al, 2003; Muller et al, 2001; reviewed
  in Raabe and Raap, 2003).

## Summary

Dephosphorylation of KSR1 S406 by PP2A promotes the dissociation of 14-3-3 from this site, exposing both the CR1 region that is required for membrane localization of KSR1 and the MAPK-binding FxFP motif (Ory et al, 2003; Muller et al, 2001; reviewed in Raabe and Raap, 2003).
