display_name: Activated FGFR4:p-FRS binds GRB2:SOS1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Tyrosine phosphorylated FRS2 recruits GRB2:SOS1 complex by means of the SH3
  domain of GRB2, leading to RAS-MAP kinase activation.  The FRS2:GRB2-mediated pathway
  plays a minor role in the activation of RAS-MAP kinase pathway compared to that
  mediated by FRS2:PPTN11.
