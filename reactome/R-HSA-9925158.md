stable_id: R-HSA-9925158
display_name: CD274 mRNA binds miR-152 RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA-152 (miR-152) is a critical regulator of innate immune response.
  Being a member of miR142/152 family, it is known to play a role in regulating NK
  cells mediated cytosis and dendritic cells mediated antigen presentation (Liu et
  al., 2016). miR-152 also regulates CD274 (PD-L1) expression in normal immune cells
  and studied extensively in cancers. miR-152 binds directly to B7-H1 3′-UTR region
  and inhibit B7-H1 expression in AGS and SGC-7901 cells (Wang et al., 2017, Xie et
  al., 2017)
