display_name: Mutant RAS:p-RAF complexes bind MAP2Ks and MAPKs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAF dimerization and phosphorylation downstream of oncogenic RAS and RAF
  mutations is associated with increased MAP2K and MAPK phosphorylation (Wan et al,
  2004; Garnett et al, 2005; reviewed in Holderfield et al, 2014). Although the interactions
  between oncogenic RAS or RAFs and downstream effectors hasn't been studied in detail,
  these disease pathways are presumed to recruit MAP2Ks and MAPKs in a scaffold-dependent
  manner similar to WT (reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011).
