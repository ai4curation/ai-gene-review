display_name: CFTR transits to the plasma membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated
  chloride ion channel that undergoes multiple folding processes and post-translational
  modifications during its biosynthesis.  60-80% of CFTR protein encoded by the wild-type
  (WT) gene is successfully modified and transits the secretory system to the plasma
  membrane.  The remaining misfolded protein is targeted for degradation by the ER,
  lysosomes or autophagy (reviewed in Pranke and Sermet-Gaudelus, 2014)
