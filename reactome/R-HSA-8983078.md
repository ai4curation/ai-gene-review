stable_id: R-HSA-8983078
display_name: p-STAT3 dissociates from TSLP:IL7R:CRLF2:p-STAT3 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Inferred from mouse:<br>Signal transducer and activator of transcription
  5A, 5B (STAT5A and STAT5B) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) are phosphorylated upon addition of human Thymic stromal lymphopoietin
  (TSLP) when both Cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) and Interleukin-7 Receptor
  (IL7R) are present (Reche et al. 2001). Subsequently the phosphorylated STATs dissociate.
  <br>This is black box event since as not been demonstrated experimentally.
