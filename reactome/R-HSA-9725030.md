## Summary

NPM-ALK-mediated activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway leads to phosphorylation and activation of MAPK1 (ERK2) (Illert et al, 2012). Nuclear MAPK1 phosphorylates ZC3HC1 at a number of serine residues, with residues 354 and 359 playing an initiating role in subsequent phosphorylations (Illert et al, 2012; Gegenbacher et al, 2019).  Phosphorylation of serine residues within ZC3HC1 inactivates the SCF complex, allowing CCNB1 to accumulate and drive entry into mitosis (Ouyang et al, 2003; Basserman et al, 2005; Illert et al, 2012; Gegenbacher et al, 2019). 
NPM-ALK may also phosphorylate tyrosine residues in ZC3HC1, but the significance of these phosphorylations is not completely elucidated (Ouyang et a, 2003).
