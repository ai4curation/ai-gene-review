display_name: Liganded G12/13-activating GPCRs bind inactive heterotrimeric G-protein
  G12/13
species: Homo sapiens
summary: About 25 receptors are reported to couple to the G12/13 G protein subtype
  (Riobo & Manning, 2005).Direct assay methods have not identified a receptor that
  only couples with G12. At least one receptor (5-HT4) only couples with G13, but
  most other receptors are reported to couple with both G12 and G13.
