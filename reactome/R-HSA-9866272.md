display_name: 2Fe-2S is inserted in UQCRFS1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Frataxin (FXN) subunit of the 2Fe-2S transfer complex catalyzes the insertion
  of one 2Fe-2S cluster in the Complex III subunit UQCRFS1 (Rieske protein) as part
  of a UQCRFS1:LYRM7 complex. The process requires the presence of the co-chaperone
  complex HSPA9:HSCB (Maio et al., 2017; Fernandez-Vizarra & Zeviani, 2018).
