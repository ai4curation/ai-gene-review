stable_id: R-HSA-379865
display_name: proline + tRNA(Pro) + ATP => Pro-tRNA(Pro) + AMP + pyrophosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Multifunctional EPRS (cytosolic glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase) catalyzes
  the reaction of proline, tRNA(Pro), and ATP to form Pro-tRNA(Pro), AMP, and pyrophosphate.
  The same enzyme also catalyzes the charging of tRNA(Glu) with glutamate. The enzyme
  is found in the cell as a component of the mutienzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
  complex (Kaiser et al. 1994).
