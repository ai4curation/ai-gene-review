display_name: Cargo Recognition And Sorting
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Initiation/Cargo Recognition is mediated by ESCRT-0, a heterodimer consisting
  of Vps27 and Hse1. ESCRT-0 binds Phosphatidyl inositol 3- phosphate (PI3P) on endosomes
  via a FVYE domain and ubiquitinated cargo via two UIM domains.
