stable_id: R-HSA-9656781
display_name: Deltarasin binds PDE6D
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Deltarasin is a small molecule inhibitor of PDE6D that binds in the farnesyl-binding
  pocket of the enzyme and prevents interaction with KRAS4B and other farnesylated
  proteins (Zimmerman et al, 2013). PDE6D inhibition results in RAS protein mislocalization
  and reduces cellular proliferation and increase cell death in KRAS-dependent pancreatic
  cell lines (Zimmerman et al, 2013; reviewed in Shimansu et al, 2017). Other farnesyl-pocket
  binding small molecule inhibitors are also under development (Papke et al, 2016).
