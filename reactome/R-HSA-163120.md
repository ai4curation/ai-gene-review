display_name: Disassociation of Telomerase RNP and the Chromosome End
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In vitro, telomerase can disassociate from the primer following addition
  of each nucleotide or during the translocation step. The regulation of telomerase
  disassociation from the telomere in vivo is not well-characterized (de Lange 2002,
  Zhu et al. 2003, Ye et al. 2004, Smorgozewska and de Lange 2004, Tomita 2018). One
  factor that may be involved is a helicase termed hPIF1, which can unanneal the telomerase
  RNA/telomeric DNA hybrid (Boule et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2006). PIF1 can directly
  interact with telomerase (Mateyak and Zakian 2006) and it acts to inhibit telomerase
  activity and telomere lengthening (Zhang et al. 2006, Paeschke et al. 2013).<br>In
  addition to regulation of telomere lengthening, PIF1 is also involved in resolution
  of G-quadruplex (G4) structures in single-stranded nucleic acid intermediates that
  form during DNA replication and gene expression (Sanders 2010, Paeschke et al. 2013).
