display_name: Binding of TFIIE to the growing preinitiation complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Factor TFIIE enters the preinitiation complex after TFIIF recruits RNA Polymerase
  II.  TFIIE is composed of two subunits of 56 kDA and 34 kDa.  TFIIE facilitates
  the recruitment of factor TFIIH to the preinitiation complex, and it also stimulates
  the phosphorylation of the RNA Polymerase II CTD by TFIIH.
