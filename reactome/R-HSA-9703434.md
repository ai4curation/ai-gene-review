display_name: FLT3 fusions recruit PIK3CA through PIK3R1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The 110 kDa catalytic subunit of PI3K is likely recruited to FLT3 fusions
  through interaction with the p85 regulatory subunit, as is the case for the wild-type
  receptor. GAB2-mediated conformational changes in the p85 regulatory subunit stimulate
  interaction with p110, and promote PI3K/AKT signaling downstream of activated FLT3
  (Zhang et al, 1999; Zhang et al, 2000; Vu et al, 2007; Masson et al, 2009; Grand
  et al, 2007; Troadec et al, 2017; Chonabayashi et al, 2013; reviewed in Kazi and

GAB2-mediated conformational changes in the p85 regulatory subunit stimulate interaction with p110, and promote PI3K/AKT signaling downstream of activated FLT3 (Zhang et al, 1999; Zhang et al, 2000; Vu et al, 2007; Masson et al, 2009; Grand et al, 2007; Troadec et al, 2017; Chonabayashi et al, 2013; reviewed in Kazi and Ronnstrand, 2019).
