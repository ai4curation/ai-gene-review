display_name: sCD163 binds MYH9 in T-cells
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The soluble form of CD163 (sCD163) has been suggested to inhibit activated
  T-lymphocyte proliferation (P Högger & Sorg 2001) by potentially binding to a non-muscle
  myosin heavy chain type a (MYH9) (Timmermann et al. 2004, Hou et al. 2019).
