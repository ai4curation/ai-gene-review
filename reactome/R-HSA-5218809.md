stable_id: R-HSA-5218809
display_name: PTK2 and SRC-1 phosphorylate PXN on Y31 and Y118
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon stimulation FAK1 (also known as PTK2), in association with Src family
  kinases (SFKs) phosphorylates paxillin (PXN) at two main sites- tyrosine 31 and
  tyrosine 118. These phosphorylated sites provides the functional SH2-binding sites
  for members of the Crk family of SH2-SH3 adaptor proteins (Bellis et al. 1995, Shaller
  & Schaefer 2001).
