display_name: Recruitment of Brca1 to Unsynapsed Regions
species: Mus musculus
summary: Unsynapsed regions of chromosomes are silenced during pachytene by a process
  called Meiotic Silencing of Unsynapsed Chromatin (MSUC) and, in the case of the
  X and Y chromosomes, Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation (MSCI). Unsynapsed meiotic
  chromatin recruits Brca11 (Turner et al. 2004, Turner et al. 2005, Mahadevaiah et
  al. 2008, Kouznetsova et al. 2009). The recruitment requires Sycp3 of axial elements
  of the synaptonemal complex, which may remain exposed in unsynapsed regions (Kouznetsova
  et al. 2009).
