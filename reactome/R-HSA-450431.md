stable_id: R-HSA-450431
display_name: ZFP36 (TTP) recruits RNA degradation activities
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TTP interacts directly with exonucleases (XRN1 and the exosome) and decapping
  enzymes (DCP1a and DCP2) which hydrolyze the mRNA bound by TTP. TTP also recruits
  PARN deadenylase, however a direct interaction between TTP and PARN has not been
  demonstrated.
