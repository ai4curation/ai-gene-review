stable_id: R-HSA-444879
display_name: Relaxin receptor 2 binds relaxin 2 and INSL3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Relaxin receptor 2 (RXFP2 or LGR8) is activated by porcine relaxin, human
  relaxin-2  and insulin-like peptide-3 (INSL3). Relaxin affinity is lower than for
  Relaxin receptor 1, suggesting that this receptor functions as an INSL3 receptor.
