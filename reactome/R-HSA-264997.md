display_name: P4HB mediates disulfide bond formation in Proinsulin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In vitro, P4HB (PDIA1) in its oxidized form (HC53,56-P4HB) mediates the correct
  folding of proinsulin with disulfide bond formation and is itself reduced to P4HB
  (Hudson et al. 2015; Winter et al. 2011). Studies of insulin processing in knockout
  mutant mice are consistent with this role for P4HB, while also suggesting that other
  disulfide isomerases, not annotated here, could play a role in this process in vivo
  (Jang et al. 2019).
