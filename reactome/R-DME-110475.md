display_name: DAkt1-mediated phosphorylation inactivates DFOXO
species: Drosophila melanogaster
summary: DFOXO belongs to the FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors. The
  FOXO factors regulate genes involved in cell cycle control, cell death and stress
  responses. Phosphorylation of DFOXO by DAkt1 on three residues (Thr44, Ser190 and
  Ser259) leads to its cytoplasmic retention and inactivation, inhibiting expression
  of DFOXO-regulated genes. These include D4EBP, DInR and Chico.
