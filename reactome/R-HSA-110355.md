summary: 'APEX1 (APE1, HAP1), a DNA apurinic/apyrimidinic site lyase, displaces MUTYH
  (MYH) from the AP site generated by the MUTYH DNA glycosylase activity, thus increasing

## Summary

APEX1 (APE1, HAP1), a DNA apurinic/apyrimidinic site lyase, displaces MUTYH (MYH) from the AP site generated by the MUTYH DNA glycosylase activity, thus increasing MUTYH turnover and overall glycosylase efficiency, and allowing for the base excision repair to proceed (Yang et al. 2001).
