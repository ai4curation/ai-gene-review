stable_id: R-HSA-5252072
display_name: AZGP1 binds PIP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (AZGP1) (Sanchez et al. 1997), a 41 kDa protein
  secreted in many bodily fluids, is thought to stimulate lipolysis and be the cause
  of the excessive fat loss seen in cancer cachexia (Russell et al. 2004). AZGP1 is
  able to bind prolactin-inducible protein (PIP) (Myal et al. 1991), another secreted
  protein overexpressed in certain breast cancers (Hassan et al. 2008, Debily et al.
  2009).
