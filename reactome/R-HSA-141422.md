stable_id: R-HSA-141422
display_name: MAD2 converted  to an inhibitory state via interaction with Mad1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In vitro structural studies have shown that Mad2 undergoes a major conformational
  change upon binding to Mad1. This conformational change is postulated to activate
  Mad2 into a high affinity state which can bind and sequester Cdc20 from the APC.
