  Gab2
species: Mus musculus
summary: Grb2 associated binding protein 2 (Gab2) is believed to bind and be phosphorylated
  in response to Interleukin-2 (Il2) and Interleukin-15 (Il15) stimulation. Its phosphorylation
  is greatly diminished by mutation of the site in the Interleukin-2 Receptor beta
  chain (Y338F) (Il2rb) that recruits SHC transforming protein 1 (Shc1) (Gadina et
  al.2000, Wöhrle et al.2009, Gesbert et al. 1998, Brockdorff et al. 2001).<br>Gab2
  is a phosphoprotein that is suggested to associates with PI3kinase, Growth factor
  receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and Tyrosine protein phosphatase non-receptor type
  11 (Ptpn11 or Shp2) in T and Natural Killer (NK) cells (Gu et al. 2000).<br>This
  is a black box event because Gab2 binding is inferred from Il15 stimulation of Gab2
  phosphorylation (Brockdorff et al. 2001).
