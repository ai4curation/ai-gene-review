display_name: LINC01139 promotes phosphorylation of HIF1A by LRRK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: LRRK2 serine/threonine kinase, activated via long non-coding RNA LINC01139
  (LINK-A) mediated recruitment to phosphorylated GPNMB (bound to HBEGF-activated
  EGFR), phosphorylates hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A) at serine residue
  S797. LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of HIF1A at S797 promotes association of HIF1A
  with EP300 (p300) transcriptional co-activator and inhibits association of HIF1A
  with a transactivation inhibitor HIF1AN (FIH) (Lin et al. 2016).
