  that only low levels or transient recruitment are required. Kim & Baumann demonstrated
  that IL6 induced ERK activation was not inhibited in cells transfected with a phosphatase
  inactive mutant of  PTPN11, whereas a PTPN11 mutant missing the GRB2 interaction
  region significantly suppressed ERK activation. This suggests that phosphatase activity
  is not required for ERK activation while PTPN11 interaction with GRB2 is important.
  However, overexpression studies can generate artefactual interactions and this interpretation

  In this proposal phosphorylated PTPN11 dissociates from IL6ST and becomes associated
  with membrane associated GAB1 in a complex with PI3-kinases (Takahashi-Tezuka et
  al. 1998, Eulenfeld & Schaper 2009). PTPN11 interaction is suggested to induce a
  conformational change in GAB1 that permits GAB1-PI3-kinase activation and enhancement
  of IL6-induced ERK pathway activation. However this is speculative, the role of
  PTPN11 phosphatase function is unclear. Other possible mechanisms are outlined by
  Dance et al. (2008), extrapolated from growth factor receptor mechanisms but with
  unknown relevance to IL6 and its interaction with IL6ST.
