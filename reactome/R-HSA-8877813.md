display_name: DENND5A,B exchange GTP for GDP on RAB39
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAB39 proteins are involved in endolysosomal trafficking and are localized
  to the Golgi membrane where they interact with the multisubunit tethering complex
  COG (Chen et al, 2003; Giannandrea et al, 2010; Miller et al, 2013; reviewed in
  Willet et al, 2013). Although RAB proteins are known to play key roles in trafficking
  and Golgi structure and function, the significance of some of these interactions
  is not yet clear (reviewed in Liu and Storrie, 2015). Loss-of-function mutations
  of RAB39B cause X-linked metal retardation, likely as a result of altered trafficking
  during growth cone and synapse formation (Giannandrea et al, 2010). Activation of
  RAB39 at the Golgi is dependent on the GEF activity of DENND5A and DENND5B (Yoshimura
  et al, 2010). Interaction of RAB39:GDP with its GEFs promotes release of GDP, allowing
  GTP to bind, and precludes the interaction of RAB39 with GDI and CHM proteins.
