display_name: Export of Spliced Viral mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the cases of spliced, polyadenylated mRNA transcribed from M (segment
  7) and NS (segment 8) vRNA templates (producing the spliced mRNA for M2 and NS2/NEP,
  respectively), export may be coupled to aspects of the cellular splicing and export
  mechanisms (Chen, 2000;  Alonso-Caplan et al, 1992; Amorim, 2006).  Simultaneously,
  the export of cellular mRNA appear to be inhibited by the viral NS1 protein, which
  binds to the cellular cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), preventing
  polyadenylation and completion of pre-mRNA processing (Nemerof et al., 1998; Fortes,
  1994; Lu, 1994; Li, 2001).
