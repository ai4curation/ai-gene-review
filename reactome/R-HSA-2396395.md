display_name: HSPG2 (perlecan) binds alpha-dystroglycan
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HSPG2 (perlecan) is a modular proteoglycan primarily located in the basement
  membranes of vascularized tissues. It is involved in several developmental processes,
  both during embryogenesis and in human disease such as cancer and diabetes (Iozzo
  et al. 1994). Domain V of the core protein binds alpha-dystroglycan (Talts et al.
  1999), which in vivo forms a membrane-associated heterodimer with beta-dystroglycan
  (Peng et al. 1998).
