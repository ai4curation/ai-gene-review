species: Homo sapiens
summary: The classical model of JAK-STAT signaling suggests that phosphorylated Signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) translocates to the nucleus (Akira
  et al. 1994) where it binds DNA to mediate the effects of Interleukin-13 (IL13)
  on expression of cytokines, soluble mediators and cell surface molecules by cells
  of myeloid origin, with important consequences for their ability to activate and
  sustain immune and inflammatory responses. <br><br>Recently, STATs have been shown
  to shuttle freely between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, independent of tyrosine
  phosphorylation (Liu et al. 2005, Li 2008, Reich 2013). Binding of unphosphorylated
  STAT3 to DNA has been reported (Nkansah et al. 2013). As it is not clear what triggers
  nuclear accumulation of STATs in response to IL13, this event is shown as an uncertain
  process.
