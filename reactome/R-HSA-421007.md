species: Homo sapiens
summary: GluR2 containing AMPA receptors are constitutively recycled between the endosome
  membrane and the plasma membrane. GRIP and PICK compete for the binding to the C
  tail of GluR2. Once the GluR2 containing AMPA receptors are in the plasmamembrane,
  phosphorylation of GluR2 at S880 by PKC causes disruption of GRIP interaction, but
  not PICK interaction  which facilitates internalization of GluR2 containing AMPA
  receptors into endosomes.
