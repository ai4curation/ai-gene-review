stable_id: R-HSA-139952
display_name: Caspase-8 processing in the DISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Caspase-8 zymogens are present in the cells as inactive monomers, containing
  a large N-terminal prodomain with two death effector domains (DED), and a C-terminal
  catalytic subunit composed of small and a large domains separated by a smaller linker
  region [Donepudi M et al 2003; Keller N et al 2009]. Dimerization is required for
  the caspase-8 activation [Donepudi M et al 2003]. Once dimerized, caspase-8 zymogen
  undergoes a series of autoproteolytic cleavage events at aspartic acid residues
  in their interdomain linker regions. A second cleavage event between the the N-terminal
  prodomain and the catalytic domain releases the active caspase from the activation
  complex into the cytosol. The resulting fully active enzyme is a homodimer of catalytic
  domains, where each domain is composed of a large p18 and a small p10 subunit [Keller
  N et al 2009; Oberst A et al 2010].
