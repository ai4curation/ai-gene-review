species: Homo sapiens
summary: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 1 (SARS‑CoV‑1) M protein
  is a glycosylated structural protein with three transmembrane (TM) domains. M protein
  predominantly localizes to the Golgi complex and is essential for the assembly of
  viral particles. SARS‑CoV‑1 M protein suppresses the production of type I IFNs in
  human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293 cells) expressing RIG‑I (DDX58), MDA5 (IFIH1),
  TRAF3, TBK1 and IKKε (IKBKE) proteins (Siu KL et al. 2009; 2014). IFN antagonism
  was mediated by the N‑terminal TM1 domain of M protein (amino acids 1–38), which
  targets M protein to the Golgi complex (Siu KL et al. 2014). Co‑immunoprecipitation
  analysis revealed that TM1 of M protein interacted with TRAF3, RIG‑I (DDX58), TBK1
  and IKKε (IKBKE) (Siu KL et al. 2014) in HEK293 expressing tagged proteins (Siu
  KL et al. 2014). SARS‑CoV‑1 M protein is thought to prevent the formation of the
  TRAF3:TANK:TBK1/IKBKE complex and thereby inhibit TBK1/IKBKE‑dependent activation
  of IRF3/IRF7 transcription factors downstream of MAVS (Siu KL et al. 2009; 2014).
  The Reactome event shows binding of SARS‑CoV‑1 M protein to TBK1/IKBKE.
