stable_id: R-HSA-382556
display_name: ABC-family proteins mediated transport
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of active transporters involves
  a large number of functionally diverse transmembrane proteins. They transport  a
  variety of compounds through membranes against steep concentration gradients at
  the cost of ATP hydrolysis.  These substrates include amino acids, lipids, inorganic
  ions, peptides, saccharides, peptides for antigen presentation, metals, drugs, and
  proteins. The ABC transporters not only move a variety of substrates into and out
  of the cell, but are also involved in intracellular compartmental transport. Energy
  derived from the hydrolysis of ATP is used to transport the substrate across the
  membrane against a concentration gradient. Human genome contains 48 ABC genes; 16
  of these have a known function and 14 are associated with a defined human disease
  (Dean et al. 2001, Borst and Elferink 2002, Rees et al. 2009).
