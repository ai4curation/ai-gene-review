summary: After biosynthesis on the Golgi membrane, gangliosides localize to other
  membranes via vesicle transport, endocytosis, and exocytosis. To decouple transport
  from vesicular transport of proteins, gangliosides are additionally transported

## Summary

After biosynthesis on the Golgi membrane, gangliosides localize to other membranes via vesicle transport, endocytosis, and exocytosis. To decouple transport from vesicular transport of proteins, gangliosides are additionally transported via non-vesicular processes (reviewed by Perry & Ridgway, 2005; Funato et al., 2020).
