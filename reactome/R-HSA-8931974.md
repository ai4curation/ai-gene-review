stable_id: R-HSA-8931974
display_name: N6AMT2 transfers 3xCH3 from 3xAdoMet to EEF1A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (EEF1A) is an essential, highly methylated
  protein that facilitates translational elongation by delivering aminoacyl-tRNAs
  to ribosomes. EEF1AKMT1 (N6AMT2) trimethylates EEF1A at Lys-79, a high-stoichiometry
  N-terminal site that is conserved from yeast to humans (Hamey et al. 2016).
