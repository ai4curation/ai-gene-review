stable_id: R-HSA-9855252
display_name: SDHA:SDHB binds to SDHC:SDHD
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After translation in cytosol and translocation to the mitochondrial inner
  membrane SDH subunits C and D (SDHC, SDHD), together with the heme b cofactor, bind
  to the assembled cytosolic SDHA:SDHB construct to form the fully functional SDH
  complex. Although a full structure of the porcine complex exists (PDB 1ZOY) no details
  are known about the last steps of the assembly. However, successful assembly depends
  on the presence of both the SDHC heme b cofactor and the C-terminal tail of the
  SDHA subunit. (Lemarie & Grimm, 2009; Kim et al., 2012; reviewed in Van Vranken
  et al., 2014; Signes & Fernandez-Vizarra, 2018).

Although a full structure of the porcine complex exists (PDB 1ZOY) no details are known about the last steps of the assembly.
