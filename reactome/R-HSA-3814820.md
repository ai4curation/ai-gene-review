## Summary

Endorepellin is the 85-kDa C-terminal domain V of HSPG2 (perlecan). It consists of a series of laminin-like globular (LG) domains interconnected by short epidermal growth factor-like repeats (Hohenester & Engel 2002). Endorepellin has angiostatic activity (Mongiat et al. 2003) which is primarily localised in the LG3 domain (Bix et al. 2004). 

Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1), its isoform mammalian Tolloid (mTLD), mammalian Tolloid-like-1 and -2 (TLL1, TLL2)  (Gonzalez et al. 2005) and cathepsin-L1 (Cailhier et al. 2008) can liberate LG3 by cleaving endorepellin between Asn4196 and Asp4197.
