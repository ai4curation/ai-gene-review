summary: WASP interacting proteins (WIP) family includes WIPF1 (WIP), WIPF2 (WIRE,WICH)
  and WIPF3 (CR16, corticosteroids and regional expression-16). WIPs share a specific
  proline rich sequence that interacts with the WH1 domain of WASP and N-WASP (WASL).
  WIPs form heterocomplexes with WASPs and may contribute to the WASP protein stability
  (Aspenstrom 2002, Kato et al. 2002, Ho et al. 2001, Moreau et al. 2000).<br>SH3
  domain containing adaptor proteins like GRB2 (Carlier et al. 2000), NCK (Rohatgi
  et al. 2001) and WISH (DIP/SPIN90) (Fukuoka et al. 2001) bind to the proline rich
  domain in WASPs and activate the ARP2/3 complex. By binding simultaneously to N-WASP
  and the ARP2/3 complex, GRB2 works synergistically with CDC42 in the activation
  of ARP2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly (Carlier et al. 2000).
