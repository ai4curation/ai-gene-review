display_name: Dynamin-mediated GTP hydrolysis promotes vesicle scission
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Self-assembly of dynamin around the neck of the emerging clathrin-coated
  vesicle stimulates its GTPase activity. This in turn promotes a conformational change
  in dynamin organization that is required for membrane fission (Hinshaw and Schmid,
  1995; Sweitzer and Hinshaw, 1998; Takei et al, 1999; Yoshida et al, 2004; Chappie
  et al, 2010;  Chappie et al, 2011; Ford et al, 2011; Faelber et al, 2011; reviewed

## Summary

Self-assembly of dynamin around the neck of the emerging clathrin-coated vesicle stimulates its GTPase activity. This in turn promotes a conformational change in dynamin organization that is required for membrane fission (Hinshaw and Schmid, 1995; Sweitzer and Hinshaw, 1998; Takei et al, 1999; Yoshida et al, 2004; Chappie et al, 2010;  Chappie et al, 2011; Ford et al, 2011; Faelber et al, 2011; reviewed in Daumke et al, 2014).
