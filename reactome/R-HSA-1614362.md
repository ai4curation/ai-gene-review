display_name: SUMF1 mediates the oxidation of cysteine to formylglycine, producing
  active arylsulfatases
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The sulfatase-modifying factor 1 (SUMF1, also called C-alpha-formylglycine-generating
  enzyme, FGE) (Preusser-Kunze et al. 2005, Cosma et al. 2003, Landgrebe et al. 2003)
  oxidises the critical cysteine residue in arylsulfatases to an active site formylglycine
  (3-oxoalanine) residue thus conferring sulfatase activity (Roeser et al. 2006).
  Defects in SUMF1 cause multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) (MIM:272200), an impairment
  of arylsulfatase activity due to defective post-translational modification of the
  cysteine residue (Cosma et al. 2003, Dierks et al, 2003). This post-translational
  modification is thought to be highly conserved in eukaryotes (Selmer et al. 1996,
  von Figura et al. 1998).  SUMF1 is active as either a monomer or a homodimer. A
  monomer is described in this reaction.

## Summary

The sulfatase-modifying factor 1 (SUMF1, also called C-alpha-formylglycine-generating enzyme, FGE) (Preusser-Kunze et al. 2005, Cosma et al. 2003, Landgrebe et al. 2003) oxidises the critical cysteine residue in arylsulfatases to an active site formylglycine (3-oxoalanine) residue thus conferring sulfatase activity (Roeser et al. 2006). Defects in SUMF1 cause multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) (MIM:272200), an impairment of arylsulfatase activity due to defective post-translational modification of the cysteine residue (Cosma et al. 2003, Dierks et al, 2003). This post-translational modification is thought to be highly conserved in eukaryotes (Selmer et al. 1996, von Figura et al. 1998).  SUMF1 is active as either a monomer or a homodimer.
