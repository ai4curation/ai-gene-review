stable_id: R-HSA-508292
display_name: SYK binds IL2RB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Syk binds to the serine-rich (aa 267 to 322) S region of IL2RB and becomes
  activated upon IL-2 stimulation (Minami et al. 1995).<br>Syk is shown here binding
  with the IL2:IL2RB trimer:p-JAK1:JAK3 complex but it may become associated at an
  earlier stage of receptor activation.
