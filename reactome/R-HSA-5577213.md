display_name: LTCC multimer transports Ca2+ from extracellular region to cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) transport Ca2+ into excitable
  cells. Isoforms CACNA1C, D, F and S form long-lasting (L-type) inward Ca2+ currents
  (I<sub>CaL</sub>) and play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling
  in the heart. LTCCs are multisubunit complexes consisting of alpha-1, alpha-2/delta,
  beta and gamma subunits in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (Brust et al. 1993). The alpha-2 and
  delta subunits in these complexes are chains of differing length cleaved from the
  same gene product (CACNA2D), linked by a disulfide bond (Calderon-Rivera et al.
  2012). Pore-forming alpha1 subunits are supported by the auxiliary alpha-2, delta
  and beta subunits which aid the membrane trafficking of the alpha1 subunit and modulate
  the kinetic properties of the channel (Klugbauer et al. 2003, Yang et al. 2011).
  The binding of various gamma subunits to alpha1 subunits may differentially modulate
  alpha1 subunit function in the heart (Yang et al. 2011). In heart pacemaker cells,
  phase 0 of the action potential depends upon LTCC-mediated Ca2+ current rather than
  the fast Na+ current. In cardiac pacemaker cells, phase 1 is due to the closure
  of LTCCs (and rapid efflux of K+). Specific subunits can form the LTCC in the heart
  are CACNA1C (pore-forming alpha subunit), CACNA2D2 (alpha-2:delta-2 subunit), CACNB1
  and CANCNB2 (either of these beta subunits) and CACNG4, 6, 7 and 8 (any of these
  gamma subunits).

## Summary

Voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) transport Ca2+ into excitable cells.
