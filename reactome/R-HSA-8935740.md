species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The RUNX1:CBFB complex can bind to the promoter of the ITGA2B (CD41) gene,
  encoding Integrin alpha-IIb, both in the absence and in the presence of PRMT1. PRMT1-mediated
  arginine-methylation significantly increases transcriptional activity of the RUNX1:CBFB
  complex at the ITGA2B promoter (Zhao et al. 2008). In addition to the RUNX1:CBFB
  complex, the complex of GATA1 and ZFPM1 (FOG1) (Freson et al. 2003) is also recruited
  to the ITGA2B promoter (Herglotz et al. 2013), likely through the interaction between
  GATA1 and RUNX1 (Elagib et al. 2003). The zinc finger domain of GATA1 is involved
  in binding to RUNX1 (Xu et al. 2006). Along with RUNX1 and GATA1, histone acetyltransferases
  p300 (EP300) and PCAF (KAT2B), as well as the WDR5-containing histone methyltransferase
  MLL complexes are also recruited to the ITGA2B promoter (Herglotz et al. 2013).
  Dimethylation of histone H3 on lysine residue K4 (K5 when taking into account the

  to the onset of differentiation (Herglotz et al. 2013). '

## Summary

The RUNX1:CBFB complex can bind to the promoter of the ITGA2B (CD41) gene, encoding Integrin alpha-IIb, both in the absence and in the presence of PRMT1. PRMT1-mediated arginine-methylation significantly increases transcriptional activity of the RUNX1:CBFB complex at the ITGA2B promoter (Zhao et al. 2008).
