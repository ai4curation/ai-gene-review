display_name: NOTCH1 HD+PEST domain mutants are cleaved by ADAM10/17 irrespective
  of ligand binding
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NOTCH1 HD domain mutants are cleaved at S2 and S3 sites to produce NEXT1
  and NICD1 fragments, respectively, in the absence of DLL/JAG ligand binding, although
  they are responsive to DLL/JAG ligands. NOTCH1 mutants containing in cis mutations
  in the HD and PEST domains are expected to be constitutively cleaved at the S2 site
  by ADAM10/17, like NOTCH1 HD domain mutants (Malecki et al. 2006), resulting in
  release of NEXT1 PEST domain mutant fragments.
