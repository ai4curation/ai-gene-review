species: Homo sapiens
summary: Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binds covalently and non-enzymatically
  to succinate dehydrogenase complex II (SDH) subunit A (SDHA). The exact mechanism
  is unclear but depends on the presence of succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor
  2 (SDHAF2, SDA5). Fumarate enhances the process (Hao et al., 2009; Maklashina et

## Summary

Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binds covalently and non-enzymatically to succinate dehydrogenase complex II (SDH) subunit A (SDHA). The exact mechanism is unclear but depends on the presence of succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 2 (SDHAF2, SDA5). Fumarate enhances the process (Hao et al., 2009; Maklashina et al., 2022).
