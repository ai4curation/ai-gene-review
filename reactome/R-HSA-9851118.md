display_name: pY-STAT3 binds the IRF4 promoter downstream of NPM1-ALK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'STAT3 binds to cognate binding sites in the promoter of IRF4 downstream
  of NPM-ALK as assessed by ChIP (Bandini et al, 2018). This finding is consistent
  with earlier studies demonstrating induction of IRF4 by STAT3 downstream of NPM-ALK
  (Marzec et al, 2013; Piva et al, 2010; Kasprzycka et al, 2006; Durant et al, 2010). '

## Summary

STAT3 binds to cognate binding sites in the promoter of IRF4 downstream of NPM-ALK as assessed by ChIP (Bandini et al, 2018). This finding is consistent with earlier studies demonstrating induction of IRF4 by STAT3 downstream of NPM-ALK (Marzec et al, 2013; Piva et al, 2010; Kasprzycka et al, 2006; Durant et al, 2010).
