display_name: CD28 homodimer binds B7-1 homodimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CD28 binding to B7-1 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) provides a crucial
  costimulatory signal that enhances T cell activation. This interaction modulates
  antigen recognition by T cells and ensures full activation in conjunction with T-cell
  receptor (TCR) engagement. Despite the homodimeric nature of CD28, it interacts
  with B7-1 in a manner that mimics a single binding site. The V-like domain of CD28
  features the conserved MYPPPY motif within the CDR3-analogous loop, which is critical
  for the recognition and binding of its ligands. Both B7-1 and B7-2 interact with
  CD28 at overlapping, though non-identical, binding sites, contributing to nuanced
  modulation of T cell activation (Linsley et al. 1994, Truneh et al. 1996).<br> CTLA4
  primarily affects CD28 costimulation by acting as a competitive inhibitor. CTLA-4
  has a much higher affinity for these ligands compared to CD28. When CTLA-4 binds
  to B7-1 or B7-2, it prevents these ligands from interacting with CD28, thereby reducing
  the costimulatory signals that are crucial for T cell activation (van der Merwe
  et al. 1997).
