stable_id: R-HSA-382053
display_name: Translocation of PDGF from ER to Golgi
species: Homo sapiens
summary: All the newly synthesized PDGF chains are dimerized in the ER and thereafter
  transferred to the Golgi complex for proteolytic processing. The four PDGF chains
  assemble into disulphide-bonded dimers via homo- or heterodimerization, and five
  different dimeric isoforms have been described so far; PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB,
  PDGF-CC and PDGF-DD.
