display_name: PEX2:PEX10:PEX12:Ub:PEX5S,L:PEX13:PEX14 binds PEX1:PEX6:PEX26 and ZFAND6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PEX1:PEX6:PEX26 (also known as the Receptor Export Module or peroxisomal
  AAA ATPase complex) extracts ubiquitinated PEX5S or PEX5L in the peroxisomal membrane
  (Tamura et al. 2006, Tamura et al. 2014). PEX1 and PEX6 are soluble proteins that
  form a hexameric ring bound to PEX26 in the peroxisomal membrane (Matsumoto et al.
  2003, Weller et al. 2005). ZFAND6 (AWP1) probably binds to ubiquitinated PEX5 and
  PEX6 and acts as an export factor (Miyata et al. 2012).
