summary: 'Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) proteins bind and release client polypeptides
  in a cycle of cochaperone-mediated conformational changes that is coupled to ATP
  binding and hydrolysis (Mayer MP 2013). The overall domain structure of all HSP70
  chaperone proteins is evolutionary conserved: the N-terminal nucleotide-binding
  domain (NBD) with ATPase activity is joined by a flexible linker to the C-terminal
  polypeptide substrate-binding domain (SBD). Most of our mechanistic understanding
  of HSP70 structure and function has come from analyses of Escherichia coli HSP70
  family member, DnaK (Pellecchia M et al. 2000; Schuermann, JP et al. 2008; Bertelsen
  EB et al. 2009; Kityk R et al. 2012; Qi R et al. 2013). Chaperone function of bacterial
  DnaK involves an allosteric control mechanism between its two functional domains
  NBD and SBD. ATP binding and hydrolysis modulates the affinity of bacterial HSP70
  protein for polypeptides, and polypeptide binding stimulates ATP hydrolysis (Mayer
  MP et al. 2000; Kityk R et al. 2012; Qi R et al. 2013). Also in the ATP-bound form,
  the lid domain remains open, which facilitates transient interactions with substrates.
  Following ATP hydrolysis, a conformational change releases the SBD, resulting in
  closure of the lid and a ~10-fold increase in the affinity for substrate (Wittung-Stafshede
  P et al. 2003; Slepenkov SV & Witt SN 2002). The conformation change associated
  with ATP hydrolysis is communicated through a key proline switch and involves the
  conserved, hydrophobic linker that connects the NBD to the SBD (Vogel M et al. 2006;
  Swain JF et al. 2007). ATP hydrolysis is essential for HSP70 chaperones, but the
  intrinsic ATPase rate is very low (Chang L et al. 2008). This ATPase activity of
  HSP70 is stimulated by protein substrates in synergism with J domain cochaperones
  (HSP40s) (Karzai AW & McMacken R 1996; Russell R et al. 1999; Laufen T et al. 1999;

  of eukaryotic and bacterial HSP70 proteins revealed that the human HSP70 SBD is
  highly homologous to the DnaK SBD (51% sequence identity in the full-length protein
  and 47% identity in the SBD) (Zhang P et al. 2014). Moreover, the crystal structure

## Summary

Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) proteins bind and release client polypeptides in a cycle of cochaperone-mediated conformational changes that is coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis (Mayer MP 2013). The overall domain structure of all HSP70 chaperone proteins is evolutionary conserved: the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) with ATPase activity is joined by a flexible linker to the C-terminal polypeptide substrate-binding domain (SBD).
