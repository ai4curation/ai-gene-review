display_name: ILF3 and HOXC8 bind CDH11 gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ILF3 (Interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3) binds to two out of four putative
  ILF3 binding sites in the CDH11 gene promoter, at positions -2982 to -2978, and
  -2602 to -2598 upstream from the start site. HOXC8 (Homeobox protein Hox-C8) co-occupies
  the CDH11 promoter with ILF3, and HOXC8 and ILF3 cooperatively promote CDH11 transcription
  (Zhang et al. 2017). HOXC8 binds to the CDH11 gene promoter at the position -196
  to -191, which is one of the three putative HOX protein-binding sequences in the
  CDH11 promoter (Li et al. 2014). Mouse Hoxc8 was also shown to bind to the mouse
  Cdh11 gene promoter (Lei et al. 2006) and upregulate mouse Cdh11 gene transcription
  (Lei et al. 2005, Lei et al. 2006).
