display_name: ERBB2 promotes PTK6 autophosphorylation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Binding of PTK6 (BRK) to activated ERBB2 receptor stimulates autophosphorylation
  of PTK6 on tyrosine residue Y342 (Xiang et al. 2008, Peng et al. 2015). Autophosphorylation
  at Y342 significantly increases catalytic activity of PTK6 (Qiu and Miller 2002).

## Summary

Binding of PTK6 (BRK) to activated ERBB2 receptor stimulates autophosphorylation of PTK6 on tyrosine residue Y342 (Xiang et al. 2008, Peng et al. 2015). Autophosphorylation at Y342 significantly increases catalytic activity of PTK6 (Qiu and Miller 2002).
