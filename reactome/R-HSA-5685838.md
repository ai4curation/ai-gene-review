stable_id: R-HSA-5685838
display_name: CX3 complex binds D-loop structures
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The CX3 complex, composed of RAD51 paralogs RAD51C and XRCC3 (Masson, Tarsounas
  et al. 2001), binds homologous recombination repair sites at a later time point
  than the BCDX2 complex (Chun et al. 2013). Both RAD51C and XRCC3 can directly interact
  with PALB2 (Park et al. 2014). CX3 complexes, as well as BCDX2 complexes, multimerize
  into ring like structures with a central cavity (Masson, Stasiak et al. 2001, Compton
  et al. 2010). The CX3 complex may be involved in the resolution of Holliday junctions
  (Liu et al. 2004, Liu et al. 2007).
