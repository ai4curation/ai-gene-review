summary: 'CDK12-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA
  polymerase II (RNA Pol II) subunit POLR2A (Rpb1) positively regulates transcription
  and, hence, expression of a set of DNA repair genes that encode long primary transcripts.
  CDK12, in complex with the TP53-regulated CCNK (cyclin K), phosphorylates POLR2A
  that was pre-phosphorylated by the CDK9-containing complex P-TEFb. CDK12-mediated
  phosphorylation of POLR2A is thought to increase the processivity of the RNA Pol
  II, enabling efficient transcription of long DNA repair genes (Blazek et al. 2011,
  Cheng et al. 2012, Bosken et al. 2014, Bartkowiak and Greenleaf 2015). CDK12 was
  shown to colocalize with the RNA Pol II complex at FANCD2, FANCI, ATM, CHEK1, MDC1,
  RAD51D and ATR gene loci (Ekumi et al. 2015) and to be necessary for achieving sufficient
  BRCA1 expression (Blazek et al. 2011). CDK12 positively regulates the expression
  of APEX1, involved in base excision repair (Liang et al. 2015). Recurrent CDK12
  mutations are found in ovarian cancer. These mutations affect either the catalytic
  cleft of CDK12 or disable the interaction of CDK12 with CCNK, resulting in the loss
  of CDK12 function. Ovarian tumors that harbour inactivating CDK12 mutations exhibit
  decreased BRCA1 levels, defective homologous recombination repair, increased sensitivity
  to DNA crosslinking agents, and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Joshi et al. 2014,
  Ekumi et al. 2015). '

## Summary

CDK12-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) subunit POLR2A (Rpb1) positively regulates transcription and, hence, expression of a set of DNA repair genes that encode long primary transcripts. CDK12, in complex with the TP53-regulated CCNK (cyclin K), phosphorylates POLR2A that was pre-phosphorylated by the CDK9-containing complex P-TEFb.
