display_name: Synthesis of PC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: <i>De novo</i> (Kennedy pathway) synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) involves
  phosphorylation of choline (Cho) to phosphocholine (PCho) followed by condensing
  with cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to form CDP-choline (CDP-Cho).  Diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and CDP-ETA together then form PC.  Alternatively, PC is formed when phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) is methylated by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) (Henneberry
  et al. 2002; Wright & McMaster 2002).
