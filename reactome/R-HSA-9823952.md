stable_id: R-HSA-9823952
display_name: EOMES, SMAD2,3, and GATA6 bind the CXCR4 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NODAL signaling in the primitive streak leads to the phosphorylation of SMAD2
  and SMAD3, which transit with SMAD4 to the nucleus and bind the promoter of the
  CXCR4 gene (inferred from human pluripotent stem cells in Brown et al. 2011). EOMES
  and GATA6, also expressed in the primitive streak, bind the CXCR4 promoter together
  with the SMADs and activate expression (inferred from human pluripotent stem cells
  in Chia et al. 2019).
