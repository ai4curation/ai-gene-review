stable_id: R-HSA-2691211
display_name: NOTCH1 HD domain mutants bind DLL4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: It has not been directly demonstrated that DLL4 binds to and activates NOTCH1
  HD (heterodimerization) domain mutants, but NOTCH1 HD domain mutants are expected
  to respond to DLL4 like they respond to DLL1 (Malecki et al. 2006).
