summary: 'The length of the polyisoprenoid chain of ubiquinone, aka coenzyme Q (CoQ),

  to ubiquinol (CoQ10H2 in humans), and this form dominates in human tissues. It functions
  as a ubiquitous coenzyme in redox reactions, and has a central role in the electron
  transport chain of the inner mitochondrial membrane.to shuttle electrons from complexes
  I and II to complex III. It also acts as a cofactor for biosynthetic and catabolic
  reactions, detoxifies damaging lipid species, and engages in cellular signaling
  and oxygen sensing. In eukaryotes, ubiquinones/ubiquinols are also found in other

  dioxygenase-like protein (HPDL) processes 4-hydroxphenylpyruvate (HPP, HPPA) to
  (S)-4-hydroxymandelate (4-HMA). HPDL defects lead to CoQ10 deficiency. The HPDL
  product 4-HMA is a precursor for the synthesis of 4-hydroxybenzoate (PHB), from
  which the CoQ10 head group is derived (Banh et al., 2021). Because HPDL is a mitochondrial
  protein, cytosolic HPP from tyrosine catabolism must either be imported by a yet

  mitochondrial reaction (Husain et al., 2020; reviewed in Staiano et al., 2023).

  linkage between PHB and the polyisoprenoid tail to produce 4-hydroxy-3-polyprenyl
  benzoic acid intermediate (DHB, 3-decaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid in humans). Modifications
  of the aromatic ring follow and involve an oxidative decarboxylation, two hydroxylations,
  two O-methylations, one C-methylation. This series of reactions, which precise order
  is not fully established, especially regarding the oxidative decarboxylation step
