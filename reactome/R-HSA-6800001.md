stable_id: R-HSA-6800001
display_name: TP53 family members stimulate FAS gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The p53 family members TP53 (p53), TP63 (p63), or TP73 (p73), most likely
  in complex with ASPP proteins PPP1R13B (ASPP1) or TP53BP2 (ASPP2) (Wilson et al.
  2013), bind p53 response elements in the first intron and/or promoter of the FAS
  gene, promoting FAS transcription (Schilling et al. 2009).
