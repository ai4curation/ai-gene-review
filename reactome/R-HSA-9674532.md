display_name: AAMP gene expression is positively regulated by VEGF
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Expression of the AAMP gene, encoding Angio-associated migratory cell protein,
  is positively regulated by VEGF in a dose- and time-dependent manner through an
  unknown mechanism (Hu et al. 2016). AAMP was first found to be expressed in blood
  vessels. High levels of AAMP are found in endothelial cells, cytotrophoblasts and
  cancer cell lines, and it is typically expressed in cells with a migratory phenotype,
  including vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, renal proximal tubular cells
  and activated T lymphocytes (Beckner et al. 1995, Beckner et al. 1999). At a subcellular
  level, AAMP localizes to the cytosol, to the plasma membrane, and to the extracellular
  matrix (Beckner et al. 1999, Hu et al. 2016). AAMP contains two Ig-homology domains,
  a putative membrane association domain and six WD40 repeats (Beckner et al. 1995,
  Reid et al. 2011). The WD40 repeats are predicted to be organized in a beta-propeller
  architecture, with a disorganized linker region between WD40 repeats 4 and 5 mapping
