display_name: KBTBD7:CUL3:RBX1 ubiquitinates NF1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NF1 levels are controlled by proteasomal degradation in response to stimulation
  by some growth factors (Cichowski et al, 2003).  Ubiquitination is mediated by the
  CUL3:RBX1 RING E3 ligase complex in conjunction with the BTB adaptor protein KBTBD7
  (Hollstein et al, 2013).  After its initial rapid degradation, NF1 protein levels
  are re-established shortly after growth factor treatment, allowing appropriate termination
  of RAS MAPK signaling (Cichowski et al, 2003). Aberrant destabilization of NF1 by
  CUL3:KBTBD7-mediated proteasomal degradation has been identified in cases of glioblastoma
  and depends on activation of PKC alpha  (Cichowski et al, 2003; McGillicuddy et
  al, 2009; Hollstein et al, 2013).
