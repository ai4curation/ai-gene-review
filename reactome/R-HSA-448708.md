display_name: IL24 binds to IL22RA1:JAK1:IL20RB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-24 (IL24) (and Interleukin-20 (IL20)) can activate a complex
  that consists of Interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL22RA1), which is associated
  with Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and Interleukin-20 receptor B (IL20RB)
  (Dumoutier et al. 2001, Parrish-Novak et al. 2002). As it is not clear whether the
  receptor can form in the absence of ligand, association of the ligand with the receptor
  trimer is represented here as an uncertain event.
