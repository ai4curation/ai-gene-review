stable_id: R-HSA-4420206
display_name: Phosphorylation of SRC-1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SRC is activated in vivo and in vitro in a VEGF/SH2D2A-dependent manner.
  VEGF induces phosphorylation of the activating Y418 residue, located on the c-SRC
  kinase activation loop, but also decreases phosphorylation of the negative regulatory
  Y527 (Sun et al. 2012).
