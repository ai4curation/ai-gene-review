stable_id: R-HSA-201810
display_name: The ligand trap binds the ligand BMP2, blocking BMP signalling
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BMP ligand traps are cystine-knot containing proteins which bind BMPs and
  antagonise their actions. They are active during organ development and morphogenesis.
  Different BMP ligand traps show specific spatio-temporal expression during development,
  and selective activity against specific BMP ligands.
