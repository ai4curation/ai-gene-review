display_name: PP2A dephosphorylates RAF1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Along with PPP5C-mediated dephophosphorylation of the NtA region, PP2A contributes
  to the inactivation of RAF1 by mediating the dephosphorylation of AL loop residues.  PP2A-mediated
  dephosphorylation of RAF1 may be stimulated by the prior hyperphosphorylation of
  RAF1 by MAPKs (Dougherty et al, 2005; reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011).
