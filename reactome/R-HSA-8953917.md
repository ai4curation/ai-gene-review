display_name: PEX2:PEX10:PEX12 binds PEX5S,L (in PEX5S:PEX13:PEX14) and Ub:UBE2D1,2,3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing PEX10, PEX12, and PEX2 ubiquitinates
  PEX5L. The PEX2:PEX10:PEX12 complex is believed to bind an activated E2-ubiquitin
  conjugate (one of Ub:UBE2D1, Ub:UBE2D2, Ub:UBE2D3) and PEX5L in a complex that also
  contains PEX13 and PEX14 (Chang et al. 1999, Carvalho et al. 2007, Grou et al. 2008,
  Grou et al. 2009, Okumoto et al. 2011). The short isoform of PEX5, PEX5S, is inferred
  to undergo the same reaction.
