display_name: NPM binds PKR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Nucleophosmin (NPM1, B23) binds inactive protein kinase R (PKR, EIF2AK2),
  preventing its activation, thereby stimulating protein translation and suppressing
  apoptosis. NPM1 can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytosol. It is currently
  unknown whether it binds to PKR in the nucleus or the cytosol, but here we represent
  this reaction occuring in the cytosol (Pang et al, 2003).
