stable_id: R-HSA-382052
display_name: p130Cas and C3G bind PDGFR bound Crk
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The presence of both SH2 and SH3 domains in Crk proteins is of crucial importance
  for their function as adaptor molecules. Crk forms complex with Cas, an SH3 domain-containing
  docking protein which has been shown to be phosphorylated after PDGF-stimulation
  of cells, and C3G, a nucleotide exchange protein which has been linked to the activation
  of JNK.
