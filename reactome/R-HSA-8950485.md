## Summary

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta (STAT1) are phosphorylated after Interleukin-27 (IL27) binds the Interleukin-27 receptor. In Interleukin-2 activated T cells, Interleukin-6 receptor beta subunit (IL6ST, gp130) has STAT3-docking sites, the result of tyrosine phosphorylation by Tyrosine protein-kinase JAK2 (JAK2) and/or Non receptor Tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (TYK2) and JAK1. <br><br>In human keratynocytes, Interleukin-12 (IL12) enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of STAT3, possibly mediated by JAK2, which is associated with Interleukin-12 receptor beta 2 subunit (IL12RB2).
