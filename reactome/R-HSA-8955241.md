display_name: CAND1 binds cytosolic CRL E3 ubiquitin ligases
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'CRL complexes consist of a cullin protein (CUL1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 5, 7 and
  9 in humans) and a RING box protein (RBX1 or 2) in addition to one or more substrate
  binding proteins that confer substrate specificity to the complex (reviewed in Petroski
  and Deshaies, 2005; Lipkowitz and Weismann, 2011). CRL complexes can be classes
  according to their cullin proteins: CRL1 complexes (also called SCF complexes) contain
  CUL1, CRL2 complexes contain CUL2, CLR complexes contain CUL3, and CLR5 complexes
  contain CUL5. Cullin-associated NEDD8-dissociated protein 1 (CAND1, TIP120) is a
  key assembly factor of Cullin E3 RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes, acting as
  a substrate receptor exchange factor. CAND1 binds to the inactive, deneddylated
  CRL complex through the conserved amino-terminal 3 Cullin repeats of the cullin
  subunit, which are also required for binding of the substrate binding proteins (Zheng
  et al, 2002a, b; Liu et al 2002; Min et al, 2003; Goldenberg et al, 2004). By disrupting
  the substrate binding protein interaction interface on the cullin proteins, CAND1
  binding destabilizes the CRL complex, allowing exchange of the substrate binding
  protein (Schmidt et al, 2009; Pierce et al, 2013; Zemla et al, 2013; Wu et al, 2013).
  Neddylation of the CRL complex results in a conformational change that eliminates
  the CAND1 binding site, thereby promoting the active CRL ubiquitin ligase complex
  (Duda et al, 2008; Saha and Deshaies, 2008; Boh et al, 2011; Yu et al, 2015).<br>'
