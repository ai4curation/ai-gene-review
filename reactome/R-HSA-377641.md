display_name: Clustering of Integrin alphaIIb beta3 complexes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The fibrinogen-bound integrin alphaIIb beta3 clusters platelets together
  to form a platelet plug and generates intracellular signals (outside-in) causing
  further platelet activation and platelet plug retraction.<br>Intracellular integrin
  alphaIIb beta3 clustering brings SRCs bound to integrin beta3 chains into proximity.
  SRC associates constitutively with integrin alphaIIb beta3. In unstimulated cells
  this SRC is inactive, auto-inhibited by an internal interaction between  phosphorylated
  Y530 and the SH2 domain. CSK is selective for the Y530 residue and prevents access
  to SRC of PTP1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that is capable of de-phosphorylating
  Y530.
