display_name: ATP binds G-protein beta associated TRiC/CCT
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Based on structural studies of the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex, the exchange
  of ADP for ATP enables conformational change of the chaperonin complex needed for
  folding of substrate proteins. It is assumed that TRiC/CCT-mediated folding of the
  G-protein beta subunit follows this universal pattern of TRiC/CCT functioning (Melki
  et al. 1997).
