stable_id: R-MMU-8868331
display_name: Cdk5:p25 phosphorylates Golga2
species: Mus musculus
summary: In a mouse Alzheimer's disease model, Cdk5, aberrantly activated by binding
  to p25, phosphorylates the Golgi membrane protein Golga2 (GM130) at serine residue
  S37, triggering the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (Sun et al. 2008). Please
  note that S37 of Golga2 is sometimes labeled as S25 in the literature because the
  recombinant Golga2 construct used in the original study of mitotic Golgi fragmentation
  (Lowe et al. 1998) lacked 12 N-terminal amino acids of Golga2.
