summary: 'SLC7A11 encodes one component of system xc-, a heterodimeric high affinity
  cystine-glutamate transporter that imports cystine in exchange for glutamate; the
  other protein component of the heterodimer is SLC3A2 (reviewed in Lewerenz et al,
  2013). System xc- contributes to redox balance of the cell by increasing intracellular
  stores of cysteine, a limiting component in the synthesis of the key antioxidant
  glutathione (GSH). Depletion of GSH, for instance by inhibition of SLC7A11, causes
  lipid peroxidation and stimulates ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death (reiewed
  in Chen et al, 2021; Kuang et al, 2020; Kajarabille and Latunde-Dada, 2019).

  Expression of SLC7A11 is regulated downstream of the KEAP1:NFE2L2 pathway in response
  to oxidative stress. NFE2L2 and SLC7A11 are therefore both negative regulators of
  ferroptosis (Ye et al, 2014; Ishii et al, 2000; Sasaki et al, 2002; Chen et al,
  2017; Dong et al, 2020; reviewed in Baird and Yamamoto, 2020; Kuang et al, 2020;
