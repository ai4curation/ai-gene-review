display_name: Defective POMT2 does not transfer Man from Dol-P-Man to DAG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Co expression of both protein O mannosyl transferases 1 and 2 (POMT1 and
  POMT2; CAZy family GT39) is necessary for enzyme activity, that is mediating the
  transfer of mannosyl residues to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues
  of proteins such as alpha dystroglycan (DAG1; MIM:128239). DAG1 is a cell surface
  protein that plays an important role in the assembly of the extracellular matrix
  in muscle, brain, and peripheral nerves by linking the basal lamina to cytoskeletal
  proteins. Defects in POMT2 (MIM:607439) results in defective glycosylation of DAG1
  and can cause severe congenital muscular dystrophy dystroglycanopathies ranging
  from a severe type A, MDDGA2 (brain and eye abnormalities; MIM:613150), through
  a less severe type B, MDDGB2 (congenital form with mental retardation; MIM:613156)
  to a milder type C, MDDGC2 (limb girdle form; MIM:603158) (Bertini et al. 2011,
  Wells 2013). Several mutations are known (MIM:607439), and mutations causing the
  severest type A2 form include R638*, T433* (van Reeuwijk et al. 2005), I444_N445insLLWQ,
  Y666C (Yanagisawa et al. 2009), V373F and I198N (Godfrey et al. 2007).
