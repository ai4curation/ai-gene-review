display_name: POM121 binds the Nup107-Nup160 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Based on studies in Xenopus (Fichtman et al. 2010) and human (Schwartz et
  al. 2015) models, POM121 binds the Nup107-160 complex through direct interaction
  with NUP133, a subunit of the Nup107-160 complex. Binding of POM121 to the Nup107-160
  complex precedes formation of the nuclear pore diffusion barrier (Dultz et al. 2008),
  and is followed by recruitment of FG repeat nucleoporins (Fichtman et al. 2010).
  FG nucleoporins contain phenylalanine-glycine repeats needed for interaction with
  soluble nuclear import and export receptors (Frey et al. 2006).
