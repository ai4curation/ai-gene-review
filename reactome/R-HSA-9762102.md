stable_id: R-HSA-9762102
display_name: NICD1 binds the NFE2L2 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NICD1, the NOTCH1 intracellular domain, binds to its cognate site in the
  promoter of the NFE2L2 gene as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay
  and chromatin immunoprecipitation (Wakabayashi et al, 2014). NFE2L2 is implicated
  in the progression of a number of cancers, supporting proliferation through metabolic
  reprogramming into the pentose phosphate pathway, and by increasing the antioxidant
  and detoxifying abilities of the cells (reviewed in He et al, 2020; Kitamura and
  Motohashi, 2018).
