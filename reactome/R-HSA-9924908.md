stable_id: R-HSA-9924908
display_name: CD274 mRNA binds miR-93 RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA-93 (miR-93) plays a critical role in controlling cell proliferation,
  invasion, apoptosis and senescence. miR-93-5p is studied extensively in cancer cells
  and its expression is altered in multiple cancer types (Cai et al, 2020, Chio et
  al, 2018). miR-93-5p plays a role in regulating CD274 (PD-L1) expression. Luciferase
  reporter assays have been used to show that miR-93-5p binds to the 3’ UTR of the
  PDL1 mRNA and suppresses its expression in breast cancer tissues and colorectal
  cancers (Yang et al., 2022, Chen et al., 2022).
