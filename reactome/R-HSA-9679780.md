display_name: SIGMAR1 binds fluvoxamine
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Among selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), fluvoxamine shows
  high affinity for sigma-1 receptors (SIGMAR1). Binding (Ishikawa et al. 2007) and
  stimulation of SIGMAR1 by fluvoxamine elicits antidepressive effects in rats (Yagasaki
  et al. 2006, Fishback et al. 2010). The endogenous ligand for SIGMAR1 may be progesterone
  (Ganapathy et al. 1999). Small anecdotal studies suggest that ligands that target
  SIGMAR1 may be useful in treating central hypoventilation syndromes (Loiseau et
  al. 2018), suggesting a possible role for such drugs in treatment of COVID-19 symptoms.
  After several trials for the use of fluvoxamine the US FDA rejected an Emergency<br>Use
  Authorization of Fluvoxamine, giving a detailed summary of results (FDA, 2022).
