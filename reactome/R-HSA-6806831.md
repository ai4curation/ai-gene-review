display_name: CYB5Rs reduce MetHb to HbA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NADH-Cytochrome b5 reductases (CYB5Rs), flavoproteins consisting of NADH
  and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domains, catalyse electron transfer
  from the two-electron carrier NADH to the one-electron carrier ferricytochrome b5
  ((Fe(3+)Cb5), forming ferrocytochrome b5 ((Fe(2+)Cb5) (Zhu et al. 1999, Baker et
  al. 2005, Zhu et al. 2004). CYB5Rs participate in fatty acid synthesis, cholesterol
  synthesis and xenobiotic oxidation as members of the electron transport chain on
  the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In erythrocytes, CYB5Rs participate in the reduction
  of methemoglobin (MetHb) to hemoglobin A (HbA).
