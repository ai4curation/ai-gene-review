display_name: Ivacaftor binds CFTR G551D
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Defects in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) can
  cause cystic fibrosis (CF; MIM:602421), a common generalised disorder in Caucasians
  affecting the exocrine glands. CF results in an ionic imbalance that impairs clearance
  of secretions, not only in the lung, but also in the pancreas, gastrointestinal
  tract and liver. Wide-ranging manifestations of the disease include chronic lung
  disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, blockage of the terminal ileum, male
  infertility and salty sweat. The class 3 mutations of CFTR such as G551D strongly
  decrease the time spent by CFTR in the open state (a gating defect). Results from
  2-phase clinical trials using VX-770 (aka Ivacaftor), a CFTR potentiator, showed
  an increased CFTR channel open probability in G551D patients. Ivacaftor use showed
  improvements in CFTR and lung function of patients with at least one G551D allele
  (Accurso et al. 2010, Ramsey et al. 2011, Kapoor et al. 2014). In 2012, the FDA
  approved Ivacaftor (under the trade name Kalydeco) for use in cystic fibrosis patients
  with the G551D mutation (Ledford 2012).
