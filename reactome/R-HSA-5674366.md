stable_id: R-HSA-5674366
display_name: IL17RD binds p-2S MAP2Ks and MAPKs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IL17RD, also known as SEF (similar expression to FGF), was identified as
  a negative regulator of nuclear MAPK signaling (Tsang et al, 2002; Furthauer et
  al, 2002). IL17RD is a spatial regulator of MAPK signaling that binds activated
  MAP2K dimers at the Golgi membrane and prevents the dissociation and translocation
  of phosphorylated MAPK into the nucleus. In this way, IL17RD restricts activation
  of nuclear MAPK targets while not affecting activation of cytosolic ones (Torii
  et al, 2004; reviewed in Phillips, 2004; Matallanas et al, 2011).
