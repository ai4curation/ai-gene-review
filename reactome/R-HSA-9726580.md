display_name: PGR binds PGR agonists
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The actions of progesterone, a critical regulator of normal female reproductive
  function  in the uterus, the ovary, the mammary gland and the brain, are mediated
  via the progesterone receptor (PGR). PGR agonists (Schindler et al. 2003, Kuhl 2005)
  are primarily used for birth control and as a part of menopausal hormone therapy
  and for the treatment of gynecological disorders. PGR agonists include the retroprogesterone
  dydrogestrone (Rižner et al. 2011), the 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone derivative medroxyprogesterone
  (Zhi et al. 1998), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives norethisterone (Edwards
  et al. 1998) and levonorgestrel (Bergink et al. 1983). '
