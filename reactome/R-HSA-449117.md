stable_id: R-HSA-449117
display_name: TXLNA (IL14) binds syntaxin1A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-14, renamed alpha-taxilin (TXLNA) was originally described as
  High molecular weight B-cell growth factor (Ambrus et al. 1994). TXLNA binds several
  forms of syntaxin (Nogami et al. 2003), but not when they are complexed with SNAP25,
  VAMP2 or STXBP1, suggesting that TXLNA interacts with syntaxins outside the SNARE
  complex. This observation and a predicted role in intracellular vesicle trafficking
  led to renaming of the gene. Txlna transgenic mice show a phenotype similar to systemic
  lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome (Shen et al. 2006).
