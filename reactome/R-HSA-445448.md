display_name: HHIP binds Hedgehog
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'HHIP is a Hh-binding transmembrane protein that antagonizes Hh signaling
  by sequestering the ligand away from PTCH.  HHIP is also a downstream target gene
  of Hh signaling, establishing a negative feedback loop that limits the extent of
  signaling  (Chuang et al, 1999; Chuang et al, 2003; Bosanac et al, 2009; Bishop
  et al, 2009: Holtz et al, 2013).  HHIP binds to all three Hh ligands, and also exists
  in a secreted form, which also sequesters ligand (Chuang et al, 1999; Coulombe et
  al, 2004).  HHIP expression is altered in some cancers that show upregulated Hh
  signaling (Olsen et al, 2004; Tada et al, 2008; Tojo et al, 2002).'
