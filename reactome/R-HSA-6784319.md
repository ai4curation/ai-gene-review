display_name: JAK1,TYK2 phosphorylate JAK1,TYK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Binding of IL-10 to its receptor causes phosphorylation and activation of
  the receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and TYK2 (Finbloom & Winestock
  1995), leading to phosphorylation of two conserved tyrosine residues (Y446 and Y496)
  within the intracellular domain of IL10RA, which serve as redundant docking sites
  for STAT3 (Ho et al. 1995, Weber-Nordt et al. 1996).<br><br>The details of JAK kinase
  activation are unclear. The classical model suggests that receptor dimerization,
  induced by ligand binding, brings the two JAK family kinases into proximity, so
  that they are able to trans-activate (phosphorylate) each other (Donnelly et al.
  1999, Waters et al. 2015) but it is also possible that ligand binding causes a conformational
  change in a pre-existing receptor dimer that withdraws trans pseudo-kinase inhibition
  for paired kinases, which then autophosphorylate (Waters et al. 2014, Waters & Brooks
  2015). JAK1, like all JAK kinases, has two adjacent tyrosines in its activation
  loop (Y1034, Y1035). It is not known which of these becomes phosphorylated in response
  to IL10 binding, or if phosphorylation at one site rather than the other has functional
  consequences. In vitro, phosphorylation at Y1034 has a greater enhancing effect
  on JAK1 catalytic ability (Wang et al. 2003) and is the more commonly observed phosphorylation
  site (see PhosphoSitePlus). Similarly TYK2 has two adjacent tyrosines, the first
  (Y1054) is the more commonly observed (see PhosphoSitePlus).
