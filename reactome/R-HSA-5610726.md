display_name: The IFT-A complex recruits TULP3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TULP3 is recruited to the primary cilium through a direct interaction with
  the retrograde transport IFT-A complex and with membrane phosphoinositides (Santagata
  et al, 2001; Mukhopadhyay et al, 2010; Qin et al, 2011; reviewed in Mukhopadhyay
  and Rohatgi, 2014).    TULP3 facilitates GLI processing by recruiting the GPCR GPR161,
  which in turn activates PKA by increasing cAMP levels in a G alpha s-dependent manner
  (Mukhopadhyay et al, 2013, reviewed in Hwang and Mukhopadhyay, 2014; Pal and Mukhopadhyay,
  2014).
