stable_id: R-HSA-2529020
display_name: CK2 phosphorylates condensin I subunits
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Protein levels of condensin subunits are constant during the cell cycle.
  Four subunits, SMC4, NCAPD2, NCAPG and NCAPH, are phosphorylated in interphase cells
  (Takemoto et al. 2004) by CK2 i.e. casein kinase II (Takemoto et al. 2006). Except
  for the phosphorylation of NCAPH subunit on serine residue S570, CK2 phosphorylation
  sites in condensin I subunits have not been identified. Phosphorylation by CK2 inhibits
  condensin I-mediated introduction of positive supercoils into DNA and chromatin
  condensation. Mitotic activation of condensin I involves removal of phosphate groups
  added by CK2 (Takemoto et al. 2006), but the responsible phosphatase has not been
  identified.
