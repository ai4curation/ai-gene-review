summary: The Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (STAT1)
  -Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) complex translocates
  from the cytosol to the nucleus. Interleukin-9 (IL9) stimulation induces STAT3 nuclear
  translocation and binding in vivo to the Eotaxin (CCL11) promoter (Yamasaki et al.
  2010, Gounni et al. 2004). Interleukin-9 (IL9) stimulation induces mucin5AC, junB
  and c-myc transcription (Longphre et al. 1999, Kang et al, 1995).<br><br> This is
  a black box event because this evidence shows STAT3 translocation, but not translocation
  of a STAT1:STAT3 dimer.
