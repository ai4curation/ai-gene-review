display_name: TWNK (PEO1) unwinds double-stranded mitochondrial DNA at the replication
  fork
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TWINKLE (TWNK, PEO1) binds DNA as a hexamer encircling the replication origin
  and employs energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind double stranded DNA in advance
  of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase POLgamma (POLG:POLG2) (Korhonen et al. 2004,
  Jemt et al. 2011, Sen et al. 2012, Khan et al. 2016, Kaur et al. 2020, Kaur et al.
  2021). The N-terminal region of TWNK binds DNA and stabilizes oligomerization while
  the C-terminal region contains ATPase activity and helicase activity (Johnson et
  al. 2023). TWNK is required for replication of circular DNA models in vitro (Korhonen
  et al. 2004, Wanrooij et al. 2008) and observation of Twnk knockout cells from mice
  indicate that TWNK is essential for nascent synthesis of the H strand in the D-loop
  at H strand origin of replication (OriH) in vivo (Milenkovic et al. 2013).
