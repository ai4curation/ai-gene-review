display_name: ARFGAPs stimulate ARF GTPase activity at the Golgi membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ARFGAP proteins stimulates ARF GTPase activity, promoting the release
  of the nascent COPI vesicle from the membrane and release of ARF:ADP (Tanigawa et
  al, 1993; reviewed in Beck et al, 2009; East and Kahn, 2011).  Although this reaction
  shows their dissociation, it is not clear whether ARFGAPs persist on the COPI vesicle
  after GTP hydrolysis, nor is it known when GBF is released from the nascent COPI
  vesicle.<br>
