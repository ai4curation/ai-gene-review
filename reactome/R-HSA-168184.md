display_name: Activated TAK1 mediates phosphorylation of the IKK Complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In humans, the IkB kinase (IKK) complex serves as the master regulator for
  the activation of NF-kappa-B by various stimuli. The IKK complex contains two catalytic
  subunits, IKK alpha (IKKa, IKK1 or CHUK) and IKK beta (IKKb, IKK2, IKBKB) associated
  with a regulatory subunit NEMO (IKK gamma or IKBKG). Each catalytic IKK subunit
  has an N-terminal kinase domain and leucine zipper (LZ) motifs, a helix-loop-helix
  (HLH) and a C-terminal NEMO binding domain (NBD). IKK catalytic subunits are dimerized
  through their LZ motifs. In the classical or canonical NF-kappa-B pathway, the activation
  of the IKK complex is dependent on the phosphorylation of IKKb (IKBKB) at its activation
  loop and the ubiquitination of IKBKG (NEMO) (Solt et al 2009; Li et al 2002). IKKb
  (IKBKB) is phosphorylated at Ser177 and Ser181 (Wang et al. 2001). IKBKG (NEMO)
  ubiquitination by TRAF6 is required for optimal activation of the IKK kinase activity;
  it is unclear if NEMO subunit undergoes K63-linked or linear ubiquitination. Activated
  IKK complex phosphorylates IkB alpha (IkBa or NFKBIA) on Ser32 and Ser36 leading
  to K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of IkB alpha.
  This leads to the release of active NF-kappa-B dimers.<p>This Reactome event shows
  phosphorylation of IKK beta (IKBKB) by TGF-β–activated kinase 1 (TAK1), encoded
  by the MAP3K7 gene. TAK1 functions downstream of receptor signaling complexes in
  TLR, TNF-alpha and IL-1 signaling pathways (Xu & Lei 2021). TAK1 appears to be essential
  for IL-1-induced NF-kappa-B activation since a specific TAK1 inhibitor (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol
  prevents NF-kappa-B activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)
  (Lammel 2020); also, it prevents NF-kappa-B-mediated TNF production in human myeloid
  leukaemia U937 cells (Rawlins et al. 1999). TAK1 functions through assembling the
  TAK1 complex consisting of the coactivators TAB1 and either TAB2 or TAB3 (Shibuya
  et al. 1996, Sakurai et al. 2000; Xu & Lei 2021). TAB1 promotes TAK1 autophosphorylation
  at the kinase activation lobe (Sakurai et al. 2000; Brown et al. 2005). The TAK1
  complex is regulated by polyubiquitination. The binding of TAB2 or TAB3 to polyubiquitinated
  TRAF6 may facilitate polyubiquitination of TAB2, -3 by TRAF6 (Ishitani et al. 2003),
  which in turn results in conformational changes within the TAK1 complex. TAB2 or
  -3 is recruited to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of receptor interacting protein
  (RIP) kinase RIP1 (RIPK1) via the Zinc finger domain of TAB2 or TAB3. RIPK1 functions
  as an essential component of inflammatory and immune signaling pathways. Ubiquitination
  of RIPK1 follows the recruitment of TRADD and TRAF2 or -5 (the latter functions
  as the E3 ubiquitin ligase, but also cIAP1,-2 can ubiquitinate RIPK1 as a response
  to TNF receptor engagement (Varfolomeev et al. 2008). The IKK complex is also recruited
  ubiquitin (Ub) chains via its Ub binding domain. Polyubiquitin chains may function
  as a scaffold for higher order signaling complexes bringing the TAK1 and IKK complexes
  in close proximity and allowing TAK1 to phosphorylate IKBKB (IKK2) (Kanayama et
  al. 2004).<p>The alternative (non-canonical) pathway can be activated via CD40,
  LTßR, BAFF, RANK, and is therefore limited to cells which express these receptors.
  It leads to NIK-mediated phosphorylation of IKKa (IKK1, CHUK), which phosphorylates
  the NFKB2 (p52) precursor p100, leading to the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of
  its C-terminal part (processing of p100 to the mature p52 subunit) and releasing
  the NFKB2:RelB complex (Sun 2017). In non-stimulated cells NIK is constitutively
  degraded by the cIAP1/2:TRAF2:TRAF3 Ub ligase complex; following stimulation, the
  complex is recruited to the respective receptor comlex where cIAPs ubiquitinates
  TRAF3, resulting it its degradation and stabilization of NIK. NIK then phosphorylates
  and activates IKK1 (CHUK), leading to the NFKB2:RelB complex activation (Sun 2017).
  TRAF3 deubiquitylation by OTUD7B downregulates the NIK-mediated NF-kappa-B activation.
  (Hu et al 2013). In addition, TAK1 has been shown to interact with NIK and with
  IKK2, and TAK1 can be stimulated by anti-apoptotic protein, XIAP (Hofer-Warbinek
  et al. 2000). XIAP is an NF-kB dependent gene, therefore its expression represents
  a positive regulatory circuit. NIK is also involved in the classical pathway, and
  is activated by TAK1 in the IL-1 signalling pathway (Ninomiya-Tsui et al. 1999)
  and Hemophilus influenzae-induced TLR2 signalling pathway (Shuto et al. 2001).<p>RNA-induced
  liquid phase separation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein serves as a platform
