summary: At the plasma membrane, subsequent phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol
  4-phosphate (PI4P) produces phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and
  phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) while the actions of various
  other kinases and phosphatases produces phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P),
  phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2),
  and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) (Zhang et al. 1997, Gurung
  et al. 2003, Guo et al. 1999, Vanhaesebroeck et al. 1997, Tolias et al. 1998, Schaletzky
  et al. 2003, Kim et al. 2002, Clarke et al. 2010). Many of the phosphatidylinositol
  phosphatases that act at the plasma membrane belong to the myotubularin family.
  Enzymatically inactive myotubularin family members can heterodimerize with catalytically
  active mytotubularins to regulate their stability, activity and/or substrate specificity
  (Berger et al. 2006, Zou et al. 2012).
