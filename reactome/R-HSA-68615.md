summary: 'ORC6 associates with the ORC(1-5) complex to form the ORC(1-6) complex (Ghosh
  et al. 2011). The association of ORC6 with the ORC(1-5) complex is weak and it frequently
  does not co-immunoprecipitate with the other ORC(1-5) subunits. ORC4 is the only
  ORC(1-5) subunit that was shown to directly bind to ORC6 (Radichev et al. 2006).
  Formation of the ORC(2-6) complex was demonstrated in vitro, but its biological
  significance, if any, is unknown (Ghosh et al. 2011). Some ORC6 mutations reported
  in Meier-Gorlin syndrome were shown to interfere with ORC6 incorporation into the
  ORC (Balasov et al. 2015). '

## Summary

ORC6 associates with the ORC(1-5) complex to form the ORC(1-6) complex (Ghosh et al. 2011). The association of ORC6 with the ORC(1-5) complex is weak and it frequently does not co-immunoprecipitate with the other ORC(1-5) subunits. ORC4 is the only ORC(1-5) subunit that was shown to directly bind to ORC6 (Radichev et al. 2006). Formation of the ORC(2-6) complex was demonstrated in vitro, but its biological significance, if any, is unknown (Ghosh et al. 2011). Some ORC6 mutations reported in Meier-Gorlin syndrome were shown to interfere with ORC6 incorporation into the ORC (Balasov et al. 2015).
