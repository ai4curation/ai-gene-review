summary: 'Mutagenesis experiments and functional studies suggest that phosphorylation
  of HSF1 residue Ser326 promotes induction of the HSF1 transcriptional competence

  sodium arsenite (Guettouche T et al. 2005; Chou SD et al. 2012).<p>The mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has been implicated in sensing intracellular
  protein misfolding (Qian SB et al. 2010; Chou SD et al. 2012).  RNA interference?mediated
  repression of mTOR kinase activity in human HeLa cells was found to increase sensitivity
  to heat shock. Moreover, inhibition of HSF1 phosphorylation on Ser326 by rapamycin
  suggests that this site in HSF1 is a target for the mTORC1complex (Chou SD et al.
  2012).
