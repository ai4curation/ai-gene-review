stable_id: R-HSA-4720446
display_name: HDAC4 SUMOylates NR1H3 (LXRalpha) with SUMO2,3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HDAC4 SUMOylates NR1H3 with SUMO2,3 (Ghisletti et al. 2007). SUMOylation
  is enhanced when NR1H3 binds specific oxysterols. SUMOylation causes NR1H3 to recruit
  the NCOR repressor and act as a transrepressor at promoters such as iNOS.
