stable_id: R-HSA-71262
display_name: Carnitine synthesis
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Carnitine is required for the shuttling of fatty acids into the mitochondrial
  matrix and its deficiency is associated with metabolic diseases. It is abundant
  in a typical Western diet but can also be synthesized in four steps from trimethyllysine
  (generated in turn by the S-adenosyl-methionine-mediated methylation of lysine residues
  in proteins, followed by protein hydrolysis). The enzymes that catalyze the first
  three steps of carnitine synthesis, converting trimethyllysine to gamma-butyrobetaine,
  are widely distributed in human tissues. The enzyme that catalyzes the last reaction,
  converting gamma-butyrobetaine to carnitine, is found only in liver and kidney cells,
  and at very low levels in brain tissues. Other tissues that require carnitine, such
  as muscle, are dependent on transport systems that mediate its export from the liver
  and uptake by other tissues (Bremer 1983; Kerner & Hoppel 1998; Rebouche & Engel
  1980; Vaz & Wanders 2002).
