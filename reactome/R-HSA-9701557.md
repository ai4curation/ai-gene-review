display_name: AcK685-p-Y705,S727 STAT3 and SIN3A bind the IL2RG promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Acetylated, phosphorylated STAT3 and SIN3A bind to the IL2RG promoter downstream
  of ALK signaling to repress expression (Gambi et al, 2019). Repression of IL2RG
  is also promoted by the STAT3-dependent recruitment of DNMT1, resulting in promoter
  demethylation (Zhang et al, 2011).

## Summary

Acetylated, phosphorylated STAT3 and SIN3A bind to the IL2RG promoter downstream of ALK signaling to repress expression (Gambi et al, 2019). Repression of IL2RG is also promoted by the STAT3-dependent recruitment of DNMT1, resulting in promoter demethylation (Zhang et al, 2011).
