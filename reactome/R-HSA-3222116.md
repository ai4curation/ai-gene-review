stable_id: R-HSA-3222116
display_name: L3MBTL1 binds TP53 monomethylated on K382
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The chromatin compaction factor L3MBTL1 binds TP53 (p53) monomethylated at
  lysine K382 by lysine methyltransferase SETD8 (SET8). L3MBTL1 binding to TP53 leads
  to chromatin reorganization at TP53-bound promoters, resulting in repression of
  gene transcription (West et al. 2010).
