display_name: Interaction of Csk with PAG
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Csk is a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates the negative regulatory C-terminal
  tyrosine residue Y505 of Lck to maintain Lck in an inactive state. In resting T
  cells, Csk is targeted to lipid rafts through engagement of its SH2 domain with
  phosphotyrosine residue pY317 of PAG. PAG is expressed as a tyrosine phosphorylated
  protein in nonstimulated T-cells. This interaction of Csk and PAG allows activation
  of Csk and inhibition of Lck. Given that PAG-1 T cell knock out show a weak phenotype,
  some other protein may substitute in activating Csk.
