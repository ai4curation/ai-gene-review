display_name: p-SPHK1 phosphorylates sphingosine to sphingosine 1-phosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Membrane-bound sphingosine (SPG) in cells attenuates basal Ras activity by
  stimulating the activity of Ras GTPase-activating proteins (RasGAPs). Upon its phosphorylation
  by SPHK1, SPG is converted to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) which then displaces
  from GAP downregulating RASA1 (p120GAP) activity and thereby induces Ras-GTP accumulation.
  This overall increases the level of activated Ras-GTP leading to activation of the
  ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and cell division (Shu et al.
  2002, Wu et al. 2003, Spiegel & Milstien 2006).
