stable_id: R-HSA-8948569
display_name: miR-19b microRNA binds PTEN mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA miR-19b, encoded by two genomic loci, MIR19B1 and MIR19B2, is homologous
  to miR-19a and also binds to the 3'UTR of PTEN mRNA (Polseno, Salmena, Zhang et
  al. 2010). miR-19b microRNA causes reduction in both PTEN mRNA and protein levels
  and is thus shown to function as a part of the endonucleolytic RISC. It is possible
  that miR-19b microRNA also functions as a part of the nonendonucleolytic RISC.
