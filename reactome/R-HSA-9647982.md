display_name: S-farn Me-HRAS, -NRAS and -KRAS4A are palmitoylated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'After carboxymethylation, HRAS, NRAS and KRAS4A are palmitoylated on cysteine
  residues upstream of the CaaX motif (residue C179 in KRAS4A, C181 in NRAS and C181
  and C184 in HRAS). KRAS4B lacks upstream cysteine residues and does not undergo
  palmitoylation (Hancock et al, 1989; Swarthout et al, 2005; reviewed in Gysin et
  al, 2011; Ahearn et al, 2018). Palmitoylation is catalyzed by the DHHC9:GOLGA7 complex
  at the Golgi membrane (Swarthout et al, 2008). '
