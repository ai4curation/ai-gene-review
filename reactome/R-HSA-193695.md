stable_id: R-HSA-193695
display_name: IRAK interacts with TRAF6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Neurotrophin binding to p75NTR leads to recruitment of TRAF6. This protein
  is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which, together with an E2 Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme,
  mediates the assembly of lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains and their attachment
  to a lysine of a substrate protein. Activation of IRAK1 promotes recruitment of
  TRAF6. TRAF6 is able to bind to  p75NTR (juxtamembrane region, residues 113-128),
  IRAK1 (N-terminal residues 1-198 and C-terminal residues 523-618), and MYD88. It
  might be recruited through the MYD88:IRAK1 complex.
