summary: 'In the final step of the 26S proteasome assembly, 19S regulatory particle
  precursor (19S RP) binds to the 20S core particle (20S CP). Through a poorly elucidated
  mechanism, chaperone proteins PAAF1 (ortholog of yeast Rpn14), PSMD10 (ortholog
  of yeast Nas6), and PSMD5 (ortholog of yeast Hsm3) are released from the base precursor
  and are not found in the 26S proteasome (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013).
  The cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of the mature human 19S RP
  confirmed that PAAF1 (Rpn14), PSMD10 (Nas6), and PSMD5 (Hsm3) were absent (Lu et
  al. 2017), implying that they are only transiently associated with 19S RP subunits,
  as shown in yeast. '
