stable_id: R-HSA-202307
display_name: Change of PKC theta conformation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'PKC theta localizes at the interface between T cells and antigen presenting
  cells. Upon the T cell activation and release of the second messengers Ca++ and
  DAG by PLC-gamma1, DAG binds to the C1 domain of the PKC theta thereby enhances
  the attachment to the plasma membrane. Upon membrane translocation, PKC theta is
  phosphorylated at tyrosine 90 in the C2 like domain. This phosphorylation is mediated
  by the tyrosine kinase Lck. These association and, most likely, other regulatory
  interactions, lead to a change in PKC theta conformation into an open, active state
  whereby it can now access its substrates and phosphorylate them. '
