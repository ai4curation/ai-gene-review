stable_id: R-HSA-9635936
display_name: ATF4 binds the CEBPB gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATF4 binds an enhancer downstream of the protein coding region of the CEBPB
  gene (Chen et al. 2005). The binding site resembles a composite CEBP-ATF element.
  Therefore ATF4 may form a heterodimer with a CEBP protein at the element (Chen et
  al. 2005).
