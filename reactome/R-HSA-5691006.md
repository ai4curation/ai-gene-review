summary: XPC, in complex with RAD23B or RAD23A and CETN2, employs a two-stage process
  to recognize a distorted DNA helix. In the first stage, XPC rapidly probes dsDNA,
  which is promoted by a DNA repulsive action of a negatively charged beta-turn extension
  of XPC, located in the vicinity of the XPC DNA-binding domain. In the second stage,
  the DNA binding domain, consisting of two beta hairpins, binds non-hydrogen bonded
  bases in dsDNA (Camenisch et al. 2009). Rad4, the yeast ortholog of XPC, recognizes
  lesions that thermodynamically disrupt normal Watson-Crick base pairing. Rad4 inserts
  a beta-hairpin through the DNA duplex, causing damaged base pairs to flip out of
  the double helix. Rad4 associates with the undamaged strand, whereas the DNA strand
  that contains damaged nucleotides becomes distorted (Min and Pavletich 2007).<p>Binding
  of the XPC:RAD23:CETN2 complex to distorted DNA is enhanced in the presence of the
  DDB1:DDB2 complex, also known as the UV-DDB complex. The UV-DDB complex preferentially
  binds UV-generated lesions, such as pyrimidine-pyrimidone photodimers (6-4 PPDs)
  and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), but also recognizes DNA with apurinic/apyrimidinic
  (AP) sites, and 2-3 bp mismatches (Fujiwara et al. 1999, Wittschieben et al. 2005).
  The DDB2 subunit of the UV-DDB complex is a WD40 repeat beta-propeller protein.
  The beta-propeller domain of DDB2 binds the damaged DNA strand (Scrima et al. 2008).
  The UV-DDB complex is part of a larger ubiquitin ligase complex that, besides DDB1
  and DDB2, also contains CUL4A or CUL4B and RBX1 (Groisman et al. 2003, Sugasawa
  et al. 2005). In the case of 6-4 PPDs and CPDs, UV-DDB binding to damaged DNA probably
  precedes the binding of the XPC:RAD23:CETN2 complex. However, in the case of 6-4
  PPDs, the XPC:RAD23:CETN2 complex may also recognize damaged DNA in the absence
  of the UV-DDB complex (Fitch et al. 2003, Moser et al. 2005, Wang et al. 2004),
  but the UV-DDB complex may be important for retention of DNA repair proteins at

## Summary

XPC, in complex with RAD23B or RAD23A and CETN2, employs a two-stage process to recognize a distorted DNA helix. In the first stage, XPC rapidly probes dsDNA, which is promoted by a DNA repulsive action of a negatively charged beta-turn extension of XPC, located in the vicinity of the XPC DNA-binding domain.
