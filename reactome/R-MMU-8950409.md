stable_id: R-MMU-8950409
display_name: Il27ra binds Jak1
species: Mus musculus
summary: The cytoplasmic domain of Interleukin-27 receptor subunit alpha (Il27ra)
  has a Box-1 motif which is important for binding to Janus kinases family of proteins
  (Sprecher et al. 1998). Mouse Interleukin-27 receptor alpha (Il27ra, WTX-1) has
  been shown to directly associate with Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (Jak1) as well
  as Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (Stat1) (Takeda
  et al. 2003). Coimmunoprecipitation studies and pull-down assays suggest that the
  Il27ra directly associates with Jak1 and that one of its tyrosin residues provides
  a docking site for Stat1 when phosphorylated.
