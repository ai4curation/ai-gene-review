display_name: Alpha-defensins form biologically active dimers
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The crystal structure of human alpha-defensin HNP-3 revealed that it forms
  a dimer containing a six-stranded beta-sheet region (Hill et al. 1991). NMR studies
  indicate that HNP-1 can also form dimers or higher-order aggregates in solution
  and artificial lipid bilayers (Zhang et al. 1992, 2010a, 2010b). Models of alpha
  and beta defensins suggest that dimerization and/or higher order structures are  characteristic,
  though not univeral or required for the biological effects of some beta-defensins
  (Suresh & Verma 2006, Pazgier et al. 2006).
