stable_id: R-HSA-77591
display_name: Binding of Cleavage factors and Poly(A)Polymerase to the CstF:CPSF:Pre-mRNA
  Complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CF I, which appears to be composed of two subunits, one of several related
  larger polypeptides and a common smaller one, also binds RNA, but with unknown specificity.
  RNA recognition by these proteins is cooperative. Cleavage also requires CF II,
  composed of at least two subunits, and poly(A) polymerase, the enzyme synthesizing
  the poly(A) tail in the second step of the reaction.

## Summary

CF I, which appears to be composed of two subunits, one of several related larger polypeptides and a common smaller one, also binds RNA, but with unknown specificity. RNA recognition by these proteins is cooperative. Cleavage also requires CF II, composed of at least two subunits, and poly(A) polymerase, the enzyme synthesizing the poly(A) tail in the second step of the reaction.
