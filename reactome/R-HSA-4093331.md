stable_id: R-HSA-4093331
display_name: Ras:GTP binds p120-RasGAP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: p120-RasGAP (RASA1) binds to activated Ras (Ras:GTP) through its GAP-related
  catalytic domain, which is sufficient for stimulating the Ras GTPase activity. p120-RasGAP
  accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras to promote Ras inactivation (Yao
  et al. 1995).
