  (SPN) is an adaptor that links the assembled snRNP to the nuclear transport machinery,

## Summary

The nuclear import signal has two parts; Cap hypermethylation triggers nuclear import via snurportin1 binding and by receptor recognition of the Sm proteins. Snurportin1 (SPN) is an adaptor that links the assembled snRNP to the nuclear transport machinery, recruiting importin beta for nuclear import. The import receptor that recognizes the Sm proteins is not yet known.
