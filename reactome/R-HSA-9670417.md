species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activation of STAT signaling suggests that STATs dimerize downstream of activating
  KIT mutations as is the case with the wild-type receptor, although this hasn't been
  directly demonstrated in all cases (Brizzi et al, 1999; Ning et al, 2001; Frost
  et al, 2002; Growney et al, 2005; Hara et al, 2017; Obata et al, 2017; Duensing
  et al, 2004; Bauer et al, 2007; Deberry et al, 1997; Ronnstrand, 2004; reviewed
  in Lennartsson and Roonstrand, 2012).
