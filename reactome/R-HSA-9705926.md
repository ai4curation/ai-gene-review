summary: Endogenous androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are steroid
  hormones that regulate the development and maintenance of male characteristics in
  vertebrates through their binding to the androgen receptor (AR) (Tóth & Zakár 1982,
  Askew et al. 2007, Brinkmann 2011). They are synthesised from cholesterol in the
  testes, ovaries and the adrenal glands. Synthetic androgen agonists (AR agonists)
  are used in androgen replacement therapy to counter the effects of male hypogonadism
  (diminished functional activity of the gonads) (Rey & Grinspon 2020), to help with
  menopausal symptoms (Marina et al. 2020), in delayed puberty, the prophylactic treatment
  of hereditary angioedema (Bork 2018), the treatment of endometriosis (Simitsidellis
  et al. 2018, Gibson et al. 2020), muscle wasting (Woerdeman & de Ronde 2011, von
  Haehling 2017), erectile dysfunction (Morgunov et al. 2007, Aversa et al. 2019),
  osteoporosis (Chen et al. 2019) and to treat breast cancer in women (Kono et al.
  2016, Kono et al. 2017, Chen et al. 2020, Basaria et al. 2001, Shahidi 2001).<br><br>Both
  natural and synthetic androgens can act as anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS, commonly
  called anabolic steroids). AASs can contribute to increases in body weight, often
  as lean mass increases can see gains in muscular strength and performance enhancement.
