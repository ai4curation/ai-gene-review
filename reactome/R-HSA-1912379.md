display_name: Transport of fringe-modified NOTCH to plasma membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Fringe-modified NOTCH functions at the plasma membrane. The transport of
  fringe-modified NOTCH to the plasma membrane from Golgi has not been studied directly,
  but is assumed to share properties of transport of mature NOTCH receptors that are
  not modified by fringe.
