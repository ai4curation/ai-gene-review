stable_id: R-HSA-186826
display_name: GRB2:SOS1 complex binds to the active receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GRB2 is an adaptor molecule containing one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains.
  The SH2 domain of GRB2 binds directly to autophosphorylated PDGF receptors and with
  its SH3 domain it forms a complex with SOS1. The binding of GRB2:SOS1 to the PDGF
  receptor juxtaposes the complex towards RAS molecules leading to RAS activation.
  RAS activates the MAP kinase cascade, a pathway implicated in cell growth stimulation,
  migration and differentiation.<br>
