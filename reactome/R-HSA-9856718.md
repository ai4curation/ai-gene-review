species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mitochondrial 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like protein (HPDL) was
  shown to process 4-hydroxphenylpyruvate (HPPA) to (S)-4-hydroxymandelate (4-HMA).
  HPDL defects lead to CoQ10 deficiency, and the HPDL product 4-hydroxymandelate apparently
  is a precursor for the synthesis of 4-hydroxybenzoate, which is a prerequisite for
  the assembly of the CoQ10 head group (Banh et al., 2021). Because HPDL is a mitochondrial
  protein, cytosolic HPPA from tyrosine catabolism must be imported by an unknown
  transport mechanism (Husain et al., 2020; reviewed in Staiano et al., 2023).
