stable_id: R-HSA-376200
display_name: SLC7A10-mediated uptake of small neutral amino acids
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SLC7A10, complexed with SLC3A2 in the plasma membrane, mediates the uptake
  of small neutral amino acids. The process is Na+-independent. As measured by Northern
  blotting SLC7A10 is widely expressed in the body (Nakauchi et al. 2000).
