summary: The mineralocorticoid receptor (Nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member
  2, NR3C2) is a receptor with equal affinity for both mineralocorticoids (MC) such
  as aldosterone and glucocorticoids (GC) such as corticosterone or cortisol. NR3C2
  is expressed in many tissues such as kidney, heart, the CNS and sweat glands. Its
  activation leads to the expression of proteins regulating ionic and water transport
  resulting in the reabsorption of sodium. Consequently, there is an increase in extracellular
  volume, an increase in blood pressure, and increased excretion of potassium to maintain
  normal salt concentrations.<br><br>Synthetic NR3C2 antagonists competitively inhibit
  NR3C2 (Kagawa et al. 1957, Pollow et al. 1992, Rupprecht et al. 1993) in the kidney
  distal convoluted tubule to promote sodium and water excretion and potassium retention.
  These diuretic drugs are typically indicated for congestive heart failure, hypertension
  and chronic kidney disease. Synthetic antagonists of NR3C2 include the steroidal
  compounds spironolactone, eplerenone, and drospirenone. Nimodipine, a calcium channel
  blocker, can also act as an NR3C2 antagonist (Dietz et al. 2008, Luther 2014).<br><br>The
  broad clinical use of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists is limited
