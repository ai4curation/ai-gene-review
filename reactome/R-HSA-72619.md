display_name: 'eIF2:GTP is hydrolyzed, eIFs are released '
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once the Met-tRNAi has recognized the AUG, eIF2-bound GTP is hydrolyzed.
  The reaction is catalyzed by eIF5 (or eIF5B) and is thought to cause dissociation
  of all other initiation factors and allow joining of the large 60S ribosomal subunit.  Release
  of the initiation factors from 40S leaves the Met-tRNAi in the ribosomal P-site
  base-paired to the start codon on the mRNA.
