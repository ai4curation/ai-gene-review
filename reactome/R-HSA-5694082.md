display_name: XK:KEL:Zn2+ cleaves EDN3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Kell blood group glycoprotein (KEL) is a zinc endopeptidase with endothelin-3-converting
  enzyme activity which can preferentially cleave endothelin-3 (EDN3), an endothelium-derived
  vasoconstrictor peptide. EDN3 is cleaved at Trp21-Ile22 to form the bioactive peptide
  EDN3(97-117) (Lee et al. 1999). KEL forms a heterodimer with membrane transport
  protein XK (Russo et al. 1998).
