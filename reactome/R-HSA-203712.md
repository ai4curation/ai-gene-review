stable_id: R-HSA-203712
display_name: eNOS associates with Caveolin-1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Caveolin-1 is the primary negative regulatory protein for eNOS.  Caveolin-1
  binding to eNOS compromises its ability to bind Calmodulin (CaM), thereby inhibiting
  enzyme activity.  The major binding region of caveolin-1 for eNOS is within amino
  acids 60-101 and to a lesser extent, amino acids 135-178 (Garcia-Cardena et al.
  1997; Ghosh et al. 1998).
