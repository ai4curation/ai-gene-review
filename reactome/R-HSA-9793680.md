species: Homo sapiens
summary: Optineurin (OPTN, also called FIP2 and NRP), is a multifunctional adaptor
  protein that contains several domains including two coiled-coil domains, a leucine
  zipper (LZ) domain, an LC3-interacting region (LIR), a ubiquitin-binding domain
  (UBD), and a zinc finger (ZF) domain. OPTN has been implicated in regulating various
  signaling pathways including NF-kappa-B activation, TBK1-mediated type I interferon
  production, programmed cell death, and autophagy (reviewed in Markovinovic A et
  al. 2017; Slowicka K & van Loo G 2018; Toth RP & Atkin JD 2018). OPTN has been identified
  as a negative regulator of the tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α)-induced signaling
  pathway that targets several downstream components including receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), caspase 8 (CASP8) and ubiquitin (Ub)
  carboxyl-terminal hydrolase CYLD (Zhu G et al. 2007; Nagabhushana A et al. 2011;
  Nakazawa S et al. 2016). TNF-α binding to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) results in the
  sequential formation of several signaling complexes that trigger inflammatory responses
  and cell survival or cell death (Walczak H 2011; Ofengeim D & Yuan J 2013). The
  rapidly forming complex-I (TNFR1 signaling complex) is assembled at the receptor’s
  cytoplasmic tail. The components of this complex, including RIPK1, are rapidly conjugated
  with Ub chains by various E3 ligases (Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003; Yuan J et al.
  2019). The ubiquitination status (K63-, M1-linked or Ub-free) of RIPK1 determines
  cell fate downstream of the TNFR1 signaling complex. OPTN has been shown to associate
  with TNFR1 and RIPK1 by coimmunoprecipitation in a TNF-α-stimulated mouse embryonic
  fibroblasts (MEF) (Zhu G et al. 2007) and human epithelial carcinoma KB cell line
  (a subclone of HeLa cells) (Klingseisen L et al. 2012) suggesting that OPTN is recruited
  to the TNFR1 complex. In OPTN-deficient HeLa cells, IP assays show enhanced association
  of TNFR1 with ubiquitinated RIPK1 and two subunits of linear ubiquitin chain assembly
  complex (LUBAC), HOIL-1L and SHARPIN Nakazawa S et al. 2016). In contrast, overexpression
  of OPTN suppresses these associations within the TNFR1 signaling complex suggesting
  that OPTN binding downregulates the TNFR1 complex activity (Nakazawa S et al. 2016).
  Further, endogenous OPTN immunoprecipitates with polyubiquitinated RIPK1 in TNF-α-stimulated
  HeLa cells (Zhu G et al. 2007; Nakazawa S et al. 2016) and with anti-linear Ub antibody
  in TNF-α-stimulated HEK293T cells (Nakazawa S et al. 2016). <i>In vitro</i> pull-down
  assays show that maltose-binding protein (MBP)-fused OPTN (Nakazawa S et al. 2016)
  or glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused OPTN (Gleason CE et al. 2011) can be copurified
  with M1- and K63-linked polyubiquitin, but not K48-linked polyubiquitin. Structural
  studies further confirm that OPTN functions through its ability to bind polyubiquitinated
  proteins showing that the UBD of OPTN preferentially recognizes linear M1-linked
  Ub chains (Nakazawa S et al. 2016; Li F et al. 2018). A surface plasmon resonance
  (SPR) analysis has revealed that OPTN binds to M1-linked Ub with the micromolar
  affinity (Nakazawa S et al. 2016). These findings suggest that the Ub-binding activity
  of OPTN downregulates the TNF-α-induced signaling pathway by targeting RIPK1 function
  within the TNFR1 signaling complex (Zhu G et al. 2007; Nakazawa S et al. 2016).
  However, the precise role of OPTN downstream of TNFR1 remains unclear. TNF-α was
  found to induce OPTN expression in an NF-kappa-B-dependent manner in human lung
  adenocarcinoma A549 cells and HeLa cells (Sudhakar C et al. 2009). OPTN was shown
  to suppress activation of NF-kappa-B in TNF-α-stimulated HeLa cells (Sudhakar C
  et al. 2009; Nakazawa S et al. 2016) and human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells
  (Munitic I et al. 2013). In addition, increased NF-kappa-B activity has been observed
  in OPTN-deficient mouse microglial BV2 cells, neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells and hybrid
  NSC-34 cells produced by fusing neuroblastoma and spinal-cord motor neurons (Akizuki
  M et al. 2013; Maruyama H et al. 2010; Cao LL et al. 2021). Further, the UBD-disrupting
  mutant OPTN D474N as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated mutation
  OPTN E478G, prevent binding of OPTN to polyUb (Gleason CE et al. 2011; Nakazawa
  S et al. 2016) and fail to suppress TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappa-B activation in
  human and mouse cells (Zhu G et al. 2007; Sudhakar C et al. 2009; Maruyama H et
  al. 2010; Nakazawa S et al. 2016). Elevated expression of RIPK1 and downregulated
  expression of OPTN has been detected in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients
  and the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD (Cao LL et al. 2021). Intracerebroventricular
  injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding OPTN to APP/PS1 mice reduces
  neuroinflammation in microglial cells and astrocytes via RIPK-dependent NF-kappa-B
  pathways (Cao LL et al. 2021). Although OPTN is believed to downregulate TNF-induced
  inflammation, in <i>ex vivo</i> studies in various primary cells, including bone
  marrow-derived macrophages, microglia and MEFs isolated from OPTN-deficient or OPTN-insufficient
  mice (carrying point mutation D477N or C-terminal truncation, which cannot bind
  polyubiquitin), OPTN had no effect on NF-kappa-B signaling, suggesting that the
  mechanism of OPTN-mediated regulation is indirect and/or depends on the NF-kappa-B-mediated
  upregulation of OPTN expression (Sudhakar C et al. 2009; Gleason CE et al. 2011;
  Munitic I et al. 2013; Slowicka K et al. 2016; Markovinovic A et al. 2018; reviewed
  in Slowicka K & van Loo G 2018; Prescott JA et al. 2021). Further, ectopic overexpression
  of OPTN results in decreased protein levels of RIPK1 without affecting the mRNA
  levels of RIPK1 in BV2 cells, suggesting that OPTN may regulate RIPK1 activity by
  enhancing RIPK1 degradation (Cao LL et al. 2021). Moreover, OPTN-deficient mice
  developed neuropathology resembling one aspect of ALS namely dysmyelination, and
  this neuropathy was associated with RIPK1-dependent induction of necroptosis in
  the spinal cord and was linked to decreased K48-ubiquitination and turnover of RIPK1
  (Ito Y et al 2016). However, dysmyelination was not confirmed in a follow-up study
  (Dermentzaki G et al. 2019), which showed that unmanipulated Optn-deficient mice
  had no phenotype and that OPTN-deficiency had an effect on RIPK1 <i>in vitro</i>
  but not <i>in vivo</i>. The same study did not find any significant changes in RIPK1
  levels in motor cortex samples from patients with ALS (Dermentzaki et al. 2019).
  Further research is needed to clarify the role of RIPK1-induced necroptosis in the
  pathogenesis of ALS (Ito Y et al 2016; Dermentzaki et al. 2019). Moreover, as an
  autophagy receptor, OPTN binds polyubiquitinated cargos through its UBD and delivers
  them to autophagosomes via LIR-mediated interaction with microtubule-associated
  protein 1A/1B (MAP1LC3 or LC3), a key initiator of autophagy. The autophagy receptor
  function of OPTN is enhanced by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-mediated phosphorylation
  of OPTN (Li F et al. 2018). The N-terminal coiled-coil domain of OPTN directly interacts
  with the C-terminal domain of TBK1 to form a stable complex (Li F et al. 2018).
  Both OPTN and TBK1 have been shown to associate with the components of the TNFR1
  signaling complex in the M1 (or K63)-linked polyUb-dependent manner to alter RIPK1
  function (Zhu G et al. 2007; Nakazawa S et al. 2016; Lafont E et al. 2018; Xu D
  et al. 2018; Taft J et al. 2021). Notably, TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of OPTN
  on S473 has been shown to broaden the binding specificity of OPTN to other polyubiquitin
  chains including K48-linked polyUb (Li F et al. 2018). Similar to OPTN, TBK1 deficiency,
  which is embryonically lethal (Bonnard M et al. 2000), results in the TNF-α-stimulated
  hyperactivation of RIPK1 kinase activity leading to necroptosis <i>in vitro</i>
  and <i>in vivo</i> (Xu D et al. 2018; Taft J et al. 2021). Mutations of TBK1 that
  cannot bind OPTN have been linked to ALS and a related neurodegenerative diasease,
  frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (Freischmidt A et al. 2015; Cirulli ET et al. 2015).
  Further, TBK1 deficiency shows limited effect on TNF-induced gene expression in
  human A549 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (Lafont E et al. 2018). Thus, OPTN
  may participate in the crosstalk between TNF-α-induced cell death signaling and
  cytoprotective autophagy by targeting RIPK1-containing complexes for autophagic
  degradation. Besides RIPK1, OPTN may control the TNF-α-induced signaling by binding
  CYLD (Nagabhushana A et al. 2011) and pro-CASP8 (Nakazawa S et al. 2016). In addition,
  the OPTN:TBK1 axis regulates host immune responses downstream of pattern-recognition
  receptors (PRR) such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) or retinoic-acid-inducible protein
  1 (RIG-I, also known as DDX58) (Meena NP et al. 2016; Pourcelot M et al. 2016; Markovinovic
  A et al. 2018; O’Loughlin T et al. 2020). OPTN has been shown to translocate to
  Golgi-proximal foci in human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in response
  to TLR3 ligand (poly(I:C)) and DDX58 ligand (pppRNA) (O’Loughlin T et al. 2020).
  OPTN-interacting proteins, including TBK1, CYLD and components of the LUBAC complex,
  have been identified in these foci, suggesting that OPTN inhibits the PRR-mediated
  innate immune response through sequestering key components of NF-kappa-B and TBK1:IRF3
  signaling pathways in the perinuclear compartment (O’Loughlin T et al. 2020).<p>This
