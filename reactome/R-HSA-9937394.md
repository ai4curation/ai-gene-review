display_name: 55S ribosome:MTRF1 hydrolyzes peptidyl-tRNA bond and GTP is hydrolyzed
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MTRF1 terminates translation at the noncanonical codons AGA, located in the
  MT-ND6 mRNA, and AGG, located in the MT-CO1 mRNA (Nadler et al. 2022, Krüger et
  al. 2023, Saurer et al. 2023, reviewed in Krüger et al. 2024). Binding of MTRF1
  causes distortion of the mRNA and interaction of the first two bases of the termination
  codon, the rRNA of the 28S subunit, MTRF1, and adjacent bases of the mRNA (Saurer
  et al. 2023). Depletion of MTRF1 causes reduced translation of MT-CO1 (Nadler et
  al. 2022, Krüger et al. 2023, Saurer et al. 2023). MTRF1 contains the conserved
  GGQ motif that is found in the peptidyl hydrolase domain of other translation release
  factors, therefore MTRF1 may participate in cleaving the nascent polypeptide from
  the peptidyl-tRNA (reviewed in Krüger et al. 2024).

## Summary

MTRF1 terminates translation at the noncanonical codons AGA, located in the MT-ND6 mRNA, and AGG, located in the MT-CO1 mRNA (Nadler et al. 2022, Krüger et al. 2023, Saurer et al. 2023, reviewed in Krüger et al. 2024). Binding of MTRF1 causes distortion of the mRNA and interaction of the first two bases of the termination codon, the rRNA of the 28S subunit, MTRF1, and adjacent bases of the mRNA (Saurer et al. 2023). Depletion of MTRF1 causes reduced translation of MT-CO1 (Nadler et al. 2022, Krüger et al. 2023, Saurer et al. 2023). MTRF1 contains the conserved GGQ motif that is found in the peptidyl hydrolase domain of other translation release factors, therefore MTRF1 may participate in cleaving the nascent polypeptide from the peptidyl-tRNA (reviewed in Krüger et al. 2024).
