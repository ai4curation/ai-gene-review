stable_id: R-HSA-9925095
display_name: CD274 mRNA binds miR-340 RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA-340 (miR-340) plays a critical role in osteoclast differentiation
  and tumor progression. It has been extensively studied for its expression and role
  in cell proliferation, metastasis and osteoporosis (Zhao et al., 2017, Huang et
  al., 2021). miR-340 binds to the 3’UTR of CD274 (PD-L1) mRNA and suppresses its
  translation (Dong et al., 2019).
