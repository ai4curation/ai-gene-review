summary: 'Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 (IRF4) is a winged-helix-turn-helix transcription
  factor that binds to interferon (IFN)-stimulated response elements in promoters
  of IFN-responsive genes. IRF4 is expressed in melanocytes, melanoma cell lines and
  in most melanomas and is associated with human pigmentation (Grossman et al, 1996;
  Sundram et al, 2003; Sulem et al, 2007; Han et al, 2008).<br>Expression of IRF4
  in melanoma cells and in zebrafish is regulated by the binding of MITF-M and TFAP2A
  to cognate binding sites located in intron 4, as assessed by ChIP, EMSA and reporter
  gene assay (Kenny et al, 2005; Praetorius et al, 2013). Studies in murine melanocytes
  and in mouse support a role for IRF4 in mouse pigmentation in a manner that depends
  on MITF (Praetorius et al, 2013).<br>Consistent with a role for TFAP2A in promoting
  IRF4 expression, a naturally occurring SNP in intron 4 of IRF4 that impairs binding
  of TFAP2A to its site decreases expression of IRF4 (Praetorius et al, 2013). TFAPA2
  and TFAP2C, the two TFAP family members with the highest expression in melanocytes,
  appear to work cooperatively with MITF to activate a subset of target genes involved
  in proliferation and pigmentation. TFAP family members may act as ''pioneer'' transcription
  factors for MITF, increasing MITF binding and chromatin accessibility (Kenny et
