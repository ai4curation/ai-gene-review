display_name: Phosphorylation of IL2RB Y338, Y392 or Y510 enables STAT recruitment
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mutation analysis has shown that Y338, Y392 and Y510 are involved in IL-2-induced
  STAT protein binding. Phospho-tyrosines 338, 392 and 510 can each promote STAT5
  activation (Gaffen et al. 1996), though Y510 appears to be the primary site for
  STAT5 binding (Gesbert et al. 1998). STAT3 may also be recruited to phospho-tyrosines
  on IL2RB and studies have shown defective IL-2 responses in STAT3-/- T cells, thereby
  supporting a functional role for STAT3 downstream of IL-2 signaling (Akaishi et
  al. 1998).
