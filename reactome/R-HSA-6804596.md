stable_id: R-HSA-6804596
display_name: APAF1:CYCS binds APIP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The APAF1 interacting protein (APIP) is an endogenous regulators of the apoptosome
  apparatus. APIP is thought to bind to the CARD domain of APAF1 preventing procaspase-9
  recruitment to the apoptosome (Cho DH et al., 2004; Cao G et al., 2004; Kang W et
  al. 2014). Moreover, during hypoxic conditions, APIP may also induce sustained activation
  of AKT and ERK1/2 kinases, which directly phosphorylate procaspase-9 to inhibit
  its activation in the apoptosome (Cho DH et al., 2007).
