display_name: nsp12 acquires Fe-S cluster cofactors
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The catalytic subunit nsp12 of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase interacts
  with parts of the host's iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis machinery, which facilitates
  Fe-S cluster transfer from the main scaffold protein, ISCU. Coordination of nsp12
  with two 4Fe-4S clusters was confirmed, ligated by cysteine residues located in
  two sites previously identified in cryo-EM structures as zinc-binding. Functionally
  the clusters are required for the RNA polymerase activity of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8
  complex, in addition to presumably maintaining structure. This function can be partially
  restored by zinc ions (Maio et al, 2021).
