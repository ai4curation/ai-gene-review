stable_id: R-HSA-3000310
display_name: AURKA phosphorylates PLK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AURKA (Aurora A kinase) phosphorylates PLK1 on threonine residue T210 that
  lies in the conserved aurora kinase consensus site (Seki et al. 2008). PLK1 needs
  to be phosphorylated on T210 to become catalytically active (Jang et al. 2002).
  BORA, but not other AURKA co-activators, facilitate PLK1 phosphorylation by AURKA
  (Macurek et al. 2008, Seki et al. 2008).
