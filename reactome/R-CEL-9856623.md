display_name: ATFS-1 translocates from the cytosol to the nucleoplasm
species: Caenorhabditis elegans
summary: ATFS-1 contains both a nuclear localization sequence and a mitochondrial
  targeting sequence (Nargund et al. 2012). In unstressed cells, ATFS-1 is efficiently
  imported into mitochondria, where it is degraded by LON-P (Nargund et al. 2012).
  Upon mitochondrial stress that causes a reduction in mitochondrial import of proteins,
  less ATFS-1 is imported into mitochondria, ATFS-1 accumulates in the cytosol, and
  a greater amount of ATFS-1 is imported into the nucleus (Nargund et al. 2012, Nargund
  et al. 2015).
