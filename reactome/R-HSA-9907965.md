display_name: PSMD9 binds PSMC3:PSMC6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The subcomplex of the proteasome 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) base, the
  PSMC3:PSMC6 dimer (orthologous to the yeast Rpt5:Rpt4 dimer) binds the chaperone
  protein PSMD9 (orthologous to yeast Nas2) (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013).
  Formation of the endogenous heterotrimer between PSMD9 (Nas2, also known as p27),
  PSMC3 (Rpt5), and PSMC6 (Rpt4) was demonstrated in human embryonic kidney cell line
  HEK293T (Kaneko et al. 2009). Using recombinant human proteins, it was shown that
  PSMD9 directly interacts with PSMC3 but not PSCM6 (Kaneko et al. 2009). Knockdown
  of PSMD9 decreases protein levels of both PSMC3 and PSMC6 (Kaneko et al. 2009).
