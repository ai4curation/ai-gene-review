display_name: HSP90:FKBP4:PTGES3 binds HSF1 trimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Under non-stress conditions monomeric HSF1 is sequestered in a HSP90-containing
  heterocomplex. FKBP4 (immunophilin) is one of the components of HSP90-chaperone
  machinery which was found to associate with trimeric, but not monomeric form of
  HSF1 (Guo Y et al. 2001). Multichaperone complex of HSP90:FKBP4:PKGES3 has been
  shown to associate with HSF1 trimer through its regulatory domain, and this is thought
  to repress HSF1 transcriptional activity (Guo Y et al. 2001). <br><br>
