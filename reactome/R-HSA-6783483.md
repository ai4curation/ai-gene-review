stable_id: R-HSA-6783483
display_name: tRNA:XPOT:RAN:GTP translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The nuclear export receptor XPOT (Exportin-t) interacts with both tRNA (Li
  and Sprinzl 2006) and RAN:GTP and the complex is translocated from the nucleus to
  the cytosol through the nuclear pore (Arts et al. 1998, Kutay et al. 1998, Kuersten
  et al. 2002, reviewed in Leisegang et al. 2012). RAN:GTP-dependent interactions
  of XPOT with components of the nuclear pore may increase the efficiency of the transport
  cycle (Kuersten et al. 2002).

## Summary

The nuclear export receptor XPOT (Exportin-t) interacts with both tRNA (Li and Sprinzl 2006) and RAN:GTP and the complex is translocated from the nucleus to the cytosol through the nuclear pore (Arts et al. 1998, Kutay et al. 1998, Kuersten et al. 2002, reviewed in Leisegang et al. 2012). RAN:GTP-dependent interactions of XPOT with components of the nuclear pore may increase the efficiency of the transport cycle (Kuersten et al. 2002).
