display_name: Removal of plus-strand flap and gap closure complete synthesis of linear
  duplex viral DNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The fate of the discontinuous viral DNA duplex synthesized in the cytosol
  of an infected cell by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is not entirely clear. Studies
  of some viral systems suggest that this discontinuous structure is required for
  passage of the viral duplex DNA into the nucleus  while there are evidence contrary
  to this observation. Studies in vitro indicate that human nuclear flap endonuclease
  and DNA ligase can remove the flap and seal the plus-strand discontinuity in HIV-1
  DNA (Miller et al. 1995; Rausch and Le Grice 2004; Rumbaugh et al. 1998), although
  role of flap is not yet clear.
