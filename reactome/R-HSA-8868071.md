display_name: Clathrin recruits PIK3C2A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PIK3C2A is a member of the class II PI 3 kinases, and phosphorylates PI(4)P
  to PI(3,4)P2 at the plasma membrane. PIK3C2A interacts with clathrin through a clathrin-binding
  domain in its unique N-terminal tail and localizes to late-stage clathrin-coated
  pits (Domin et al, 2000; Gaidarov et al, 2001; Gaidarov et al, 2005).  Binding to
  clathrin stimulates the kinase activity of PIK3C2A and promotes the production of
  PI(3,4)P2 at the plasma membrane (Gaidarov et al, 2001).  PI(3,4)P2 formation by
  PIK3C2A contributes to maturation of clathrin-coated pits by promoting the recruitment
  of BAR-domain containing proteins such as SNX9, which stimulate membrane curvature
  required for vesicle formation and eventual fission (Posor et al, 2013; reveiwed
  in Daumke et al, 2014).

## Summary

PIK3C2A is a member of the class II PI 3 kinases, and phosphorylates PI(4)P to PI(3,4)P2 at the plasma membrane. PIK3C2A interacts with clathrin through a clathrin-binding domain in its unique N-terminal tail and localizes to late-stage clathrin-coated pits (Domin et al, 2000; Gaidarov et al, 2001; Gaidarov et al, 2005).  Binding to clathrin stimulates the kinase activity of PIK3C2A and promotes the production of PI(3,4)P2 at the plasma membrane (Gaidarov et al, 2001).  PI(3,4)P2 formation by PIK3C2A contributes to maturation of clathrin-coated pits by promoting the recruitment of BAR-domain containing proteins such as SNX9, which stimulate membrane curvature required for vesicle formation and eventual fission (Posor et al, 2013; reveiwed in Daumke et al, 2014).
