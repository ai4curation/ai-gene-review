stable_id: R-HSA-1474184
display_name: DHNTP is dephosphorylated by PTPS to PTHP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydrobiopterin synthase (PTPS) (Takikawa et al. 1986) catalyses
  the second step in BH4 biosynthesis, the dephosphorylation of DHNTP to 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin
  (PTHP). PTPS is believed to function as a homohexamer (Nar et al. 1994, Bürgisser
  et al. 1994) and has a requirement for Zn2+ (one Zn2+ ion bound per subunit) and
  Mg2+ ions for activity (Bürgisser et al. 1995). The phosphorylation of Ser-19 is
  an essential modification for enzyme activity (Scherer-Oppliger et al. 1999).
