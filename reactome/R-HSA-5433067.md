display_name: DPEPs hydrolyse glycine from AFXBO-CG, AFNBO-CG
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the formation of mercapturic acid from glutathione conjugates, first a
  glutamate residue is hydrolysed from the conjugate then a glycine residue (Gly).
  Dipeptidases 1 and 2 (DPEP1,2) perform this second hydrolysis. DPEP3, previously
  thought to function similarly, has more recently been shown to lack dipeptidase
  activity (Hayashi et al. 2020). They are membrane-bound, homodimeric enzymes which
  require zinc ions for activity. DPEP1 has been characterised (Satoh et al. 1993,
  1994, Nitanai et al. 2002) whereas DPEP2 is thought to function as DPEP1 based on
  similarity.
