stable_id: R-HSA-8952903
display_name: ADPRHL2 hydrolyses poly(ADP-ribose)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Important cellular processes such as DNA repair, cellular differentiation,
  and carcinogenesis are regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Previously, only the
  nuclear protein poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) has been identified to hydrolyse
  poly(ADP-ribose). Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase ARH3 (ADPRHL2) is a mitochondrial
  matrix protein (Niere et al. 2008) structurally unrelated to PARG but possessing
  PARG activity (Oka et al. 2006). ADPRHL2 is able to hydrolyse poly(ADP-ribose) in
  mitochondria (Niere et al. 2012).
