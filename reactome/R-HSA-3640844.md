stable_id: R-HSA-3640844
display_name: RNF146 binds RibC-AXIN:TNKS complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RNF146 is an E3 RING ubiquitin ligase that was identified as a positive regulator
  of WNT signalling (Callow et al, 2011; Zhang et al, 2011).  Depletion of RNF146
  increases the levels of AXIN and decreases expression of WNT target genes and WNT-responsive
  reporters in a WNT-independent manner (Zhang et al, 2011; Callow et al, 2011). RNF146
  binds directly to poly-ADP-ribose groups through its WWE domain and ubiquitinates
  substrates in a tankyrase-dependent manner (Zhang et al, 2011).  AXIN, Tankyrase
  and RNF146 are thought to exist in a complex (Callow et al, 2011) and RNF146 mediates
  the tankyrase-dependent ubiquitination of all three proteins to promote their degradation
  (Callow et al, 2011; Zhang et al, 2011).  In this reaction, only the targeted degradation
  of AXIN is depicted.
