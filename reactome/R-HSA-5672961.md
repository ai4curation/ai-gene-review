species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon growth factor stimulation, RAF1 S259 (or S365 and S214 in BRAF and ARAF
  respectively) is dephosphorylated by PP2A and/or PP1, abrogating one of the YWHAB/14-3-3
  binding sites (Terai et al, 2005; Ory et al, 2003; Kubicek et al, 2002; Jaumot et
  al, 2001; Rommel et al, 1996; reviewed in Roskoski, 2010; Matallanas et al, 2011).  Release
  of 14-3-3 binding from the N-terminal site promotes a conformational change that
  exposes the membrane and RAS interacting RBD and CRD and facilitates recruitment
  of RAF to the plasma membrane where it binds RAS:GTP (Kubicek et al, 2002; Goetz
  et al, 2003; Ory et al, 2003). Dephosphorylation of S259/S365/S214 may also promote
  dimerization of RAF monomers by replacing the intramolecular 14-3-3 binding interaction
  with an intermolecular one (Rushworth et al, 2006; Weber et al, 2001; Ritt et al,
  2010; reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011).  Although the PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation
  is shown as occurring before both YWHAB displacement and recruitment of RAF to the
  plasma membrane, the order of and relationship between these events is not completely
  clear.  In addition, the displacement of 14-3-3 and recruitment of RAF1 to the membrane
  is also promoted by a direct interaction with cell cycle protein Prohibitin (PHB;
  Rajalingam et al, 2005; reviewed in Rajalingam and Rudel, 2005; Chowdhury et al,
  2014).
