display_name: Activated FGFR2 mutants:p-FRS2 binds GRB2-SOS1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activation of FGFR mutants has in some cases been shown to result in phosphorylation
  of both FRS2 (also known as FRS2alpha) and ERK1/2, suggesting activation of the
  MAPK pathway through wild-type like recruitment of the GRB2-SOS1 complex (reviewed
  in Wesche, 2011; see for instance, Weiss, 2010; Dutt, 2011; Raffioni, 1998; Hart,
  2000).
