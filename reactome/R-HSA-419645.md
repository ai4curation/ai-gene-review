display_name: Dimerization of LIMK1 by Hsp90
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After phosphorylation on Thr 508, LIMK undergoes homodimerization. Homodimer
  formation is promoted by the binding of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) to a short
  sequence in the kinase domain of LIMKs. LIMKs are further phosphorylated after homodimer
  formation and transphosphorylation of the kinase domain.

## Summary

After phosphorylation on Thr 508, LIMK undergoes homodimerization. Homodimer formation is promoted by the binding of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) to a short sequence in the kinase domain of LIMKs. LIMKs are further phosphorylated after homodimer formation and transphosphorylation of the kinase domain.
