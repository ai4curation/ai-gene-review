display_name: p-S585-IL3RB binds 14-3-3 proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The common beta chain (Bc), binds 14-3-3 zeta at a site that requires phosphorylation
  of Serine 585 (Stomski et al. 1999). Bc modifications that prevent Ser-585 phosphorylation
  do not recruit 14-3-3 zeta (Guthridge et al. 2000).
