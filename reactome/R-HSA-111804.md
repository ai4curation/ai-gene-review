summary: 'Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR (M1M2B)) catalyzes the reduction of adenine,
  guanine, cytidine, and uridine ribonucleoside 5''-diphosphates (NDPs) to form the
  corresponding deoxyribonucleoside 5''-diphosphates, coupled to the oxidation of
  thioredoxin (Eklund et al. 2001). The enzyme complex is cytosolic (Pontarin et al.
  2008). The form of ribonucleotide reductase annotated here is a tetramer of two
  large (M1) and two small (M2B) subunits (Shao et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2005). M2B
  protein is stable throughout the cell cycle, unlike M2, and is induced by TP53 (Guittet
  et al. 2001; Tanaka et al. 2000). The RNR (M1M2B) complex can thus provide dNDPs
  for DNA repair in interphase and quiescent cells. Studies of mitochondrial instability
  in cells from patients deficient in M2 protein indicate that RNR (M1M2B) likewise
  provides dNDPs for mitochondrial DNA replication (Pontarin et al. 2012). The overall
  activity of the enzyme is regulated allosterically: ATP binding is stimulatory while

## Summary

Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR (M1M2B)) catalyzes the reduction of adenine, guanine, cytidine, and uridine ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates (NDPs) to form the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates, coupled to the oxidation of thioredoxin (Eklund et al. 2001). The enzyme complex is cytosolic (Pontarin et al. 2008). The form of ribonucleotide reductase annotated here is a tetramer of two large (M1) and two small (M2B) subunits (Shao et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2005). M2B protein is stable throughout the cell cycle, unlike M2, and is induced by TP53 (Guittet et al. 2001; Tanaka et al. 2000). The RNR (M1M2B) complex can thus provide dNDPs for DNA repair in interphase and quiescent cells.
