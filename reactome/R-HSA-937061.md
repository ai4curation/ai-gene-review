display_name: 'TRIF (TICAM1)-mediated TLR4 signaling '
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRIF (TICAM1) was shown to induce IRF3/7 and NF-kappa-B activation as well
  as apoptosis through distinct intracellular signaling pathways (Yamamoto M et al.,
  2003; Fitzgerald KA et al., 2003; Han KJ et al., 2004; Kaiser WJ & Offermann MK
  2005). <p>TRIF consists of an N-terminal domain (NTD) (1-153), an intermediate disordered
  proline-rich region, a TIR domain, and a C-terminal region (Mahita J & Sowdhamin
  R 2017). The disordered proline-rich region between NTD domain and the TIR domain
  of TICAM1 contains binding sites for TRAF (TNF receptor associated factor) family
  proteins, which, in turn, recruit protein kinases to promote activation of IRF3
  and/or NF-kappa-B (Sato S et al., 2003; Fitzgerald KA et al., 2003). The C-terminal
  region of TICAM1 (TRIF) can recruit receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  kinase 1 (RIPK1), and this event is followed by the activation of the IKK complex
  or the induction of programmed cell death (Han KJ et al., 2004; Kaiser WJ & Offermann
  MK 2005).
