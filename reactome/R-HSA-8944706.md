stable_id: R-HSA-8944706
display_name: miR-21 nonendonucleolytic RISC binds PTEN mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: miR-21-5p, one of the two mature products of miR-21, binds the 3'UTR of PTEN
  mRNA to inhibit PTEN mRNA translation. miR-21 only affects PTEN protein level and
  thus presumably functions as part of the nonendonucleolytic RISC (Meng et al. 2007,
  Zhang et al. 2010)
