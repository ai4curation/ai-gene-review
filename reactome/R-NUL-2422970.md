display_name: Phosphorylation of Gorasp1, Golga2 and RAB1A by CDK1:CCNB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The existence of Gorasp1:Golga2:Uso1:Rab1:GTP complex was established by
  co-immunoprecipitation of exogenously expressed human RAB1A (identical sequence
  to rat Rab1A) from normal rat kidney cells, NRKs (Moyer et al. 2001). It was also
  shown that human RAB1B binds human GM130 (Weide et al. 2001). In mitotic prophase,
  human CDK1 (CDC2) in complex with either CCNB1 (cyclin B1) or CCNB2 (cyclin B2),
  as both CCNB1 and CCNB2 can localize to Golgi (Jackman et al. 1995, Draviam et al.
  2001), was shown to phosphorylate recombinant rat Gorasp1 and Golga2, as well as
  RAB1A (Bailly et al. 1991, Lowe et al. 1998, Preisinger et al. 2005) . Phosphorylation
  of Golga2 and RAB1A impairs their association with Uso1 (Lowe et al. 1998, Seeman
  et al. 2000, Moyer et al. 2001).

## Summary

The existence of Gorasp1:Golga2:Uso1:Rab1:GTP complex was established by co-immunoprecipitation of exogenously expressed human RAB1A (identical sequence to rat Rab1A) from normal rat kidney cells, NRKs (Moyer et al. 2001). It was also shown that human RAB1B binds human GM130 (Weide et al. 2001). In mitotic prophase, human CDK1 (CDC2) in complex with either CCNB1 (cyclin B1) or CCNB2 (cyclin B2), as both CCNB1 and CCNB2 can localize to Golgi (Jackman et al. 1995, Draviam et al. 2001), was shown to phosphorylate recombinant rat Gorasp1 and Golga2, as well as RAB1A (Bailly et al. 1991, Lowe et al. 1998, Preisinger et al. 2005) . Phosphorylation of Golga2 and RAB1A impairs their association with Uso1 (Lowe et al. 1998, Seeman et al. 2000, Moyer et al. 2001).
