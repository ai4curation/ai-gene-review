display_name: SARS-CoV-2 N protein binds STAT1, STAT2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Type I interferon (IFN-I) immune signaling is dampened in COVID-19, and the
  SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein produces this effect (Li et al, 2020; Oh & Shin,
  2021). Specifically, N binds to both STAT1 and STAT2, prevents their phosphorylation,
  and suppresses their nuclear translocation induced by IFN. The N-terminal 1-361
  amino acids of SARS-CoV-2 N protein are sufficient for its IFN-I antagonizing activity
  (Mu et al, 2020).
