display_name: YWHAB dimer dissociates from dephosphorylated RAF
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Dephosphorylation of S259 (S365/S214) by PP2A promotes the transient dissociation
  of 14-3-3 dimers from this site (Ory et al, 2003; Jaumot et al, 2001; Rommel et
  al, 1996; reviewed in Raabe and Raap, 2003; Matallanas et al, 2011). In the case
  of RAF1, displacement of 14-3-3 has also been shown to be promoted by a direct interaction
  between RAF1 and the cell cycle protein prohibitin (PHB; Rajalingam et al, 2005;
  reviewed in Rajalingam and Rudel, 2005; Chowdhury et al, 2014).<br>
