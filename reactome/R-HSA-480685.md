display_name: POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG bind the SOX2 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, and NANOG bind distinct sites in the promoter of the
  SOX2 gene (Boyer et al. 2005, Jin et al. 2007, Lister et al. 2009, Jung et al. 2010).
  The set of target genes of POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG includes POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG
  themselves, thus their expression is a component of an autoregulatory loop  (Boyer
  et al. 2005, Chew et al. 2005, Rodda et al. 2005, Babaie et al. 2007, Jung et al.
  2010, Goke et al. 2011).
