display_name: RUNX3 binds CTNNB1:TCF7L2,(LEF1,TCF7L1,TCF7)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RUNX3 forms a ternary complex with beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and its binding
  partner TCF7L2 (TCF4). In addition to TCF7L2, RUNX3 is also able to interact with
  LEF1, TCF7L1 (TCF3) and TCF7 (also known as TCF1). The interaction involves the
  Runt domain of RUNX3 and the HMG box of TCF7L2 (Ito et al. 2008).
