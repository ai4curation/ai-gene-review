display_name: YWHAZ binds p-CBY:CTNNB1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 14-3-3 proteins, represented here as YWHAZ, bind directly to CBY1 after AKT-dependent
  phosphorylation of CBY1 serine 20.  Tagged versions of beta-catenin, CBY1 and 14-3-3/YWHAZ
  expressed in HEK293 cells co-immunoprecipitate in a CBY1-phosphorylation dependent
  manner.  14-3-3/YWHAZ binding promotes sequestration of CBY1 and beta-catenin in
  the cytoplasm, thus antagonizing beta-catenin-dependent transcription (Li et al,
  2008).
