display_name: ACTA2 gene expression is stimulated by NOTCH1, NOTCH2 and NOTCH4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ACTA2 gene, encoding smooth muscle alpha actin, possesses several RBPJ (CSL)
  response elements in its promoter region. Transcription of ACTA2 is positively regulated
  by NOTCH1, NOTCH2 and NOTCH4 (Tang et al. 2008).
