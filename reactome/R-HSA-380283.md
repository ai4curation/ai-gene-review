## Summary

Microtubule nucleation at the centrosome is mediated by the gamma tubulin ring complex (gamma TuRC) (reviewed in Raynaud-Messina and Merdes, 2006; Wiese and Zheng, 2006). In humans, this large complex contains the tubulin superfamily member gamma-tubulin, five gamma complex proteins (GCP2-GPC6) and NEDD1/GCP-WD. A current model of the arrangement of subunits within the gamma-TuRC proposes that 6-7 TuSC subcomplexes are held together by the other Grip proteins (at an unknown stoichiometry), which together form the cap subunits. 
In many animal cells, the recruitment of gamma-tubulin complexes to the centrosome rapidly increases (3–5 fold ) before mitosis  to support the formation of new spindle microtubules (Khodjakov and  Rieder 1999).  NEDD1/GCP-WD  plays  an essential role in recruitment of these complexes to the centrosomes (Haren et al., 2006;  Luders et al., 2006) and to the mitotic spindle (Luders et al., 2006). GCP-WD/NEDD1  associates directly with the  gamma-TuRC.  The carboxy-terminal half  binds to the gamma-TuRC  whereas the amino-terminal half, corresponding to the WD-repeat domain,  is responsible for its attachment  to the centrosome (Haren et al., 2006).
