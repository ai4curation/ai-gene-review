display_name: REV1 recruits POLZ to (AP:Cyt)-DNA Template
species: Homo sapiens
summary: REV1, bound to the replication complex, recruits DNA polymerase zeta (POLZ,
  REV3L:MAD2L2) to the damaged DNA template. REV3L does not bind REV1 directly. Instead,
  REV3L binding to MAD2L2 (REV7) during the formation of POLZ complex causes a conformational
  change in MAD2L2 that allows the C-terminal domain of MAD2L2 to bind the C-terminus
  of REV1  (Nelson et al. 1996, Hara et al. 2010, Kikuchi et al. 2012, Xie et al.

Instead, REV3L binding to MAD2L2 (REV7) during the formation of POLZ complex causes a conformational change in MAD2L2 that allows the C-terminal domain of MAD2L2 to bind the C-terminus of REV1  (Nelson et al. 1996, Hara et al. 2010, Kikuchi et al. 2012, Xie et al. 2012)
