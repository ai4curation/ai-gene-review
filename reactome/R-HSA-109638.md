display_name: Recruitment of RNA Polymerase II Holoenzyme by TFIIF to the pol II promoter:TFIID:TFIIA:TFIIB
  complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The general transcription factor TFIIF has a high affinity for the RNA Polymerase
  II holoenzyme.  TFIIF stabilizes the preinitiation complex, and suppresses non-specific
  binding of RNA Pol II to DNA, and is thus critical for start site recognition.
