species: Homo sapiens
summary: SQSTM1 binds to the KEAP1 subunit of the CRL3 ubiquitin ligase complex through
  the KEAP1 interacting region (KIR) located at residues 339-358 (Jain et al, 2010).
  Like NFE2L2, SQSTM1 has a KELCH1-domain binding STGE motif that is thought to interact
  with the KEAP1 complex in the 'open' conformation. Binding is enhanced by phosphorylation
  of the SQSTM1 STGE motif (Ichimura et al, 2013; reviewed in Baird and Yamamoto,
  2020).<br>SQSTM1 is a transcriptional target of NFE2L2 and is upregulated in the
  presence of cellular stressors like reactive oxygen species (ROS) and electrophiles
  (reviewed in Baird and Yamamoto, 2020). Upregulation of SQSTM1 under stress conditions
  leads to competition between NFE2L2 and SQSTM1 for KEAP1 binding and results in
  stabilization of NFE2L2 protein levels. This establishes a positive feedback loop
  as NFE2L2 is able to translocate into the nucleus to promote expression of its target
  genes (Jain et al, 2010).<br>SQSTM1 has also been shown to be a substrate for KEAP1:CUL3:RBX1-mediated
  ubiquitination. Ubiquitination at lysine 420 increases the ability of SQSTM1 to
  sequester and degrade target ubiquitinated proteins through selective autophagy
  (Lee et al, 2017). Some evidence shows that in addition to competing with NFE2L2
  for KEAP1-binding, SQSTM1 also targets KEAP1 for sequestration and degradation through
  the autophagy pathway (Copple et al, 2010; reviewed in Jiang et al, 2015). Sestrin
  proteins may also play a role in targeting KEAP1 for SQSTM1-dependent autophagy
  (Bae et al, 2013; Ro et al, 2014).
