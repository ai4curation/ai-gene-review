display_name: Dissociation of PERK:BiP Heterodimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PERK (EIF2AK3) is a single-pass transmembrane protein located in the Endoplasmic
  Reticulum (ER) membrane. PERK has an N-terminal luminal domain and a C-terminal
  cytosolic domain. It is maintained in an inactive state by association of its luminal
  domain with BiP, a chaperone in the ER. Because BiP also binds unfolded proteins,
  BiP dissociates from PERK when unfolded proteins exceed chaperone activity in the
  ER.
