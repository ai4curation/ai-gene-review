## Summary

Alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1(30-653)) binds G domain-like sequences in other extracellular matrix molecules such as AGRN (agrin) (Gee et al. 1993; Campanelli et al. 1994; Sugiyama et al. 1994; Yamada et al. 1996; Gesemann et al. 1996) and HSPG2 (perlecan) (Peng et al. 1998; Talts et al. 1999).

HSPG2 is a modular proteoglycan primarily located in the basement membrane of vascularized tissues.
