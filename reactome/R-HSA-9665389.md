display_name: Heterodimers of ERBB2 ECD mutants and EGFR trans-autophosphorylate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ERBB2 S310F shows stronger activation of downstream signaling than ERBB2
  G309A and ERBB2 G309E, and is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues in the C-tail
  (Greulich et al. 2012), while the C-tail phosphorylation of ERBB2 G309A (Bose et
  al. 2013) and ERBB2 G309E (Greulich et al. 2012) is comparable to the wild type
  ERBB2. Phosphorylation of EGFR was demonstrated in the presence of ERBB2 G309A (Bose
  et al. 2013). Except for ERBB2 C-tail tyrosine residues Y1221 and Y1222, which were
  shown to undergo trans-autophosphorylation in ERBB2 G309E, ERBB2 S310F and ERBB2
  S310Y (Greulich et al. 2012), phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in ERBB2
  and EGFR has not been examined and they are assumed to be the same as in the wild
  type ERBB2 heterodimers with EGFR.
