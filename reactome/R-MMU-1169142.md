stable_id: R-MMU-1169142
display_name: Jak2 binds Stat1/Stat3
species: Mus musculus
summary: 'JAK2 is believed to bind STAT1 and STAT3 directly in response to GH, as
  opposed to STAT5 which binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the distal portion
  of the GHR cytoplasmic region (Smit et al. 1996). When associated with the prolactin
  receptor JAK2 is able to bind STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 (DaSilva et al. 1996).


  Smit et al. identified mouse GHR residues Y341 (human Y332) and Y346 (not conserved
  in human) as required for STAT1, 3, and maximal STAT5 activation.'
