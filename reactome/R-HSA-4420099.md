display_name: 'p-6Y-VEGFR2 binds SHB '
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The adaptor protein SHB (Src homology 2 domain-containing adapter protein
  B) binds to phosphorylated tyrosine Y1175 in VEGFR2 and regulates the PTK2/FAK activity
  and endothelial cell migration. The SH2 domain located in the C-terminus of SHB
  interacts with the phosphotyrosine residue in VEGFR2 (Holmqvist et al. 2004). SHB
  is not required for vascular development, but SHB-deficient mice shows diffects
  in vessel functionality (Christoffersson et al. 2012) and impaired tumor growth
  (Funa et al. 2009).
