stable_id: R-HSA-4086059
display_name: SUMOylation of NPM1 with SUMO2,3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NPM1 (Nucleophosmin, B23) is SUMOylated at lysine-263 with SUMO2,3 (Liu et
  al. 2007, Blomster et al. 2009, Hendriks et al. 2014). SUMOylation enhances binding
  of NPM1 to Rb and enhances nuclear residency of NPM1.
