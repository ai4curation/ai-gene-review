**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

Several ubiquitin proteases deubiquitinate polyubiquitinated PTEN. USP13 and OTUD3 prolong the half-life of PTEN by preventing its proteasome-mediated degradation. Loss of USP13 or OTUD3 expression promotes AKT activation and cancer aggressiveness (Zhang et al. 2013, Yuan et al. 2015).
