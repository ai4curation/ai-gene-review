stable_id: R-HSA-9712087
display_name: ALK fusions phosphorylate FRS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FRS proteins are phosphorylated downstream of ALK fusions in a manner that
  depends on ALK kinase activity (Chikamori et al, 2007). FRS binding and activation
  contributes to the transformation activity of NPM-ALK, possibly by stimulating MAP
  kinase or PI3K signaling, consistent with established roles in other pathways (reviewed
  in Palmer et al, 2009; Gotoh, 2008; Sato and Gotoh, 2010).
