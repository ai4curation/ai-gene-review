display_name: Defective DPM1 does not transfer mannose to DOLP to form DOLPman
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase (DPM), a heterotrimeric protein embedded
  in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, mediates the transfer of mannose (from cytosolic
  GDP-mannose) to dolichyl phosphate (DOLP), to form dolichyl-phosphate-mannose (DOLPman).
  The first subunit of the heterotrimer (DPM1) appears to be the actual catalyst,
  and the other two subunits (DPM2 and 3) appear to stabilise it (Maeda et al. 2000).
  Defects in DPM1 can cause congenital disorder of glycosylation 1e (DPM1-CDG, CDG-1e;
  MIM:608799), a multisystem disorder caused by a defect in glycoprotein biosynthesis
  and characterised by under-glycosylated serum glycoproteins (Kim et al. 2000, Imbach
  et al. 2000, Garcia-Silva et al. 2004). Frameshift mutations that can cause DPM1-CDG
  are G111Lfs*45, Q210Rfs*4 as well as the point mutation R92G (Kim et al. 2000, Imbach
  et al. 2000).

## Summary

Dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase (DPM), a heterotrimeric protein embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, mediates the transfer of mannose (from cytosolic GDP-mannose) to dolichyl phosphate (DOLP), to form dolichyl-phosphate-mannose (DOLPman). The first subunit of the heterotrimer (DPM1) appears to be the actual catalyst, and the other two subunits (DPM2 and 3) appear to stabilise it (Maeda et al. 2000). Defects in DPM1 can cause congenital disorder of glycosylation 1e (DPM1-CDG, CDG-1e; MIM:608799), a multisystem disorder caused by a defect in glycoprotein biosynthesis and characterised by under-glycosylated serum glycoproteins (Kim et al. 2000, Imbach et al. 2000, Garcia-Silva et al. 2004). Frameshift mutations that can cause DPM1-CDG are G111Lfs*45, Q210Rfs*4 as well as the point mutation R92G (Kim et al. 2000, Imbach et al. 2000).
