display_name: NR3C2 binds fludrocortisone
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid used in conjunction with
  hydrocortisone to replace missing endogenous corticosteroids in patients with adrenal
  insufficiency. It is functionally similar to aldosterone, the body's primary endogenous
  mineralocorticoid, and is structurally analogous to cortisol, differing only by
  a fluorine atom at the 9-position of the steroid structure and having similar affinity
  for the mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2) as aldosterone (Rupprecht et al. 1993,
  Oelkers et al. 1994).<br><br>Fludrocortisone is indicated as partial replacement
  therapy for primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency in Addison's disease
  and for the treatment of salt-losing androgenital syndrome (Charmandari et al. 2014,
  Hamitouche et al. 2017). Fludrocortisone has also shown to be effective in the treatment
  of cerebral salt-wasting syndrome (Taplin et al. 2006, Misra et al. 2018). Common
  side effects of fludrocortisone include high blood pressure, swelling, heart failure,
  and low blood potassium.
