display_name: PTK6 phosphorylates BCAR1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated PTK6 (BRK) phosphorylates BCAR1 (p130CAS) on tyrosine residues
  Y165 and Y664, and possibly other tyrosine residues. PTK6-mediated phosphorylation
  of BCAR1 contributes to formation of peripheral focal adhesion complexes involved
  in cell migration. Integrin receptors, growth factor receptors and ERK5 (MAPK7)
  contribute to PTK6-mediated formation of peripheral adhesion complexes (Zheng et
  al. 2012). PTK6-mediated phosphorylation of BCAR1 can also be triggered by UV-induced
  DNA damage and associated signaling (Chastkofsky et al. 2015).
