stable_id: R-MMU-573376
display_name: NoRC:intergenic spacer:Hdac:Dnmt complex deacetylates histone H4 and
  dimethylates lysine-9 of histone H3 in main promoter of the rRNA gene
species: Mus musculus
summary: Histones in silenced rRNA gene copies are deacetylated by Hdac1 (and possibly
  Hdac2), which is part of the SIN3-HDAC complex bound to NoRC (Santoro et al. 2002,
  Zhou et al. 2002). The PHD domain of the Tip5 (Baz2a) component of NoRC binds acetylated
  lysine-16 of histone H4 (Zhou and Grummt 2005). The residues of histone H4 that
  are deacetylatd are lysine-5, lysine-8, and lysine-12 (Zhou and Grummt 2005).<br>In
  the main promoters of silenced rRNA gene copies, histone H3 is methylated on lysine-9
  (H3K9) by an unknown histone methyltransferase (Santoro and Grummt 2005). H3K9 methylation
  is still observed when deacetylation is inhibited, therefore histone methylation
  does not depend on deacetylation (Santoro and Grummt 2005). However, histone deacetylation
  is required for DNA methylation. Significantly more H3K9 dimethylation than trimethylation
  is observed (Santoro and Grummt 2005).<br>It is unknown if deacetylation precedes
  methylation or vice versa.
