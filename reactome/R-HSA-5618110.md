display_name: p23 (PTGES3) binds HSP90:ATP:FKBP4:nascent protein
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Immunophilin p23 (also known as PTGES3) binds selectively to the ATP-bound
  state of HSP90. p23 stabilizes the closed state of HSP90, which weakens the binding
  of STIP1(HOP) and promotes its exit from the complex (McLaughlin H et al. 2006;
  Karagöz GE et al. 2011). When p23 is added to the client-transfer complex in the
  absence of the immunophilin or with FKBP51 (FKBP5), two copies of p23 are incorporated
  with concomitant loss of HSP70 and HOP (Ebong I et al. 2016). By contrast no stable
  complex with two p23 subunits is observed in the presence of FKBP52 (FKBP4); expulsion
  of HSP70, HOP and p23 occur with a low population of a complex incorporating only
  one p23 subunit (Ebong I et al. 2016).
