display_name: USP18 deubiquitinates TAK1:TAB1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Ubiquitination plays a key role in the regulation of signaling via TAK1 (Chen
  2012). USP18 catalyzes the deubiquitination of the TAK1:TAB1 complex, reversing
  TAK1 activating ubiquitination, which restricts activation of NF-kappaB, NFAT and
  JNK and in decreases the expression of IL2 in T cells after TCR activation (Liu
  et al. 2013).
