summary: 'Grb2 bound to tyrosine phosphorylated FRS2 forms a ternary complex with
  Cbl through the binding of the SH3 domains of Grb2 to a proline rich region in Cbl.
  Grb2-mediated recruitment of Cbl results in ubiquitination of FGFR and FRS2. Cbl
  is a multidomain protein that posses an intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity and
  also functions as a platform for recruitment of a variety of signaling proteins.
  Multiple mechanisms appear to be required for downregulation of FGFR, as internalization
  of the receptor is reduced but not abolished if recruitment of CBL to FRS2 is compromised
  by mutation of GRB2-binding sites.  '

## Summary

Grb2 bound to tyrosine phosphorylated FRS2 forms a ternary complex with Cbl through the binding of the SH3 domains of Grb2 to a proline rich region in Cbl. Grb2-mediated recruitment of Cbl results in ubiquitination of FGFR and FRS2. Cbl is a multidomain protein that posses an intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity and also functions as a platform for recruitment of a variety of signaling proteins. Multiple mechanisms appear to be required for downregulation of FGFR, as internalization of the receptor is reduced but not abolished if recruitment of CBL to FRS2 is compromised by mutation of GRB2-binding sites.
