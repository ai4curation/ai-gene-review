display_name: BH2 binding can lead to eNOS uncoupling
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The oxidation product of BH4, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), can compete with
  BH4 for binding to eNOS. This can lead to the uncoupling of eNOS and can result
  in the formation of reactive oxygen species (Vasquez-Vivar et al. 2002).

## Summary

The oxidation product of BH4, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), can compete with BH4 for binding to eNOS. This can lead to the uncoupling of eNOS and can result in the formation of reactive oxygen species (Vasquez-Vivar et al. 2002).
