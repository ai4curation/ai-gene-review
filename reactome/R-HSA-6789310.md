display_name: LIPs hydrolyse TG to DAG and RCOOH
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Lipases are enzymes that hydrolyse dietary lipids such as fats, oils and
  triglycerides. The majority of human lipases are secreted by the pancreas and function
  mainly in the digestive system. Lipase members K, M and N (LIPK, M and N), however,
  all appear to play a role in the last step of keratinocyte differentiation where
  they are proposed to hydrolyse triglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol which
  is essential to stratum corneum hydration (Toulza et al. 2007).
