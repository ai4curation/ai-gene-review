display_name: Formation of neuronal progenitor BAF (npBAF)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Studies in mice identified a neural progenitor (np) BAF complex that is required
  for the proliferation of neural stem and progenitor cells (Lessard et al, 2007;
  Staahl et al, 2013). These complexes differ slightly from esBAF complexes in subunit
  composition. npBAF complexes contain either SMARCA4 or SMARCA2 as catalytic subunits,
  may contain either ARID1A or ARID1B, and contain SMARCD1 and SMARCD3 but not SMARCD2
  (Lessard et al, 2007; Stahl et al, 2013; reviewed in Staahl and Crabtree, 2013;
