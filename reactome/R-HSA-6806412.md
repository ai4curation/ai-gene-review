stable_id: R-HSA-6806412
display_name: TP53 and AP-1 bind the MSH2 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TP53 (p53) binds to the p53 response element in the promoter of the MSH2
  gene. The p53 response element is flanked by two AP-1 sites. The AP-1 transcription
  factor complex binds the MSH2 promoter cooperatively with TP53 (Scherer et al. 2000).
  An additional p53 response element in closer proximity to the MSH2 transcription
  start site has been reported that does not involve a nearby AP-1 binding site (Warnick
  et al. 2001).
