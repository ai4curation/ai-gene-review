species: Homo sapiens
summary: Regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity is implicated in the
  control of almost all cellular functions. One of the best understood RTKs is epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR). Growth factors can bind to EGFR and activate it to
  initiate signalling cascades within the cell. EGFRs can also be recruited to clathrin-coated
  pits which can be internalised into endocytic vesicles. From here, EGFRs can either
  be recycled back to the plasma membrane or directed to lysosomes for destruction.This
  provides a mechanism by which EGFR signalling is negatively regulated and controls
  the strength and duration of EGFR-induced signals. It also prevents EGFR hyperactivation
  as commonly seen in tumorigenesis.<br><br>The proto-oncogene Cbl can negatively
  regulate EGFR signalling. The Cbl family of RING-type ubiquitin ligases are able
  to poly-ubiquitinate EGFR, an essential step in EGFR degradation. All Cbl proteins
  have a unique domain that recognises phosphorylated tyrosine residues on activated
  EGFRs. They also direct the ubiquitination and degradation of activated EGFRs by
  recruiting ubiquitin-conjugation enzymes. Cbl proteins function by specifically
  targeting activated EGFRs and mediating their down-regulation, thus providing a
  means by which signaling processes can be negatively regulated.<br><br>Cbl also
  promotes receptor internalization via it's interaction with an adaptor protein,
  CIN85 (Cbl-interacting protein of 85kDa). CIN85 binds to Cbl via it's SH3 domain
  and is enhanced by the EGFR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. The proline-rich
  region of CIN85 interacts with endophilins which are regulatory components of clathrin-coated
  vesicles (CCVs). Endophilins bind to membranes and induce membrane curvature, in
  conjunction with other proteins involved in CCV formation. The rapid recruitment
  of endophilin to the activated receptor complex by CIN85 is the mechanism which
  controls receptor internalization.
