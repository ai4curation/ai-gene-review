display_name: Recruitment of PLCgamma to membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PLCgamma (PLCG) is recruited to FCGR and the phosphorylated Y342 and Y346
  in SYK have been reported to be involved in the interaction of PLCG (Law et al.
  1996). PLCG accumulates at the phagocytic cup during FCGR, but the exact role of
  PLCG in the regulation of phagocytosis is not clear. It may be involved in FCGR
  signaling by activating PKC through DAG production (Garcia-Garcia & Rosales 2002
