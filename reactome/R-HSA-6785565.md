species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Human beta-1,3-glucosyltransferase-like protein (B3GALTL, HGNC Approved
  Gene Symbol: B3GLCT; MIM:610308; CAZy family GT31), localised on the ER membrane,
  glucosylates O-fucosylated proteins. The resultant glc-beta-1,3-fuc disaccharide
  modification on thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR1) domain-containing proteins is
  thought to assist in the secretion of many of these proteins from the ER lumen,
  and mediate an ER quality-control mechanism of folded TSRs (Vasudevan et al. 2015).
  Defects in B3GALTL can cause Peters plus syndrome (PpS; MIM:261540), an autosomal
  recessive disorder characterised by anterior eye chamber defects, short stature,
  delay in growth and mental developmental and cleft lip and/or palate (Heinonen &
  Maki 2009). More than 10 mutations in B3GALTL causing PsP are known (Weh et al.
  2014) including the missense mutation G393E (Dassie Ajdid et al. 2009).'

## Summary

Human beta-1,3-glucosyltransferase-like protein (B3GALTL, HGNC Approved Gene Symbol: B3GLCT; MIM:610308; CAZy family GT31), localised on the ER membrane, glucosylates O-fucosylated proteins.

Defects in B3GALTL can cause Peters plus syndrome (PpS; MIM:261540), an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by anterior eye chamber defects, short stature, delay in growth and mental developmental and cleft lip and/or palate (Heinonen & Maki 2009).
