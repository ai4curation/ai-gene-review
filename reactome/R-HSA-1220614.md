display_name: Spontaneous dimerization of ligand-responsive EGFR mutants
species: Homo sapiens
summary: EGFR ligand-responsive mutants dimerize spontaneously, without ligand binding,
  although ligand binding ability is preserved. This was experimentally demonstrated
  for EFGR L858R mutant and is presumed to happen in other constitutively active EGFR
  kinase domain mutants and EGFR extracellular domain point mutants.

## Summary

EGFR ligand-responsive mutants dimerize spontaneously, without ligand binding, although ligand binding ability is preserved. This was experimentally demonstrated for EFGR L858R mutant and is presumed to happen in other constitutively active EGFR kinase domain mutants and EGFR extracellular domain point mutants.
