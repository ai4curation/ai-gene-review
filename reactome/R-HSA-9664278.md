display_name: Phosphorylation and activation of PLCG due to FCGR3A effect
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PLCG is tyrosine phosphorylated by either SYK or Src kinases on three tyrosine
  residues and this phosphorylation enhances the activity of PLCG. Although maximal
  activation requires binding of PLCG to PIP3 with its plecstrin homology (PH) domain.
