display_name: SBH1:GET3:ATP:GET4:MDY2:SGT2 dissociates and GET3 hydrolyzes ATP yielding
  SBH1:GET3:ADP
species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
summary: A tail-anchored protein such as SBH1 (Sec61beta) is transferred from SGT2
  to a GET3:ATP dimer via the GET4:MDY2 (GET4:GET5) complex (Chartron et al. 2010,
  Gristick et al. 2014, Gristick et al. 2015, Mateja et al. 2015). After transfer
  the SBH1:GET3:ATP complex dissociates from GET4:MDY2 and ATP is hydrolyzed by the
  GET3 dimer (Gristick et al. 2014, Chio et al. 2017), resulting in a change in conformation
  and a change in affinity for other molecules in the insertion pathway (Rome et al.
  2014, Chio et al. 2017). The timing of the hydrolysis of ATP is uncertain. GET4:MDY2
  inhbits ATP hydrolysis by GET3 so ATP hydrolysis may occur after GET3:ATP has dissociated
  from GET4:MDY2 (Rome et al. 2013, Gristick et al. 2014).

## Summary

A tail-anchored protein such as SBH1 (Sec61beta) is transferred from SGT2 to a GET3:ATP dimer via the GET4:MDY2 (GET4:GET5) complex (Chartron et al. 2010, Gristick et al. 2014, Gristick et al. 2015, Mateja et al. 2015). After transfer the SBH1:GET3:ATP complex dissociates from GET4:MDY2 and ATP is hydrolyzed by the GET3 dimer (Gristick et al. 2014, Chio et al. 2017), resulting in a change in conformation and a change in affinity for other molecules in the insertion pathway (Rome et al. 2014, Chio et al. 2017). The timing of the hydrolysis of ATP is uncertain. GET4:MDY2 inhbits ATP hydrolysis by GET3 so ATP hydrolysis may occur after GET3:ATP has dissociated from GET4:MDY2 (Rome et al. 2013, Gristick et al. 2014).
