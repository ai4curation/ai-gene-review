display_name: Glycosphingolipid catabolism
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Gangliosides (GGs) are glycosphingolipids in which oligosaccharide chains
  containing N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc) are attached to a ceramide. Produced
  in the Golgi, they locate to the plasma membrane, where they contribute to Ca2+
  and protein-ligand binding and to the ability of patches of the membrane to experience
  high curvature topologies, which is essential in many neuronal cells. Degradation
  of complex polysialylgangliosides starts during endocytosis producing GM1. Inward
  budding of the late endosomal membrane yields intralysosomal luminal vesicles (ILV)
  that carry the GGs on the outside of their membranes for final degradation and release
  to the cytosol. Essential cofactors for lysosomal ganglioside catabolism are the
  saposins, small carrier proteins which make GGs soluble by providing lipid anchors
  to move GGs from ILV membranes to the lysosome lumen. Another cofactor is the Ganglioside
  GM2 activator (GM2A, GM2AP), which is essential for beta-hexosaminidase activity
  in the degradation of GM2, GA2, and SM2A. Further cofactors appear to be membrane
  lipids including cholesterol. Lack of any participating enzyme or cofactor leads
  to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in lysosomes and sphingolipidoses, including
  Gaucher's and Niemann–Pick diseases (reviewed in Kolter & Sandhoff, 2010; Sandhoff,
  2016; Sandhoff & Sandhoff, 2018; Sandhoff et al., 2018; Breiden & Sandhoff, 2020).
