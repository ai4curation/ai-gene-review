display_name: STAT3 is phosphorylated by TSLP:IL7R:CRLF2:STAT3 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Inferred from mouse:<br>Following binding of TSLP to Cytokine receptor-like
  factor 2 (CRLF2, TSLPR) and Interleukin-7 receptor subunit alpha (IL7R), Signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 5A and 5B (STAT5A and STAT5B) and Signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were phosphorylated in various
  Ba/F3 cell populations (Reche et al. 2001).<br>This is a black box event since the
  kinase responsible for STAT phosphorylation is unknown.
