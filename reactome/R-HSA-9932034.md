stable_id: R-HSA-9932034
display_name: CsgA binds the fibronectin matrix
species: Homo sapiens
summary: E.coli curlin subunit CsgA binds to fibronectin. Curli consist of proteinaceous
  adhesive filaments that form a coil-like structure on the surface of E.coli, necessary
  for biofilm formation on host cells and fomites (Olsén et al., 1993; Dorel et al.,
  1999; Cegelski et al., 2009; reviewed by Laverty et al., 2014).
