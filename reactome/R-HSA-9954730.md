display_name: PELO:HBS1L-1:GTP binds 80S ribosome:non-stop mRNA:peptidyl-tRNA with
  nascent peptide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The PELO:HBS1L:GTP (Pelota:HBS1:GTP) complex binds a ribosome that is stalled
  at the 3' end of a mRNA (Shao et al. 2013, and inferred from human PELO:HBS1L and
  rabbit ribosomes in Pisareva et al. 2011, inferred from yeast homologs DOM34:HBS1
  in Shoemaker et al. 2010, Tsuboi et al. 2012, Guydosh and Green 2014, reviewed in
  Franckenberg et al. 2012). PELO is a paralog of the ribosome release factor eRF1
  and HBS1L is a paralog of the ribosome release factor eRF3, which binds and hydrolyzes
  GTP (reviewed in Franckenberg et al. 2012).
