display_name: LRP1:Hemopexin:heme is endocytosed
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The LRP1:hemopexin:heme complex is endocytosed and the complex is dissociated
  in lysosomes, leading to heme uptake. Heme is then degraded by heme oxygenases.
  Whereas LRP1 is subsequently recycled to the plasma membrane, the destiny of hemopexin
  is controversial. Some studies have suggested that hemopexin can be recycled as
  an intact molecule to the extracellular milieu (Smith and Morgan, 1979). However,
  it has also been proposed that following hepatic uptake of heme from hemopexin:heme,
  varying proportions of the protein are either returned to the circulation or degraded
  in the liver (Potter et al., 1993). Recently, Hvidberg et al. have shown that most
  hemopexin is degraded in lysosomes (Hvidberg et al., 2005).
