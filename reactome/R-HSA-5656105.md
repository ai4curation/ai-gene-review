display_name: POLI simultaneously binds REV1 and monoUb:K164-PCNA at damaged DNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'DNA polymerase iota (POLI) is recruited to DNA damage sites through its
  interaction with PCNA and REV1. POLI has a functional PIP box in the C-terminus
  and two ubiquitin binding motifs (UBMs). The PIP box and UBMs are responsible for
  POLI binding to monoubiquitinated PCNA (MonoUb:K164-PCNA) (Bienko et al. 2005, Haracska
  et al. 2005, Bomar et al. 2010). The interaction between POLI and the C-terminus
  of REV1 is evolutionarily conserved (Kosarek et al. 2003, Guo et al. 2003, Ohashi
  et al. 2004). Since REV1 and POLI likely cooperate in the bypass of bulky DNA lesions
  (Yang et al. 2003) and the DNA polymerase zeta complex (POLZ) is needed for extension
  of nucleotides incorporated by POLI (Johnson et al. 2000), it is plausible that
  POLI forms a quaternary complex with REV1 and POLZ, as shown for POLK and proposed
  for other Y family DNA polymerases (Xie et al. 2012). '

## Summary

DNA polymerase iota (POLI) is recruited to DNA damage sites through its interaction with PCNA and REV1. POLI has a functional PIP box in the C-terminus and two ubiquitin binding motifs (UBMs). The PIP box and UBMs are responsible for POLI binding to monoubiquitinated PCNA (MonoUb:K164-PCNA) (Bienko et al. 2005, Haracska et al. 2005, Bomar et al. 2010). The interaction between POLI and the C-terminus of REV1 is evolutionarily conserved (Kosarek et al. 2003, Guo et al. 2003, Ohashi et al. 2004). Since REV1 and POLI likely cooperate in the bypass of bulky DNA lesions (Yang et al. 2003) and the DNA polymerase zeta complex (POLZ) is needed for extension of nucleotides incorporated by POLI (Johnson et al. 2000), it is plausible that POLI forms a quaternary complex with REV1 and POLZ, as shown for POLK and proposed for other Y family DNA polymerases (Xie et al. 2012).
