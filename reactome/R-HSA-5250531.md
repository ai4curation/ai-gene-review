display_name: ARV1 transports CHOL from ER membrane to plasma membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Sterols such as cholesterol (CHOL) synthesised in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) need to be efficiently transported to the plasma membrane, where 90% of the
  free sterol pool resides. Conversely, sterols taken up from outside the cell need
  to be transported back to the ER for esterification to sterol esters. The mechanisms
  that control this bi-directional movement of sterols are still poorly understood
  but a likely candidate is protein ARV1 (ARV1). Studies with mutant yeast Arv1 indicate
  altered intracellular sterol distribution and subsequent defects in sphingolipid
  metabolism. Human ARV1, a predicted sequence ortholog of yeast Arv1, complements
  the defects seen associated with deletion of yeast Arv1 (Tinkelenberg et al. 2000,
  Swain et al. 2002).
