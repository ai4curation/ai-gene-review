stable_id: R-HSA-6788556
display_name: NUBPL transfers 4Fe-4S to NDUFV1, V2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In total, eight iron-sulfur (4Fe-4S) clusters are incorporated into six subunits
  (mitochondrial matrix-located NDUFS1, S2, S7, S8 and mitochondrial membrane-located
  V1 and V2) (Andrews et al. 2013). Incorporation into NDUFS1, S2, S7 and S8 is shown
  in a separate reaction. The process requires the presence of the co-chaperone complex
  HSPA9:HSCB (Maio et al., 2017). The mechanism of transfer is unknown. NDUFV1 also
  binds FMN (Schuelke et al. 1998).
