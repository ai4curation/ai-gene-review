summary: Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2 (JAK2) or Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK3 (JAK3)
  are phosphorylated after the binding of Interleukin-20 (IL20) to a heterodimeric
  receptor complex formed by Interleukin-20 receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA) associated
  with Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and Interleukin-20 receptor subunit beta
  (IL20RB).<br>JAK2 is phosphorylated at Tyr-1007/1008 (Tritsaris et al. 2007). JAK3
  is also phosphorylated (Lee et al. 2012).<br>This is a black box event because it
  is unclear whether JAK2 and JAK3 are phosphorylated simultaneously or sequentially
  during IL20 stimulation.
