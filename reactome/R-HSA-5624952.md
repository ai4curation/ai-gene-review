display_name: Assembly of the retrograde IFT train
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Remodelling of IFT trains is thought to occur at the ciliary tip (Iomini
  et al, 2001; Buisson et al, 2013; reviewed in Snell and Cole, 2009). Retrograde
  transport is driven by the multi-subunit dynein-2 motor in an ATP-dependent fashion
  (Hou et al, 2004; Pazour et al, 1999; Porter et al, 1999; reviewed in Cole and Snell,
  2009; Ishikawa et al, 2011). Mutations in genes encoding members of the IFT A complex
  or the dynein-2 motor generally result in short, swollen cilia that abnormally accumulate
  IFT components (Iomini et al, 2009; Piperno et al, 1998; Pazour et al, 1999). The
  subunit composition of the human dynein-2 complex has recently been analyzed and
  preliminary characterization of the IFT A complex has begun, but detailed understanding
  of the molecular architecture of the retrograde IFT trains is still lacking (Assante
  et al, 2014; Piperno et al, 1998; Mukhopadhyay et al, 2010; reviewed in Taschner
  et al, 2012).
