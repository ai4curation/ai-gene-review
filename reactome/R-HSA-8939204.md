summary: 'In the nucleus, estrogens bind to estrogen receptors, members of the nuclear

  in the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the urogenital tract and
  in the breast and bone; ER alpha expression predominates in the uterus, mammary
  gland, and liver, and the gastrointestinal tract expresses only ER beta (Pearce
  and Jordan, 2004; Gustafsson et al, 1999; Pfaffl et al, 2001; reviewed in Bai and
  Gust, 2009).  The receptors show 47% identity overall and share a common organization
  consisting of 6 domains: an N-terminal A/B domain with ligand-independent activation
  function, a C domain containing the 2 DNA-binding zinc fingers, a hinge region (D)
  with a nuclear localization signal, an E domain that contains the ligand binding
  and dimerization domains as well as a ligand-dependent transactivation function,
  and a C-terminal F domain of poorly characterized function. The DNA-binding domain
  is the most highly conserved (97% identity) while the ligand-bindind domain is more
  variable (47% identity) (reviewed in Ruff et al, 2000; Bai and Gust, 2009). ER alpha
  and beta can homo- and heterodimerize, and recognize a common estrogen-response
  element due to their shared DNA-binding domains (reviewed in Bai and Gust, 2009).

## Summary

In the nucleus, estrogens bind to estrogen receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Human cells have 2 estrogen receptors, ER alpha and ER beta, encoded by two genes. Expression of the two genes varies by tissue: both are expressed in the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the urogenital tract and in the breast and bone; ER alpha expression predominates in the uterus, mammary gland, and liver, and the gastrointestinal tract expresses only ER beta (Pearce and Jordan, 2004; Gustafsson et al, 1999; Pfaffl et al, 2001; reviewed in Bai and Gust, 2009).
