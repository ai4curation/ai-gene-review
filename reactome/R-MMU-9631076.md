display_name: Hspa8:substrate binds late endosomal phospholipids
species: Mus musculus
summary: Microautophagy (MI) can target KFERQ motif containing protein substrates
  to endosomal degradation. Upon binding with Hspa8, substrates are transported from
  the cytosol to late endosomes. Here, Hspa8 binds with the phospholipids on the late
  endosomal membrane. This interaction facilitates the vesicle-mediated transport
  of Hspa8:substrate complex into the late endosomes for degradation (Sahu R et al.
  2011).
