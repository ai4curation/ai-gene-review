display_name: Dissociation of AAK1 and dephosphorylation of AP-2 mu2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GAPVD1 binds the alpha adaptin ear domain of AP-2 mu2, activating its RAB5-directed
  GEF activity and displacing AAK1.  AAK1 displacement results in a net dephosphorylation
  of the AP-2 mu2 subunit, destabilizing the interaction of AP-2 with the vesicle
  membrane (Sato et al, 2005; Smerdjieva et al, 2008). In addition, RAB5 contributes
  to PI(4,5)P2 turnover through recruitment of a PI3K or PI phosphatase, and this
  also destabilizes the interaction of AP-2 with the membrane (Smerdjieva et al, 2008;
  Christoforidis et al, 1999; Shin et al, 2005).
