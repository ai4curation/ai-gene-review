display_name: Release of PLCG from FCGR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated PLCG translocates to the plasmamembrane and interacts with the
  inositol ring of the membrane bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  with its PH domain. The active enzyme promotes intracelllular signaling by catalysing
  the hydrolysis of PIP2 to generate the second messengers IP3 and DAG.

## Summary

Activated PLCG translocates to the plasmamembrane and interacts with the inositol ring of the membrane bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) with its PH domain. The active enzyme promotes intracelllular signaling by catalysing the hydrolysis of PIP2 to generate the second messengers IP3 and DAG.
