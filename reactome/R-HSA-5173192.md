display_name: POFUT2 transfers fucose to TSR domain-containing proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The O-fucosylation of proteins containing thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR1)
  domains is carried out by protein fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2). Only POFUT2 recognises
  the consensus sequence CSXS/TCG found in TSR1 domains and the fucosyl residue is
  attached to the hydroxyl group of conserved serine (S) or threonine (T) residues  within
  the consensus sequence (Chen et al. 2012). The modification was first demonstrated
  on thrombospondin 1 (THBS1, TSP1), found in platelets and the ECM (Hofsteenge et
  al. 2001, Luo et al. 2006). In humans, there are more than 60 of these TSR1 domain-containing
  proteins. Only the proteins with similarity to experimentally confirmed ones are
  listed as candidates.
