stable_id: R-HSA-158354
display_name: kininogen + C1q binding protein tetramer -> kininogen:C1q binding protein
  tetramer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Kininogen (high molecular weight kininogen; HK) associates with C1q binding
  protein on the cell surface in a reaction dependent on Zn++ (Joseph et al. 1996).
  In the body, the Zn++  needed to drive this reaction may be provided locally by
  Zn++ release from activated platelets (Mahdi et al. 2002). The C1q binding protein
  is inferred to form tetramers based on the properties of purified recombinant protein
  in vitro (Ghebrehiwet et al. 1994); the stoichiometry of the cell surface complex
  has not been determined directly.
