summary: 'Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3(n-3)) is an omega-3 fatty acid, supplied
  through diet as it cannot be synthesized by humans. ALA has an important role in
  human health. It is converted to long chain more unsaturated n-3 fatty acids by
  a series of alternating desaturation and elongation reactions. Omega-3 products
  of ALA such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduce
  inflammation and may help lower risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease
  and arthritis. All the desaturation and elongation steps occur in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) except for the final step which requires translocation to peroxisomes
  for partial beta-oxidation.<br><br>The alpha-linolenic acid pathway involves the
  following steps: 18:3(n-3)--> 18:4(n-3)-->20:4(n-3)-->20:5(n-3)-->22:5(n-3)-->24:5(n-3)-->24:6(n-3)-->22:6(n-3).
  Two desaturation enzymes are involved in this process: delta-6 desaturase that converts
  18:3(n-3) to 18:4(n-3) and 24:5(n-3) to 24:6(n-3) respectively, delta-5 desaturase
  20:4(n-3) to 20:5(n-3). (Sprecher 2002).'
