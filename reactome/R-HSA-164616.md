summary: hTERC is transcribed as a precursor and is processed at its 3' end to yield
  a 451 nucleotide RNA (Zaug et al. 1996). The accumulation of hTERC that has undergone
  this processing event requires a conserved region of sequence termed the box H/ACA
  motif (Mitchell et al. 1999a). This motif is bound by a complex containing DKC1
  (dyskerin), and mutations in dyskerin affect the processing and accumulation of
  hTERC (Mitchell et al. 1999b; Mitchell and Collins 2000; Fu and Collins 2003). Studies
  of purified, catalytically active telomerase indicate that the minimal structure
  that has telomerase activity in vitro is a complex of one molecule of hTERC RNA,
  one molecule of hTERT and two molecules of DKC1 (dyskerin) (Cohen et al. 2007).
  A cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structure of human substrate-bound telomerase holoenzyme
  revealed that, in addition to one molecule of hTERC RNA, one molecule of hTERT and

  also known as telomere Cajal body protein 1) and two molecules of each NOP10, NHP2

  HeLa cells, and activities of these proteins are required for telomerase RNP assembly
