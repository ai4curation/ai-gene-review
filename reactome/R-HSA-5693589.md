stable_id: R-HSA-5693589
display_name: D-loop dissociation and strand annealing
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Following repair synthesis, the extended D-loop strands may disassociate
  from their sister chromatid complements and reanneal with their original complementary
  strands. A DNA helicase RTEL1 disrupts preformed D-loops and promotes synthesis-dependent
  strand annealing, yielding non-crossover products and preventing excessive recombination
  between mitotic sister chromatids (Barber et al. 2008, Uringa et al. 2012).

## Summary

Following repair synthesis, the extended D-loop strands may disassociate from their sister chromatid complements and reanneal with their original complementary strands. A DNA helicase RTEL1 disrupts preformed D-loops and promotes synthesis-dependent strand annealing, yielding non-crossover products and preventing excessive recombination between mitotic sister chromatids (Barber et al. 2008, Uringa et al. 2012).
