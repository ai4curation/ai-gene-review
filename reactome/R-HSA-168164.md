display_name: Toll Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) Cascade
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as was shown for mammals is expressed in various
  tissues and cells, including myeloid dendritic cells, macrophages, respiratory and
  intestinal epithelium, neurons and microglial cells to induce antiviral and inflammatory
  responses of the innate immunity in combating viral infections.<p>TLR3 recognizes
  dsRNA in the endosome and that triggers the receptor dimerization. TLR3 recruits
  the adaptor TRIF (TICAM1), leading to the activation of NF-kappa-B and the production
  of type I interferons (IFNs). dsRNA-stimulated phosphorylation of two specific TLR3
  tyrosine residues (Tyr759 and Tyr858) is essential for initiating TLR3 signaling
  pathways.
