stable_id: R-HSA-2022856
display_name: EXT1:EXT2 transfers GlcA to heparan
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The EXT1 subunit of the EXT1:EXT2 complex transfers a glucuronyl (GlcA) moiety
  from UDP-GlcA to the growing heparan chain of HSPGs. Exostosin 1 and 2 (EXT1 and
  2) are dual specificity enzymes which catalyze the addition of N-acetylglucosamine
  (GlcNAc) and glucuronate (GlcA) to the GAG protein linker sequence. The first addition
  mediated by the EXT1:EXT2 complex is that of glucuronate, after EXTL2,3 have added
  the first GlcNAc unit to the linkage sequence. EXT1 and 2 form a heterodimer which
  translocates to the Golgi apparatus from the ER membrane (McCormick et al. 2000).
  Defects in EXT1 or 2 cause the hereditary bone disorders multiple exostoses type
  1 (MIM:133700) and 2 (MIM:133701) (Wuyts et al. 1998, Bernard et al. 2001).
