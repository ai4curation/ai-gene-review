stable_id: R-HSA-4341072
display_name: SUMOylation of RARA with SUMO2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RARA (Retinoic acid receptor alpha) is SUMOylated at lysine-166, lysine-171,
  and lysine-399 with SUMO2 (Zhu et al. 2009). SUMOylation at lysine-166 and lysine-171
  is induced by all-trans retinoic acid and inhibits nuclear localization of RARA.
  SUMOylation at lysine-399 is observed in the absence of all-trans retinoic acid
  and enhances nuclear localization of RARA. SUMOylation of all 3 sites inhibits transcriptional
  activation by RARA.
