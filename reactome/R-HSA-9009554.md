stable_id: R-HSA-9009554
display_name: IL34 dimer:SDC1 binds CSF1R
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-34 (IL34) can bind Syndecan-1 (SDC1), a cell surface proteoglycan.
  Low levels of SDC1 may sequester IL34 at the cell surface and prevent it from binding
  Macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), while high SDC1 levels
  may facilitate IL34-CSF1R signaling (Segaliny et al. 2015). Ultimately, these events
  lead to the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines regulating the innate immunity
  and inflammation. The precise interaction between IL34:SDC1 and CSF1R is unknown.
  Hence, this interaction is represented as an uncertain black box event.
