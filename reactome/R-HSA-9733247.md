display_name: YBX1 binds COL1A2 gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The transcription factor YBX1 (also known as YB1), activated by ERK-mediated
  phosphorylation in response to interferon-gamma (IFNG) signaling, binds to SMAD3
  at the promoter of the collagen I gene COL1A2. YBX1 prevents recruitment of the
  histone acetyltransferase EP300 (p300) to the COL1A2 promoter and represses COL1A2
  transcription (Higashi, Iganaki, Suzuki et al. 2003; Higashi, Iganaki, Fujimori
  et al. 2003). YBX1 is thought to be the key mediator of the anti-fibrotic effect
  of IFNG signaling (Dooley et al. 2006).
