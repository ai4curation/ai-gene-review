stable_id: R-HSA-1912412
display_name: NOTCH1 mRNA translation controlled by miRNAs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Translation of NOTCH1 mRNA is negatively regulated by microRNAs miR-200B
  and miR200C (Kong et al. 2010), miR-34 (Li et al. 2009, Ji et al. 2009) and miR-449
  (Marcet et al. 2011). These miRNAs bind and cause degradation of NOTCH1 mRNA, resulting
  in decreased level of NOTCH1 protein product.
