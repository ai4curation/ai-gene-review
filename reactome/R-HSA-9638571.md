display_name: FimH binds D-mannose moiety on host cell
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FimH, as part of type I pili in pathogenic E.coli strains, binds terminally
  located D-mannose moieties on cell-bound glycoproteins like EPCAM or uroplakin 1a
  (UPK1A) (Wu et al. 1996, Zhou et al. 2001). This enables pathogenic E.coli to bind
  to a range of cells including erythrocytes, epithelial cells, granulocytes, macrophages
  and mast cells (Krogfelt et al., 1990; Connell et al., 1996; Sauer et al., 2016).
  D-Mannose supplementation has been shown to improve urinary tract infection (UTI)
  symptoms, presumably by overwhelming the binding capacity of FimH (reviewed e.g.
  in De Nunzio et al., 2021).
