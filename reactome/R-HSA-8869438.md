display_name: Dissociation of clathrin-associated proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After the removal of the clathrin coat, it is likely that many of the proteins
  that contributed to vesicle formation are lost, although the timing and mechanism
  of this step are poorly understood (reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Lemmon,
  2001).
