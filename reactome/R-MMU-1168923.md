stable_id: R-MMU-1168923
display_name: Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation
species: Mus musculus
summary: Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in response to GH in CHO cells expressing
  mouse GHR forms capable of binding JAK2 (Smit et al. 1996). Similar results were
  obtained using the porcine receptor (Wang et al. 1996). Thus Jak2 phosphorylates
  Stat5, the phosphorylated monomers form dimers and translocate to the nucleus (Darnell
  et al. 1994).
