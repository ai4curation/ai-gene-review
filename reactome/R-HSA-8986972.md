display_name: IL24 binds IL20RA:JAK1:IL20RB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-24 (IL24) binds a receptor complex containing Interleukin-20
  Receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA) associated with Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1)
  (Andoh et al. 2009, Logsdon et al. 2012) and Interleukin-20 receptor subunit beta
  (IL20RB) (Parrish Novak et al.1998). Furthermore IL24 can also bind Interleukin-22
  receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL22RA1) and IL20RB (Wang et al. 2002) to form a ligand
  receptor complex. <br>As it is not clear whether the receptor complex can form in
  the absence of ligand, formation of the receptor dimer is represented here as an
  uncertain event.
