display_name: Core MLL complex methylates H3K4Me2-Nucleosome at the ITGA2B gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The WDR5-containing histone methyltransferase MLL complex, recruited to the
  ITGA2B promoter via RUNX1 (and possibly GATA1), methylates histone H3 on dimethylated
  lysine residue K4 (K5 when taking into account the initiator methionine), producing
  the H3K4me3 mark. The H3K4me3 mark is characteristic of nucleosomes associated with
  transcriptionally active promoters of megakaryocyte-specific genes (Herglotz et
  al. 2013).
