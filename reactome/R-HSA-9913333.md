display_name: DGC complex binds laminins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DAG1 is present in the dystroglycan-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC)
  as non-covalently associated alpha and beta subunits following cleavage at Ser654.
  The extracellular alpha subunit binds to LAMA2 (laminin-2, also known as merosin)
  in the muscle basement membrane while the membrane-associated beta subunit binds
  dystrophin (DMD), which associates with the actin cytoskeleton (Ervasti & Campbell
  1993, Yamada et al. 1994, Talts et al. 1999). Alpha-DAG1 also binds the carboxy-terminal
  G domains of  laminin alpha-1 (LAMA1; Gee et al. 1993, Zhou et al. 2012) and alpha-5
  (LAMA5; Yu & Talts 2003). G domains are relatively well conserved in all five alpha-laminin
  chains, so alpha-DAG1 is likely to bind all laminin heterotrimers. Gycosylation
  of the alpha-DAG1 subunit is critical for interactions with laminins (Yoshida-Moriguchi
  et al, 2010; Inamori et al, 2012).

## Summary

DAG1 is present in the dystroglycan-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC) as non-covalently associated alpha and beta subunits following cleavage at Ser654. The extracellular alpha subunit binds to LAMA2 (laminin-2, also known as merosin) in the muscle basement membrane while the membrane-associated beta subunit binds dystrophin (DMD), which associates with the actin cytoskeleton (Ervasti & Campbell 1993, Yamada et al. 1994, Talts et al. 1999). Alpha-DAG1 also binds the carboxy-terminal G domains of  laminin alpha-1 (LAMA1; Gee et al. 1993, Zhou et al. 2012) and alpha-5 (LAMA5; Yu & Talts 2003). G domains are relatively well conserved in all five alpha-laminin chains, so alpha-DAG1 is likely to bind all laminin heterotrimers. Gycosylation of the alpha-DAG1 subunit is critical for interactions with laminins (Yoshida-Moriguchi et al, 2010; Inamori et al, 2012).
