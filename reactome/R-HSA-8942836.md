summary: 'T-loop phosphorylation of CDK4 and CDK6 on threonine residues T172 and T177,
  respectively, is necessary for catalytic activity of complexes of CDK4 and CDK6
  with D-type cyclins (CCND1, CCND2 and CCND3) (Kato, Matsuoka, Strom and Sherr 1994,
  Merzel-Schachter et al. 2013, Bisteau et al. 2013). These phosphorylations depend
  on prior D type cyclin binding (Kato, Matsuoka, Polyak et al. 1994, Bockstaele et
  al. 2006). The T-loop phosphorylation is not precluded by the association of CDK4/6:CCND
  complexes to Cip/Kip cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors CDKN1A (p21Cip) and
  CDKN1B (p27Kip1), however high expression levels of CDKN1B reduce the T172 phosphorylation
  of CDK4 (Kato, Matsuoka, Polyak et al. 1994, Bockstaele et al. 2006, Ray et al.
  2009). Phosphorylation at tyrosine residue Y89 of CDKN1B (p27Kip1) bound to CDK4:CCND
  complexes was found to be necessary for phosphorylation of CDK4 by the CAK complex
  (composed of CDK7, CCNH and MAT1) in vitro, but not for the phosphorylation by CSK1
  of S. pombe (Ray et al. 2009). T-loop phosphorylations of CDK4 and CDK6 are differentially
  regulated (Bockstaele et al. 2009). Especially, the T172 phosphorylation of CDK4
  is strictly controlled by mitogenic and antimitogenic pathways (Paternot and Roger
  2009), and it can be differentially regulated in cyclin D1:CDK4 and cyclin D3:CDK4
  complexes (reviewed by Paternot et al. 2010). The T-loop T172 phosphorylation motif
  of CDK4 differs from the other cell cycle CDKs, including CDK6, by the presence
  of an adjacent proline residue (P173) that is evolutionarily conserved. This proline
  residue is required for T172 phosphorylation of CDK4 in vivo, but not for its in
  vitro phosphorylation by CAK. This indicates that CDK4 might be activated by other
  proline-directed kinases in vivo (Bockstaele et al. 2009). Nevertheless, in HCT116
  colon carcinoma cell line, the activity of CDK7 is required for the T172 phosphorylation
  of CDK4 and the activity of CDK4/6:CCND complexes (Merzel Schachter et al. 2013,
  Bisteau et al. 2013). T170 phosphorylation of CDK7 facilitates the activity of CAK
  on CDK4 (Merzel Schachter et al. 2013). However, CDK7 inhibition in HCT116 cells
