stable_id: R-HSA-166058
display_name: MyD88:MAL(TIRAP) cascade initiated on plasma membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The first known downstream component of TLR4 and TLR2 signaling is the adaptor
  MyD88. Another adapter MyD88-adaptor-like (Mal; also known as TIR-domain-containing
  adaptor protein or TIRAP) has also been described for TLR4 and TLR2 signaling. MyD88
  comprises an N-terminal Death Domain (DD) and a C-terminal TIR, whereas Mal lacks
  the DD. The TIR homotypic interactions bring adapters into contact with the activated
  TLRs, whereas the DD modules recruit serine/threonine kinases such as interleukin-1-receptor-associated
  kinase (IRAK). Recruitment of these protein kinases is accompanied by phosphorylation,
  which in turn results in the interaction of IRAKs with TNF-receptor-associated factor
  6 (TRAF6). The oligomerization of TRAF6 activates TAK1, a member of the MAP3-kinase
  family, and this leads to the activation of the IkB kinases. These kinases, in turn,
  phosphorylate IkB, leading to its proteolytic degradation and the translocation
  of NF-kB to the nucleus. Concomitantly, members of the activator protein-1 (AP-1)
  transcription factor family, Jun and Fos, are activated, and both AP-1 transcription
  factors and NF-kB are required for cytokine production, which in turn produces downstream
  inflammatory effects.

## Summary
