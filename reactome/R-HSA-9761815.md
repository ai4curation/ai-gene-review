summary: 'SLC7A11 encodes one component of system xc-, a heterodimeric high affinity
  cystine-glutamate transporter that imports cystine in exchange for glutamate; the
  other protein component of the heterodimer is SLC3A2 (reviewed in Lewerenz et al,
  2013). System xc- contributes to redox balance of the cell by increasing intracellular
  stores of cysteine, a limiting component in the synthesis of the key antioxidant
  glutathione (GSH). Depletion of GSH, for instance by inhibition of SLC7A11, causes
  lipid peroxidation and stimulates ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death (reiewed
  in Chen et al, 2021; Kuang et al, 2020; Kajarabille and Latunde-Dada, 2019).

  NFE2L2 is a major transcriptional regulator of genes involved in mitigating oxidative
  stress, and as such effectively acts as a negative regulator of the ferroptosis
  pathway (reviewed in Baird and Yamamoto, 2020; Kuang et al, 2020; Chen et al, 2021).
  SLC7A11 expression is upregulated in response to NFE2L2 inducers and has been shown
  to be a direct downstream target of NFE2L2 and ATF4 (Ye et al, 2014; Ishii et al,
  2000; Sasaki et al, 2002; Chen et al, 2017; Dong et al, 2020; reviewed in Kuang
  et al, 2020; Kajarabille and Latunde-Dada, 2019). CREBBP also co-immunoprecipitates
  with NFE2L2 at the SLC7A11, and CREBBP-dependent acetylation of NFE2L2 is required
  for promoter binding and transcriptional activation (Chen et al, 2017; Sun et al,
  2009). The acetylation activity of CREBBP is inhibited by interaction between p14ARF
  and NFE2L2 at the SLC7A11 promoter (Chen et al, 2017).'
