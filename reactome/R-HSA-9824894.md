display_name: TBK1 is phosphorylated within TBK1:OPTN:Ub-mitochondrial proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon mitochondrial damage, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is recruited to the
  damaged mitochondria through a direct interaction with the autophagy receptor optineurin
  (OPTN) (Heo JM et al., 2015; Richter B et al., 2016). Once at the mitochondria,
  TBK1 undergoes phosphorylation at S172 within the activation loop (Heo JM et al.,
  2015; Richter B et al., 2016). The phosphorylation of TBK1 is a crucial step in
  its activation (Ma X et al., 2012). Mitochondria-bound active TBK1, in turn, phosphorylates
  OPTN (Richter B et al., 2016) and other autophagy adaptors (Matsumoto G et al.,
  2015) thereby facilitating selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria. Several
  loss-of-function mutations in the TBK1 gene may contribute to pathology of neurodegenerative
  disorders due to impaired autophagy (Li F et al., 2018; Harding O et al., 2021).
