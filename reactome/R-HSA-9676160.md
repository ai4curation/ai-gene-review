stable_id: R-HSA-9676160
display_name: AAMP binds NOD2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AAMP (Angio-associated migratory cell protein) binds the human nucleotide-binding
  domain, leucine rich repeat containing (NLR) family member NOD2. The interaction
  involves WD40 domains 2-4 of AAMP. NOD2 is critically involved in innate immune
  protection against a variety of different bacterial pathogens. AAMP negatively regulates,
  through an unknown mechanism, NOD2-mediated NF-κB activation in HEK293T cells (Bielig
  et al. 2009).
