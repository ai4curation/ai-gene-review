stable_id: R-HSA-2160492
display_name: IL4I1:FAD oxidises L-Phe to kPPV
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Extracellular L-amino-acid oxidase (IL4I1) catalyzes the reaction of phenylalanine,
  water, and molecular oxygen to form  keto-phenylpyruvate, ammonia, and hydrogen
  peroxide. IL4I1, inferred to form a complex with FAD, has L-amino acid oxidase activity
  and with a strong preference for phenylalanine. The enzyme, found both in lysosomes
  and secreted into the extracellular space, is produced in the body by myeloid and
  dedritic cells (Boulland et al. 2007).
