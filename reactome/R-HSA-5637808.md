display_name: SOS-mediated nucleotide exchange of RAS (mediated by GRB2:SOS1 in complex
  with phosphorylated SHC1 and p-EGFRvIII)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SOS1 is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAS. SOS1, recruited
  by GRB2 bound to p-SHC1:p-EGFRvIII mutant, is assumed to activate RAS nucleotide
  exchange from the inactive form (bound to GDP) to an active form (bound to GTP).
  Although this reaction has not been shown to occur directly for EGFRvIII cancer
  mutant, activation of RAF/MAP kinase cascade has been demonstrated in cells expressing
  EGFRvIII (Montgomery et al. 1995).
