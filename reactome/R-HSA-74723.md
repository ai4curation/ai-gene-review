stable_id: R-HSA-74723
display_name: Endosome acidification
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The effect of the proton pump is to allow entry of [H+] ions into the lumen
  of the endosome. The net effect of this is to lower the pH of the lumen from pH
  7.4 (the pH at the plasma membrane) to pH 6.0 (documented with studies using FITC-labeled
  insulin - a pH dependent fluorescence marker).
