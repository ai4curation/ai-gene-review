display_name: Biosynthesis of D-series resolvins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The D-series resolvins (RvD1-6) are biosynthesised from the precursor ω-3
  fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), either via aspirin-triggered cylcooxygenase
  catalysis (17(R) AT-RvDs) or via the lipoxygenase pathway (described here) forming
  the epimeric 17(S)-RvD1-6 resolvins (Serhan et al. 2014, Bannenberg & Serhan 2010).
