stable_id: R-HSA-9013361
display_name: NEXT3 is cleaved to produce NICD3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NEXT3 fragment of NOTCH3 is further cleaved at the S3 site by the gamma-secretase
  complex, containing either PSEN1 (presenilin-1) or PSEN2 (presenilin-2) as the catalytic
  subunit, which releases the intracellular domain NICD3 into the cytosol (Groot et
  al. 2014).
