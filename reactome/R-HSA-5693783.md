display_name: NAALADases hydrolyse NAAG
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Excessive glutamate has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and
  stroke. One source of glutamate is the hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG),
  a neurotransmitter found in the brain. NAAG can be hydrolysed by glutamate carboxypeptidase
  2 (FOLH1), a membrane-bound, homodimeric enzyme which possesses both folate hydrolase
  and N-acetylated-alpha-linked-acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase) activity (Mesters et
  al. 2006). Inhibition of FOLH1 could have neuroprotective effects (Wozniak et al.
  2012). Other dipeptidases able to hydrolyse NAAG are N-acetylated-alpha-linked acidic
  dipeptidase 2 (NAALAD2) (Pangalos et al. 1999, Hlouchova et al. 2009) and putative
  N-acetylated-alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase (FOLH1B) (O'Keefe et al. 2004).
