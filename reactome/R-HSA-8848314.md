stable_id: R-HSA-8848314
display_name: IL36:IL1RL2 binds IL1RAP-1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After binding of IL36 to IL1RL2, the complex associates with the coreceptor
  IL1RAP to form the interleukin-36 receptor complex. The IL-36 signaling system is
  thought to be present in epithelial barriers and to take part in local inflammatory
  response; it is similar to the IL-1 system (Gresnigt & van de Veerdonk 2013).
