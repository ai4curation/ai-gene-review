stable_id: R-HSA-9929904
display_name: CCNA:CDK1 phosphorylates MIS18BP1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MIS18BP1 (also known as M18BP1 or Mis18-binding protein 1), a component of
  the MIS18 complex that regulates targeting of CENPA to centromeres (Fujita et al.
  2007), was reproducibly identified as a CCNA:CDK1 target in a high-throughput screen
  (Dumitru et al. 2017). In G2, phosphorylation of a consensus CDK site T653 in MIS18BP1,
  which is dependent on CDK1/CDK2 activity, prevents premature recruitment of MIS18BP1
  to the centromeres, while it does not affect the assembly of the MIS18 complex (Stankovic
  et al. 2017).
