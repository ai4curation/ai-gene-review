summary: 'Troponin (Tn) is the central regulatory protein of striated muscle contraction.
  Tn consists of three components: troponin I (TNNI3; the inhibitor of actomyosin
  ATPase), Tn-T (which contains the binding site for tropomyosin) and troponin C (TNNC1,
  Tn-C). The binding of calcium to TNNC1 abolishes the inhibitory action of Tn on
  actin filaments. At the start of the striated muscle contraction cycle, a myosin
  head lacking a bound nucleotide is locked tightly onto an actin filament in a rigor
  conformation. TNNC1 binds four calcium ions. In an actively contracting muscle this
  state is very short-lived, being rapidly terminated by the binding of a molecule
  of ATP.'
