species: Homo sapiens
summary: Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1(JAK1) and Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK3 (JAK3)
  are believed to be phosphorylated after stimulation of the Interleukin-15 receptor
  complex by Interleukin-15 (IL15) (Johnston et al. 1995), though it has been reported
  that only JAK3 phosphorylation increases in response to IL15 (Krolopp et al. 2016).
  The Interleukin-15 receptor complex consists of IL15, Interleukin-15 receptor alpha
  subunit (IL15RA, IL15Rα), Interleukin-2 receptor beta subunit (IL2RB, IL2Rβ), which
  is associated with JAK1 and Interleukin receptor gamma subunit, which is associated
  with JAK3 (Johnston et al. 1995). This is a black box event since the mechanism
  by which IL15 promotes JAK phosphorylation is unclear.
