display_name: PXN binds p-6Y,S732-PTK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Paxillin (PXN) is a multidomain scaffolding protein localized primarily in
  focal adhesions. It binds with focal adhesion kinase (FAK1, also known as PTK2)
  and is recruited to the focal adhesions. VEGF induced a quick and marked increase
  in the recruitment of both paxillin and vinculin to FAK (Abedi & Zachary 1997).
