display_name: Camkk2 phosphorylates CAMK4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the presence of recombinant calmodulin, recombinant rat Camkk2 (CaMKK-beta)
  phosphorylates recombinant human CAMK4 (CaMKIV) (Anderson et al. 1998). Recombinant
  calmodulin is assumed to be human as CALM1 seqeuence is 100% conserved between human,
  rat and mouse.

## Summary

In the presence of recombinant calmodulin, recombinant rat Camkk2 (CaMKK-beta) phosphorylates recombinant human CAMK4 (CaMKIV) (Anderson et al. 1998). Recombinant calmodulin is assumed to be human as CALM1 seqeuence is 100% conserved between human, rat and mouse.
