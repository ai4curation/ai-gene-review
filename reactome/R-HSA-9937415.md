display_name: MTRF1 and GTP bind 55S ribosome:MT-CO1,MT-ND6 mRNA:peptidyl-tRNA at
  P-site:tRNA at E-site
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The mitochondrial translation termination factor MTRF1 recognizes the noncanonical
  stop codons AGA, located in the MT-ND6 mRNA, and AGG, located in the MT-CO1 mRNA,
  when the codons are in the A-site of the mitochondrial 55S ribosome (Saurer et al.
  2023). The codon recognition loop of MTRF1 enters the A site, distorts the  mRNA,
  and displaces the first two bases of the codon toward the 28S ribosomal subunit
  (Saurer et al. 2023).
