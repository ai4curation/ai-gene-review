display_name: Activation of RAC1 by VAV
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Rac1 exists in inactive state in the cytosol until the reception of extracellular
  signals by the cell. To be functional Rac1 is rapidly targeted to the plasma membrane
  upon cell stimulation. The main factors involved in this mobilisation are the Rac
  GEFs like VAV and phospholipids (PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,4,5) P3) and lipid rafts
  at the plasma membrane. VAV catalyses the disassociation of GDP from Rac1 by modifying
  the nucleotide-binding site such that GDP is released and subsequently replaced.
  The incoming GTP occupies the nucleotide binding site and finally displaces VAV
  from Rac1 (Bos et al. 2007, Bustelo et al. 2012).
