stable_id: R-HSA-4420121
display_name: SFKs phosphorylate PLCG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activation of VEGFR2 has been shown to lead to direct binding and phosphorylation
  of PLC-gamma 1 (McLaughlin & Vries 2001). PLCG1 is tyrosine phosphorylated directly
  by VEGFR2 or through the Src kinases on four tyrosine residues, enhancing the activity
  of PLCG1.
