# STAT4 binds p-Y-IL23R in IL23:IL23 receptor
**Reactome ID:** [R-HSA-8952749](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-8952749)
**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) is believed to bind Interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) in response to Interleukin-23 (IL23). The sequence GY484KPQIS in IL23R is thought to be the STAT4 binding site as it resembles the STAT4 binding motif in IL12RB2 (Naeger at al. 1999, Yao et al. 1999). 
This is a black box event because there is no direct evidence of STAT4 binding in response to IL23. Note that theris no evidence to suggest that STAT3 binding precedes STAT4 association.
