display_name: CTNNB1 S33 mutants aren't phosphorylated by GSK3beta
species: Homo sapiens
summary: S33 mutations of beta-catenin interfere with GSK3 phosphorylation and result
  in stabilization and nuclear localization of the protein and enhanced WNT signaling
  (Groen et al, 2008; Nhieu et al, 1999; Clements et al, 2002; reviewed in Polakis,
  2000).  S33 mutations have been identified in cancers of the central nervous system,
  liver, endometrium and stomach, among others (reviewed in Polakis, 2000).
