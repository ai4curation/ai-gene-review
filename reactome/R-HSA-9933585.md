display_name: RNA exosome in PAXT:PAPOLG:TENT4A,B:ZC3H3:CBCA:polyadenylated m7GpppN-RNA:PABPN1
  hydrolyzes RNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The RNA exosome 3'-5' exonucleolytically hydrolyzes RNA (Liu et al. 2006,
  Januszyk et al. 2011, Weick et al. 2018). The PAXT connection recruits the RNA exosome
  to degrade polyadenylated RNAs (Meola et al. 2016). RNAs that are normally targeted
  by the NEXT complex can become targeted to the PAXT connection if they are polyadenylated
  (Wu et al. 2020, Wu et al. 2024).
