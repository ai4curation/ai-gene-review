display_name: mito-STARD7 transports Q10 to outer mitochondrial membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mitochondrial STARD7 is a lipid carrier that is required for transport of
  Q10H2 between inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (Deshwal et al., 2023; reviewed
  in Guile et al., 2023). In yeast, Cqd1 and Cqd2, two proteins containing atypical
  kinase/ATPase domains similar to those found in COQ8, regulate the cellular distribution
  of CoQ (Kemmerer et al., 2021).
