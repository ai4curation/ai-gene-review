stable_id: R-HSA-9824587
display_name: MITF-M-dependent BCL2 expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MITF binds to the promoter of the BCL2 gene to upregulate its expression
  (McGill et al, 2002; Genovese et al, 2012). MITF-dependent regulation of the anti-apoptotic
  factor BCL2 contributes to the survival of the melanocyte lineage and to the progression
  of melanoma, as demonstrated by the loss of the melanocyte lineage in BCL2 knockout
  mice and in cell lines (Yamamura et al, 1996; Trisciuoglio et al, 2005; reviewed
  in Hou and Pavan, 2008; Cheli et al, 2010; Goding and Arnheiter, 2019; Soengas and
  Lowe, 2003). Overexpression of BCL2 decreases expression of the MITF target miR-211,
  decreases the proportion of nuclear MITF and reduces MITF occupancy on promoters
  of target genes such as GPR143 (also known as MLANA) and TRPM1 (De Luca et al, 2016).
