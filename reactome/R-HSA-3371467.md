display_name: SIRT1 deacetylates HSF1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) functions as a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, which regulates
  the heat shock response through deacetylation of HSF1 at Lys80. The acetylation
  at Lys80, which is located within DNA binding domain of HSF1 disrupts HSF1 DNA-binding
  ability. SIRT1-mediated stress-inducible regulation of HSF1 results in prolonged
  HSF1 binding to the heat shock promoter of hsp70 gene. The mechanism of the enzymatic
  reaction which couples NAD(+) hydrolysis with lysine deacetylation in the presence
  of acetylated peptide is described by several groups (Landry J et al. 2000; Sauve
  AA et al. 2001)
