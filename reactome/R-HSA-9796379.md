## Summary

The N-terminal methionine-linked ubiquitin (Met1-Ub) chains, or linear Ub chains, are conjugated to target proteins by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) composed of HOIL-1L, HOIP, and SHARPIN (Kirisako T et al. 2006; Walczak H et al. 2012). LUBAC and linear polyubiquitination has been implicated in the regulation of innate immunity and cell death (Tokunaga F et al. 2011; Gerlach B et al. 2011).

The CYLD interaction with LUBAC is facilitated by spermatogenesis-associated protein 2 (SPATA2) (Elliott PR et al. 2016; Kupka S et al. 2016; Schlicher L et al. 2016; Wagner SA et al. 2016).
