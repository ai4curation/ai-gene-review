stable_id: R-HSA-389348
display_name: Activation of Rac1 by pVav1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon activation by PIP3 binding and phosphorylation by Fyn kinase, Vav1 acts
  as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac. Vav1 specifically catalyzes
  the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac, leading to its activation. This process is crucial
  for downstream signaling events that regulate cell movement, cytoskeletal rearrangements,
  and immune cell function (Crespo et al. 1997).
