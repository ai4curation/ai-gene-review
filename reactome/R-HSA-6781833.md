stable_id: R-HSA-6781833
display_name: ERCC8 (CSA) binds stalled RNA Pol II
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cockayne syndrome protein A (ERCC8, also known as CSA) is recruited to a
  stalled RNA polymerase II complex (RNA Pol II) at a site of DNA damage in an ERCC6
  (CSB) dependent manner (Kamiuchi et al. 2002; van der Weegen et al. 2020). ERCC8
  is part of an ubiquitin ligase complex that, in addition to ERCC8, also contains
  DDB1, CUL4 (CUL4A or CUL4B) and RBX1 (Groisman et al. 2003). The COP9 signalosome
  complex prevents the ubiquitin ligase activity of the ERCC8:DDB1:CUL4:RBX1 at the
  early steps after DNA damage induction (Groisman et al. 2003, Fischer et al. 2011).
