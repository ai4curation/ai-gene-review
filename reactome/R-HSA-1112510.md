stable_id: R-HSA-1112510
display_name: IL6ST is tyrosine phosphorylated
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated JAKs are believed to be responsible for phosphorylating the cytoplasmic
  region of IL6ST (gp130) (Wang & Fuller 1994, Reich & Liu 2006) creating docking
  sites for adaptor and downstream signaling molecules, in particular the factors
  STAT1 and STAT3. Several phosphotyrosine residues of IL6ST are docking sites for
  STATs (Stahl et al. 1995, Gerhartz et al. 1996), Tyr-759 phosphorylation allows
  recruitment of the phosphatase SHP2.
