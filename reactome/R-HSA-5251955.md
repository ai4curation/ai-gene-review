species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Protein Hikeshi (C11orf73) is a nuclear import carrier protein for heat-shock
  70 proteins (HSP70s) in response to heat-shock stress. It is only able to bind HSP70s
  when they are bound to ATP. DnaJ homolog subfamily members (aka heat-shock 40 proteins,
  HSP40s) also translocate to the nucleus under heat-shock stress (Hattori et al.
  1992) and can act as stimulators of intrinsic ATPase activity of HSP70s. The result
  is that Hikeshi dissociates from HSP70:ADP.  '
