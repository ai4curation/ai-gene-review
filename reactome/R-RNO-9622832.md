display_name: Hspa8 dissociates from Lamp2a-bound substrate
species: Rattus norvegicus
summary: Intracellular proteins are targeted for proteolytic degradation in lysosome
  with the aid of chaperones. Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) acts as the
  constitutive chaperone that binds a KFERQ-domain containing substrate in the cytosol.
  Consequently, the substrate:Hspa8 complex translocates from the cytosol to the lysosomal
  membrane where it binds to Lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2 (Lamp2).
  Post-binding, Hspa8 is released from the complex to allow multimerization of Lamp2
  and internalization of the substrate (Bandyopadhyay U et al. 2008).
