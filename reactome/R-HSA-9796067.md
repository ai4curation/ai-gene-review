display_name: PRKAA2 phosphorylates nuclear NFE2L2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PRKAA2 phosphorylates NFE2L2 at the Ser558 residue (Ser550 in mouse) which
  is located in the canonical nuclear export signal leading to inhibition of NFE2L2
  nuclear transport and enhanced nuclear retention. (Joo et al, 2016))
