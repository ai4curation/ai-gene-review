display_name: Loading of antigenic peptides on to class I MHC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MHC class I heterodimers are only stable in peptide bound form and only as
  a trimer (with bound peptide) present on the cell surface. Class I MHC molecules
  prefer nonapeptides, and less frequently use octa- or deca-peptides. The peptide
  binding groove in MHC class I molecules is formed by the intimate association of
  the alpha1 and alpha2 domains of the heavy chain. Structural studies have revealed
  that the alpha1:alpha2 domains form a single peptide binding groove consisting of
  2 parallel helices on a floor of 8 beta-strands. Hydrogen bonding networks are established
  in the binding groove with the antigenic peptide main chain and terminal atoms that
  enable largely sequence independent ligation. Upon peptide binding the class I MHC
  molecule releases from the peptide loading complex (PLC) and clusters at  ER exit
  sites and is finally exported to the cell surface.<br>MHC I molecules bound to low-affinity
  peptides are not transferred to the cell surface and are instead cycled back to
  ER. They can proceed to the cell surface only when they become bound to high-affinity
  peptide (Howe et al, 2009; Garstka et al, 2007). Calreticulin binds to these low-affinity
  peptide bound class I molecules and mediate the retrieval from golgi apparatus to
  ER and for effcient presentation of a model antigen (Howe et al, 2009).
