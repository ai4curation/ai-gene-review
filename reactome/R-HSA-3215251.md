stable_id: R-HSA-3215251
display_name: TP53INP1 and HIPK2 bind TP53
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TP53INP1 (p53INP1) forms a complex with TP53 and its regulating kinase HIPK2
  (Tomasini et al. 2003, Okamura et al. 2001). HIPK2 undergoes autophosphorylation
  in response to DNA damage, but the mechanism and the identity of autophosphorylation
  sites have not yet been fully elucidated (Bitomsky et al. 2013, Saul et al. 2013,
  Siepi et al. 2013). Autophosphorylation enables HIPK2 binding to PIN1. PIN1 likely
  facilitates a conformational change that enables HIPK2 to phosphorylate its targets,
  including TP53 (Bitomsky et al. 2013).

## Summary

TP53INP1 (p53INP1) forms a complex with TP53 and its regulating kinase HIPK2 (Tomasini et al. 2003, Okamura et al. 2001). HIPK2 undergoes autophosphorylation in response to DNA damage, but the mechanism and the identity of autophosphorylation sites have not yet been fully elucidated (Bitomsky et al. 2013, Saul et al. 2013, Siepi et al. 2013). Autophosphorylation enables HIPK2 binding to PIN1. PIN1 likely facilitates a conformational change that enables HIPK2 to phosphorylate its targets, including TP53 (Bitomsky et al. 2013).
