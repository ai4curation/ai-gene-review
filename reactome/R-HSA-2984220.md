stable_id: R-HSA-2984220
display_name: CDK1:CCNB phosphorylates NEK9
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NEK9 functions as a homodimer and becomes catalytically active in mitosis
  through phosphorylation (Roig et al. 2002). While threonine T333 of NEK9 is phosphorylated
  in both interphase and mitotic cells (Roig et al. 2005, Bertran et al. 2011), serine
  residues S29, S750 and S869 of NEK9 are phosphorylated only in mitotic cells. S29,
  S750 and S869 sites are proline directed and match the CDK1 consensus sequence (Bertran
  et al. 2011). CDK1:CCNB complex was shown to phosphorylate NEK9 in vitro (Roig et
  al. 2002).
