display_name: POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, PBX1, SMAD2 bind the NANOG promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: KLF4, PBX1, POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, and NANOG bind the promoter of the NANOG
  gene and enhance expression of NANOG (Rodda et al. 2005, Boyer et al. 2005, Babaie
  et al. 2007, Jin et al. 2007, Chan et al. 2009, Vallier et al. 2009,  Jung et al.
  2011). In mouse Nanog has been shown to repress its own expression (Fidalgo et al.
  2012, Navarro et al. 2012). ZIC3, a NANOG target, also positively regulates NANOG
  expression, possibly by binding the NANOG promoter and activating transcription
  (Lim et al. 2007). Activin/Nodal signaling regulates NANOG via SMAD2 and SMAD3 (Brown
  et al. 2011)
