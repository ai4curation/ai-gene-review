## Summary

Following ubiquitination NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA or IκBα) is rapidly degraded by 26S-proteasome, allowing NF-kB to translocate into the nucleus where it activates gene transcription (Spencer et al. 1999).<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 1a-encoded papain-like protease (PLPro or nsp3) was found to cleave Lys48-linked polyUb chains of NFKBIA (IκBα) (Békés M et al. 2016;Ratia K et al. 2014) suggesting an inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-1 nsp3 on 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of NFKBIA.
