display_name: ATR phosphorylates RPA2, FANCI, FANCD2 and FANCM at ICL-DNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATR phosphorylates several proteins at DNA insterstrand crosslinks (ICL-DNA),
  with ATR activity at ICL-DNA being independent of the presence of RAD17 and TOPBP1
  (Shigechi et al. 2012, Tomida et al. 2013). Besides phosphorylating the RPA2 subunit
  of the RPA heterotrimeric complex (Huang et al. 2010), activated ATR also phosphorylates
  the Fanconi anemia core complex component FANCM on serine residue S1045 (Singh et
  al. 2013). ATR-mediated phosphorylation of FANCM is thought to be important for
  the progression of ICL repair, although the mechanism is not known. The critical
  ATR substrate at ICL-DNA is considered to be FANCI component of the ID2 complex.
  ATR-mediated phosphorylation of FANCI, at least on serine residues S556, S559, S565
  and S617, is a prerequisite for FANCD2 monoubiquitination (Ishiai et al. 2008, Shigechi
  et al. 2012). FANDC2 itself is also phosphorylated by ATR on threonine residue T691
  and serine residue S717, which promotes FANCD2 monoubiquitination and enhances cellular
  resistance to DNA crosslinking agents (Ho et al. 2006).
