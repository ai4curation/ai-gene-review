## Summary

Dimeric medial Golgins CUX1 (also known as CASP) and GOLGA5 (also known as Golgin-84) act in conjunction with the COG complex to tether retrograde vesicles moving within the Golgi stacks (Bascom et al, 1999; Gillingham et al, 2002; Malsam et al, 2005; Sohda et al, 2007; Sohda et al, 2010; reviewedin Szul and Sztul, 2011).  Intra-Golgi vesicles are COPI-dependent, but distinct from anterograde ERGIC-to-Golgi COPI vesicles by virtue of their cargo (generally returning Golgi and ER-resident enzymes to their appropriate location in the secretory pathway, and notably lacking p24 family members; other intra Golgi cargo includes toxins such as Shiga) and the SNARE complexes they interact with (Orci et al, 1997; Lanoix et al, 2001; Malsam et al, 2005).
