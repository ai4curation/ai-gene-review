stable_id: R-HSA-8952419
display_name: SMURFs ubiquitinate RUNX3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SMURF1 and SMURF2 polyubiquitinate RUNX3 on unknown lysine residues, possibly
  K148, K186 and K192, targeting it for degradation. The interaction between SMURFs
  and RUNX3 involves the PY motif of RUNX3 and the WW domain of SMURFs. Acetylation
  of RUNX3 by EP300 (p300) prevents SMURF-mediated ubiquitination of RUNX3, thus increasing
  RUNX3 protein stability (Jin et al. 2004).
