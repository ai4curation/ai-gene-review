display_name: RAB3IP stimulates nucleotide exchange on RAB8A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once recruited to the ciliary targeting complex, RAB3IP/RABIN8 stimulates
  nucleotide exchange on RAB8A. Activated RAB8A is required for ciliogenesis and plays
  a role in mediating vesicle docking at the basal body, providing both lipid and
  protein content to the emerging cilium (Hattula et al, 2002; Knodler et al, 2010;
  Nachury et al, 2007; Wang et al, 2012; Westlake et al, 2011; Yoshimura et al, 2007;
