summary: Characterisation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6)-deficient
  mice suggests that Interleukin-13 (IL13) signaling, like Interleukin-4 (IL4) signaling,
  uses STAT6 (Takeda et al. 1996, Kaplan et al. 1996). In humans STAT6 is activated
  in response to IL4 and IL13 (Wang et al. 2004) and can bind tyrosine-phosphorylated
  Interleukin-4 receptor subunit alpha (IL4R) (Hou et al. 1994, Schindler et al. 1996,
  Mikita et al. 1998), but in response to IL13, STAT6 binds Interleukin-13 receptor
  subunit alpha 1 (IL13RA1), to be phosphorylated by Non-receptor associated tyrosine
  kinase 2 (TYK2) (Bhattacharjee et al. 2013).<br><br>Binding and phosphorylation

  et al. 2013)  but not IL4 (Friedrich et al. 1999), suggesting that STAT3 binding
  might depend on IL13RA, but recently STAT3 was reported to associate with IL4R and
