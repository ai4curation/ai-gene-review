stable_id: R-HSA-212222
display_name: PRC2 recruits DNA methyltransferases
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In tumor cells the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 associates with a DNA methyltransferase
  (DNMT) via the N-terminal region of EZH2 (Vire et al. 2006). DNMT1, DNMT3a, and
  DNMT3b can each bind EZH2 though only one is bound at any time. As inferred from
  mouse (Rush et al. 2009), EZH2 tethered to a locus is able to recruit Dnmt3a but
  additional factors may be required to trigger de novo DNA methylation. It is unknown
  if the DNMT is recruited only after PRC2 has been targeted to a locus.
