display_name: Procollagen triple helix formation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Alignment of the C-terminal prodomains initiates triple helix formation,
  which propagates in a zipper-like fashion in the C-to-N direction. This occurs in
  the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Engel & Prockop 1991). Compared with the folding
  of globular proteins and coiled-coil structures, the concentration-independent folding
  steps of collagen are extremely slow (Bächinger et al. 1980). Triple helix formation
  combines a fast process, interpreted as the folding of regions devoid of cis residues,
  and a slow process, limited by the slow kinetics of cis to trans prolyl-isomerization
  (Bächinger et al. 1978). Triple-helix formation in regions devoid of cis-prolyl
  bonds is 3-4 times faster than formation limited by prolyl isomerization reactions  (Bachmann
  et al. 2005). Conversion to trans is required as only trans-peptide bonds can be
  incorporated into the collagen triple helix (Zeng et al. 1998). Efficient helix
  folding requires the presence of the 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex. This trimer
  of Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (LEPRE1), Cyclophilin B (CyPB), also called Peptidyl-prolyl
  cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) and CRTAP has 3-prolyl hydroxylase, PPIase and procollagen
  chaperone properties (Ishikawa et al. 2009, van Dijk et al. 2009). Efficient folding
  involves additional collagen-specific chaperones such as Serpin H1 (HSP47 - Smith
  et al. 1995). CyPB belongs to the cyclophilins, a conserved class of intracellular
  and/or secreted proteins originally identified as cellular binding proteins for
  the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. They are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases
  (PPIases), which catalyze the cis-trans isomerisation of peptide bonds. CyPB localises
  to the rough ER but is also secreted extracellularly. It directly interacts with
  procollagen and is believed to  be responsible for converting procollagen cis- to
  trans-conformers (Zeng et al. 1998). CyPB and Serpin H1 are also involved in procollagen
  export and secretion. Results obtained with collagen peptides suggest that variations
  in the Gly-X-Y sequence are likely to result in a non-uniform helical twist along
  the length of a collagen fibril. Sequences poor in imino acids will have a symmetry
  close to 10 tripeptide units for every 3 turns of the triple helix (10/3), while
  stretches of Gly-Pro-Hyp units may have 7/2 symmetry (Brodsky & Persikov 2005).

## Summary

Alignment of the C-terminal prodomains initiates triple helix formation, which propagates in a zipper-like fashion in the C-to-N direction. This occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Engel & Prockop 1991). Compared with the folding of globular proteins and coiled-coil structures, the concentration-independent folding steps of collagen are extremely slow (Bächinger et al. 1980).
