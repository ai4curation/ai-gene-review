display_name: LONP1 binds mitochondrial inner membrane proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: LONP1 binds a substrate protein in an ATP-independent manner and then degrades
  the the substrate protein using an ATP-dependent mechanism in which ATP hydrolysis
  translocates the substrate protein to the protease active site (Ambro et al. 2014,
  Shin et al. 2021, Mohammed et al. 2022). The binding of proteins to LONP1 can allosterically
  stimulate its ATPase activity (inferred from bacterial Lon proteases in Waxman et
  al. 1986, Lin et al. 2016). LONP1 binds, unfolds, and degrades several mitochondrial
  inner membrane proteins (Ondrovicova et al. 2005, Lee et al. 2021), including the
  mitochondrial processing peptidase subunit PMPCA (Ondrovicova et al. 2005).
