display_name: RAS GEFs promote RAS nucleotide exchange
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The human genome is predicted to encode 27 RAS guanine nucleotide exchange
  factors (GEFs) that promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on membrane-associated RAS
  in response to RAS-MAPK pathway activation by growth factors, hormones, cytokines
  and other stimuli (reviewed in Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013; Cargnello and Roux, 2011).  Nucleotide
  exchange stimulates a conformational change in RAS to facilitate its interaction
  with RAF, ultimately promoting the phosphorylation of downstream effectors MAPK3
  and MAPK1 (also known as ERK1 and ERK2) (reviewed in Cseh et al, 2014; Vigil et
  al, 2010).
