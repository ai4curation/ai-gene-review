display_name: Binding of ATR:ATRIP to RPA at resected DNA DSBs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATR (ATM- and rad3-related) kinase is an essential checkpoint factor in human
  cells constitutively associated with ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein). The ATR:ATRIP
  complex binds RPA complex (RPA1:RPA2:RPA3) associated with ssDNA at resected DNA
  double-strand breaks (DSBs). Complex formation is primarily mediated by physical
  interaction between ATRIP and RPA1 (Zou and Elledge 2003, Jazayeri et al. 2006).
