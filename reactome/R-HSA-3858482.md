display_name: DVL is recruited to the receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The DEP domain of dishevelled proteins (DVL) is required both for planar
  cell polarization (PCP) signaling and for membrane localization upon WNT activation
  (Boutros et al, 1998; Axelrod et al, 2001; Rothbacher et al, 2000, Wong et al, 2000;
  Park et al, 2005; Witzel et al, 2006).  Although DVL interacts with FZD through
  its PDZ domain, disruption of this binding interface does not interfere with non-canonical
  signaling (Wong et al, 2003). Membrane recruitment of DVL and establishment of PCP
  may also rely on other interacting partners (Lee et al, 2007; Li et al, 2013).

## Summary

The DEP domain of dishevelled proteins (DVL) is required both for planar cell polarization (PCP) signaling and for membrane localization upon WNT activation (Boutros et al, 1998; Axelrod et al, 2001; Rothbacher et al, 2000, Wong et al, 2000; Park et al, 2005; Witzel et al, 2006).  Although DVL interacts with FZD through its PDZ domain, disruption of this binding interface does not interfere with non-canonical signaling (Wong et al, 2003). Membrane recruitment of DVL and establishment of PCP may also rely on other interacting partners (Lee et al, 2007; Li et al, 2013).
