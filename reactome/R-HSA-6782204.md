display_name: 5' incision of damaged DNA strand by ERCC1:ERCC4 in TC-NER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), just like in
  global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), the cleavage of the damaged strand
  of DNA 5' to the site of damage occurs at the junction of single-stranded DNA and
  double-stranded DNA that is formed when the DNA duplex is unwound. The 5' incision
  is carried out by ERCC1:XPF (ERCC1:ERCC4) complex and precedes the 3' incision by
  ERCC5 (XPG) (Staresincic et al. 2009).
