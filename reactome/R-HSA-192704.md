display_name: Synthesis of PB1-F2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: For most influenza A strains (such as PR8), the PB1 mRNA segment produces
  a second protein, PB1-F2, from the +1 open reading frame (Chen, 2001).  PB1-F2 is
  a pro-apoptotic, mitochondria-localized protein (Chen, 2001; Gibbs, 2003) that oligomerizes
  (Bruns, 2007) and sensitizes cells to death in concert with the mitochondrial ANT3
  and VDAC proteins (Zamarin, 2005).
