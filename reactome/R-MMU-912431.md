display_name: Formation of Meiotic Heteroduplex
species: Mus musculus
summary: Following double strand break (DSB) formation and strand resection, Rad51
  and Dmc1 coat single-stranded 3' ends of DNA and catalyze the search for homology
  and strand invasion into the DNA duplex of the chromosomal homolog (Barlow et al.
  1997). The invading strand displaces the original strand of the chromosomal homolog
  creating a D-loop structure. Other proteins in the complex are inferred from cytology
  (Barlow et al. 1997, Plug et al. 1997, Plug et al. 1998, Moens et al. 2002).

# Formation of Meiotic Heteroduplex
**Reactome ID:** [R-MMU-912431](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-MMU-912431)
**Species:** Mus musculus

## Summary

Following double strand break (DSB) formation and strand resection, Rad51 and Dmc1 coat single-stranded 3' ends of DNA and catalyze the search for homology and strand invasion into the DNA duplex of the chromosomal homolog (Barlow et al. 1997). The invading strand displaces the original strand of the chromosomal homolog creating a D-loop structure. Other proteins in the complex are inferred from cytology (Barlow et al. 1997, Plug et al. 1997, Plug et al. 1998, Moens et al. 2002).
