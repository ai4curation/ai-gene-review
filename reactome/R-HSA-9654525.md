display_name: PDE6D binds S-Farn-Me KRAS4B:CALM:4 Ca2+
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PDE6D binds to prenylated KRAS4B after calmodulin-stimulated dissociation
  from the plasma membrane (Chandra et al, 2011; Zhang et al, 2004; Weise et al, 2012;
  Dharmaiah et al, 2016; reviewed in Schmick et al, 2015; Baehr et al, 2014). Interaction
  with PDE6D may facilitate the return of KRAS4B to the plasma membrane by promoting
  subsequent interaction with ARL2 or ARL3 (Ismail et al, 2011; Schmick et al, 2014;
  Sperlich et al, 2016). This pathway counters the tendency of KRAS4B to diffuse throughout
  the extensive endomembrane system of the cell, in a manner analogous to the dynamic
  palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle for NRAS and HRAS (Dekker et al, 2010; Rocks
  et al, 2010; Schmick et al, 2014; reviewed in Schmick et al, 2015).
