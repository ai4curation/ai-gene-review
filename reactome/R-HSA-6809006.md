display_name: Vesicle is tethered through binding GOLGA2:GORASP1, GOLGB1 and the COG
  complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Vesicles tethering at the cis-Golgi is mediated both by long coiled-coil
  tethers and by large multisubunit complexes. Vesicle-bound USO1 homodimers associate
  with the Golgi localized GOLGA2:GORASP1 complex and with the Golgi-localized octameric
  COG tethering complex (Allan et al, 2000; Moyer et al, 2001; Weide et al, 2001;
  Nakamura et al, 1997; Seeman et al, 2000; Sohda et al, 2007).  GOLGB1 is another
  Golgi localized tether that may facilitate vesicle tethering at the cis-Golgi, although
  it is also implicated in intra-Golgi retrograde trafficking (Linstedt and Hauri,
  1993;  Sonnichsen et al, 1998; Alvarez et al, 2001; Beard et al, 2005; reviewed
  in Appenzeller-Herzog et al, 2006). In addition to binding to USO1, the COG complex
  also interacts with components of the COPI coat, as well as with SNARE proteins
  and the TMEM115 protein (Suvorova et al, 2002; Zolov et al, 2005; Shestakova et
  al, 2007; Ong et al, 2014; reviewed in Willet et al, 2013).
