display_name: Casein kinase II phosphorylates STARD10
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PCTP-like protein (STARD10) is a member of the steroidogenic acute regulatory
  (StAR) protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain proteins that are implicated
  in lipid transport, metabolism, and signaling. STARD10 is thought to function as
  a dual specificity lipid transfer protein capable of shuttling phosphatidylcholine
  and phosphatidylethanolamine between membranes. Its lipid transfer activity is negatively
  regulated by casein kinase, a serine/threonine-protein kinase which phosphorylates
  STARD10 on a serine residue at position 284 (Olayioye  et al. 2007).
