summary: 'The interaction between Vif and the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Cullin5,
  Elongin B and Elongin C, and Rbx1) takes place through direct binding of the SOCS
  box motif in the viral protein Vif to the host protein Elongin C.  Moreover, a conserved
  HCCH motif in Vif allows binding to Cullin 5. '

## Summary

The interaction between Vif and the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Cullin5, Elongin B and Elongin C, and Rbx1) takes place through direct binding of the SOCS box motif in the viral protein Vif to the host protein Elongin C.  Moreover, a conserved HCCH motif in Vif allows binding to Cullin 5.
