display_name: activated human TAK1 phosphorylates MKK3/MKK6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Human MKK3 (MAP2K4) and MKK6 (MAP2K6) are two closely related dual-specificity
  protein kinases. Both are activated by cellular stress and inflammatory cytokines,
  and both phosphorylate and activate p38 MAP kinase at its activation site Thr-Gly-Tyr
  but do not phosphorylate or activate Erk1/2 or SAPK/JNK.<p> Activation of MKK3 and
  MKK6 occurs through phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues at the typical
  Ser-Xaa-Ala-Xaa-Thr motif in their activation loop. Residues involved into these
  protein kinases activation correspond to human sites Ser189 and Thr193 for MKK3  and
  Ser207 and Thr211 for MKK6 .
