stable_id: R-HSA-8939706
display_name: SCF(SKP2) polyubiquitinates RUNX2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The SCF(SKP2) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex polyubiquitinates RUNX2 on unknown
  lysine residues, targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation. SKP2-triggered
  RUNX2 degradation negatively regulates osteogenesis by inhibiting differentiation
  of osteoblasts (Thacker et al. 2016). This process is inhibited by glucose uptake
  in osteoblasts (Wei et al. 2015).
