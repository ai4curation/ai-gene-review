stable_id: R-HSA-2168883
display_name: Haptoglobin:Hemoglobin binds CD163
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The CD163 receptor binds the haptoglobin:hemoglobin complex (Kristiansen
  et al. 2001, Madsen et al. 2004, Nielsen et al. 2007). After binding, the CD163:haptoglobin:hemoglobin
  complex is internalized by endocytosis and is degraded in the lysosome. CD163 is
  found on the membranes of monocytes and macrophages.
