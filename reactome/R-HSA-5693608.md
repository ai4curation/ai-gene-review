display_name: Initial resection of double-strand break ends
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In order for repair of the DNA double-strand breaks to occur through homologous
  recombination or single strand annealing, the 5' ends of the break must first be
  resected to produce 3' overhanging single stranded DNA (ssDNA) that can subsequently
  invade homologous duplex DNA (e.g. in the sister chromatid) (Thompson et al. 2001,
  Kolpashchikov et al. 2001). The MRE11A component of the MRN complex possesses endonuclease
  activity (Trujillo et al. 1998, Hopfner et al. 2002) that is activated by binding
  of RBBP8 (CtIP) and BRCA1, in the presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+ ions (Sartori et al.
  2007, Yun and Hiom 2009).
