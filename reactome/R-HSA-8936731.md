species: Homo sapiens
summary: The paradoxical activation of ERK signaling downstream of kinase-dead or
  inhibited forms of BRAF appears to result from enhanced dimerization with RAF1/CRAF
  (Wan et al, 2004; Poulikakos et al, 2010; Heidorn et al, 2010; Hatzivassilliou et
  al, 2010; Freeman et al, 2013).  The propensity to dimerize may be promoted by conformational
  changes in the BRAF monomer as a result of mutation or inhibitor binding (reviewed
  in Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014; Lavoie and Therrien, 2015).<br>
