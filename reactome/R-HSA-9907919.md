display_name: Formation of the preholoproteasome
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The 20S core particle (20S CP) of 26S proteasome consists of four axially
  stacked heteroheptameric rings - two inner rings and two outer rings (reviewed in
  Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). Based on sequential siRNA-mediated knockdown of beta
  (PSMB) subunits of the inner ring in human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T (Hirano
  et al. 2008) and the isolation of human 20S CP intermediates (Hirano et al. 2008;
  Adolf et al. 2024), the incorporation of the beta-7 (PSMB4) subunit into the inner
  ring is tightly coupled with dimerization of half-mers, thus forming immature 20S
  proteasomes.
