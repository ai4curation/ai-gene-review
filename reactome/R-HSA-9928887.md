summary: <p>Cyclin A2 (CCNA2) forms a complex with Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1,
  also known as Cdc2) (Lees and Harlow 1993, Merrick et al. 2008, Joshi et al. 2009,
  Deibler and Kirschner 2010), resulting in the triggering of CDK1 catalytic activity
  (Lees and Harlow 1993). Two regions within the conserved cyclin box domain of CCNA2,
  encompassing amino acid residues 189-241 and 275-320, are involved in binding to
  CDK1 (Lees and Harlow 1993).</p><p>In human cells, it was shown that Cyclin A (CCNA)
  preferentially binds to CDK2 throughout G1 and S phases, and only starts binding
  to CDK1 after no more CDK2 is available, despite a ~10-fold greater abundance of
  CDK1 relative to CDK2 (Merrick et al. 2008). The two antibodies used in the study
  by Merrick et al. 2008 were raised against CCNA2, but it is not clear whether they
  distinguish between CCNA1 and CCNA2.
