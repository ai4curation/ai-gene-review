display_name: PTPN6 dephosphorylates JAK3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PTPN6, also known as SHP1, dephosphorylates JAK3 downstream of ALK signaling,
  leading to the inactivation and increased proteolytic degradation of JAK3 (Han et
  al, 2006 a, b; reviewed in Palmer et al, 2009; Chiarle et al, 2008). PTPN6 gene
  expression is lost in some cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) due to
  changes in promoter methylation, resulting in increased JAK3 activity in these cancers
  (Khoury et al, 2004; reviewed in Chiarle et al, 2008; Palmer et al, 2009).
