display_name: Plasma membrane resorption
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In differentiating keratinocytes, fusion of lamellar body (LB) membranes
  with the plasma membrane enriches the plasma membrane with lipids including omega-OH-ceramides.
  Their fatty acid chains are long enough to span the lipid bilayer, so that the omega-OH
  projects into the cell. In vitro data have shown that the membrane-anchored transglutaminase
  1 enzyme can covalently esterify these ceramides onto glutamine residues of cornified
  envelope scaffold proteins (Nemes et al. 1999). Eventually, the ceramides replace
  the bilayer plasma membrane and are thought to serve to interdigitate with and organize
  the extracellular lipids into characteristic lamellae (Kalinin et al. 2001).
