display_name: CASTOR1 homodimer binds L-arginine and dissociates from GATOR2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The CASTOR1 homodimer interacts with the GATOR2 complex via the MIOS subunit
  of GATOR2 (Chantranupong et al. 2016, Gai et al. 2016). The ACT domains of CASTOR1
  bind L-arginine (Chantranupong et al. 2016, Saxton et al. 2016, Xia et al. 2016,
  Gai et al. 2016) and CASTOR1:arginine dissociates from GATOR2, which then prevents
  GATOR1 from activating the GTPase of RRAGA,B (Chantranupong et al. 2016). GATOR1
  is recruited to the lysosomal membrane by the KICSTOR complex (Wolfson et al. 2017).

## Summary

The ACT domains of CASTOR1 bind L-arginine (Chantranupong et al. 2016, Saxton et al. 2016, Xia et al. 2016, Gai et al. 2016) and CASTOR1:arginine dissociates from GATOR2, which then prevents GATOR1 from activating the GTPase of RRAGA,B (Chantranupong et al. 2016).
