species: Homo sapiens
summary: The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF3R, GCSFR, CD114)
  is a cell-surface receptor for the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF3,
  GCSF) (Fukunaga et al. 1990, Larsen et al. 1990). CSF3R is constitutively associated
  with the kinases LYN (Corey et al. 1994) and JAK1 (Nicholson et al. 1994) and is
  present on precursor cells in the bone marrow. CSF3 initiates cell proliferation
  and differentiation into mature neutrophilic granulocytes and macrophages.<br>CSF3
  exists as a dimer. Only the dimer of CSF3R exhibits high affinity binding to CSF3
  (Hiraoka et al. 1994). CSF3R ligand-binding causes dimerization of the receptor
  (Aritomi et al. 1999, Tamada et al. 2006, Layton and Hall 2006) and signal transduction
  through JAK-STAT, RAS-RAF-ERK1,2, and PI3K.
