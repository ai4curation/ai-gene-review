display_name: IER3 recruits MAPKs to PP2A-B56-beta,gamma
species: Homo sapiens
summary: IER3 (IEX-1) recruits both an activated MAPK (MAPK1 (ERK2) or MAPK3 (ERK1))
  and the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex containing regulatory subunits B56-beta
  (PPP2R5B) or B56-gamma (PPP2R5C), through an interaction with the B56 subunit, forming
  a tripartite complex (Letourneux et al. 2006, Rocher et al. 2007).
