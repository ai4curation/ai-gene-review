display_name: '3'' PPT-primed initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis '
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HIV-1 genomic RNA contains a centrally located PPT (cPPT) within the pol
  gene that, like 3'PPT, is spared by RNase H during minus-strand DNA synthesis and
  persists to prime plus-strand DNA synthesis. This ribonucleotide primes the synthesis
  of a plus-strand DNA extending through the U3 and R regions of the HIV sequence
  and terminating in the PBS region (the tRNA primer-binding site). This DNA segment
  is known as plus-strand strong-stop DNA (+sssDNA) (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997; Pullen
  et al. 1993; Huber and Richardson 1990). cPPT priming is important for efficient
  viral replication (Alizon et al. 1992; Rausch and Le Grice 2004). Several features
  of cPPT priming in vivo remain to be clarified.
