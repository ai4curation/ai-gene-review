display_name: Regulation of IFNA/IFNB signaling
species: Homo sapiens
summary: There are several proteins and mechanisms involved in controlling the extent
  of ligand stimulation of IFNA/B signaling. These mechanisms can effect every step
  of the IFNA/B cascade. Dephosphorylation of JAK and STAT by SHP protein phosphatases,
  inhibition of STAT function in the nucleus by protein inhibitors of activated STATs
  (PIAS) proteins, inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity of JAKs by SOCS as well
  as inhibition of JAK and IFNAR2 interaction by UBP43 are few of the negative regulation
  mechanisms in controling type I IFN signaling.
