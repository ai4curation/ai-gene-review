species: Homo sapiens
summary: The interaction between talin and integrin alphaIIb beta3 breaks the putative
  salt bridge between the alphaIIb (R995) and beta3 (D723) integrin chains and induces
  conformational changes in their external domains increasing their affinity for fibrinogen
  and other ECM ligands. Breaking of this salt bridge is necessary but not sufficient
  for full activation.<br>The Talin F3 subdomain of the FERM domain has a phosphotyrosine
  binding (PTB) domain fold. This domain interacts with the membrane-proximal (MP)
  region within the integrin beta3 chain. The primary function of this interaction
  is to provide an initial strong linkage between talin and integrin and this interaction
  holds the key to the molecular recognition required for activation. In platelets
  SRC kinase and its negative regulator CSK associates constitutively with integrin
  alphaIIbbeta3. SRC is involved in alphaIIbbeta3 dependent activation of SYK, and
  both SRC and SYK are required to initiate cytoskeletal events responsible for platelet
  spreading on fibrinogen.
