stable_id: R-HSA-74740
display_name: Binding of SHC1 to insulin receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SHC1 interacts via its SH2 domain with the carboxyterminal phosphorylated
  tyrosines of the insulin receptor. As a result, SHC1 is tyrosine phosphorylated
  by the insulin receptor, later falling away from the receptor (Liang et al.1999,
  Sasaoka et al.1996).
