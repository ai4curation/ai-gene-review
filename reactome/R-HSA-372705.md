display_name: Recruitment of BCAR1 to PTK2 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BCAR1 (breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance protein1, also known as Crk-associated
  substrate (Cas) or p130Cas) is an adaptor protein that promotes protein-protein
  interactions, leading to the multiprotein complexes. The interaction of ?BCAR1/p130Cas
  with other proteins modulates cell motility, survial and proliferation. BCAR1/P130Cas
  is one of the main phosphorylation targets of the PTK2/SRC complex. The BCAR1 SH3
  domain binds to PR1 and PR2 (‘PxxP’) domains in the PTK2 C-terminal domain.
