stable_id: R-HSA-9036077
display_name: Defective HYAL1 does not hydrolyse (HA)50
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the acidic environment of the lysosome, hyaluronidase 1 (HYAL1) is able
  to hydrolyse large 20kDa HA fragments (approximately 50 disaccharide units) to 800
  Da fragments (2 disaccharide units). Defects in HYAL1 (MIM:607071) cause mucopolysaccharidosis
  type IX (MPS IX, Natowicz syndrome, Hyaluronidase deficiency, MIM:601492), a rare
  lysosomal storage disease. Triggs-Raine et al. identified a patient with two mutations
  in HYAL1 alleles, a nonconservative amino acid substitution (Glu268Lys, that is
  HYAL1 E268K) and a complex intragenic rearrangement (1361del37ins14, that is HYAL1
  V251Ffs*20) that results in a premature termination codon (Triggs-Raine et al. 1999).
