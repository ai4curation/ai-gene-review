stable_id: R-HSA-6798749
display_name: Exocytosis of specific granule lumen proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Secondary (specific) granules are peroxidase-negative and rich in antimicrobial
  substances (Joiner et al. 1989, Rorvig et al. 2012). They are more irregular and
  elongated in form than azurophil granules (Bainton et al. 1971). This might reflect
  volume adjustment in azurophil granules, which are known to proteolytically process
  a significant fraction of the proteins that are targeted to them, while little or
  no processing and therefore no increase in osmotic activity due to proteolysis has
  been observed in secondary granules (Borregaard & Cowland 1997). Secondary and tertiary
  granules have overlapping contents but can be discriminated by their intrinsic buoyant
  densities when centrifuged on gradient media (Kjeldsen et al. 1994).
