display_name: Separation of sister chromatids
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The cleavage of RAD21 subunit of centromeric cohesin by ESPL1 (separin i.e.
  separase) promotes dissociation of cohesin complexes from centromeric chromatin
  at the onset of anaphase, allowing for sister chromatid separation and segregation
  of replicated chromosomes to daughter cells (Waizenegger et al. 2000, Hauf et al.
  2001, Waizenegger et al. 2002).
