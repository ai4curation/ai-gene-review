stable_id: R-MMU-9943422
display_name: Stat4 binds the Tbx21 (T-bet) gene
species: Mus musculus
summary: Stat4 binds to the enhancer and intron of the Tbx21 gene. Stat4 binding requires
  the presence of Il12, which signals via Il12rb1:Il12rb2 and results in phosphorylated
  Stat4 dimers (Schulz et al. 2009, Wei et al. 2010, Zhu et al. 2012, Fang et al.
  2022).
