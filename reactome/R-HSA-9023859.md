stable_id: R-HSA-9023859
display_name: Estrogen-responsive TFF1 gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Estrogen-dependent TFF1 expression is promoted by the formation of FOXA1-
  and GATA3-dependent chromatin loops.  (Laganière et al, 2005; Theodorou et al, 2013;
  reviewed in Zaret and Carroll, 2011).Interaction of ligand-bound ESR1 with the enhancer
  promotes recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and methyltransferases, which
  establish transcriptionally active chromatin structures and facilitate recruitment
  of RNA polymerase II (Métivier et al, 2003; reviewed in Xu et al, 2003, Arnal et
  al, 2017).
