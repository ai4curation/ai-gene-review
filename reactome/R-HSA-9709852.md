  compartments (reviewed in Fan ACY & Young JC et al. 2011; Sokol AM et al. 2014;
  Kreimendahl S & Rassow J 2020). The molecular chaperone complexes of heat shock
  protein 90 kDa (HSP90) and HSP70 were shown to deliver precursor proteins to TOMM70
  for subsequent import (Young JC et al. 2003; Zanphorlin LM et al. 2016). Mitochondrial

  1 (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to mitochondria leading to the

  BAX translocated to the mitochondrial outer membrane and induced apoptosis in the
