display_name: Alpha-defensin dimers adsorb onto microbial membrane anionic phospholipids
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The alpha-defensin dimers adsorb onto microbial membrane anionic phospholipids,
  represented here as a complex of alpha-defensin dimers and a representative set
  of phospholipid molecules 'membrane anionic phospholipids'. The polar topology of
  defensins, with their spatially separated charged and hydrophobic regions, allows
  them to insert into microbial cell membranes, which contains more negatively charged
  phospholipids than mammalian cell membranes (Lohner et al. 1997). Defensins permeabilize
  membrane vesicles (Lehrer et al. 1989) with a greater effect on vesicles rich in
  negatively charged phospholipids (Fuji et al. 1993, Wimley et al. 1994).
