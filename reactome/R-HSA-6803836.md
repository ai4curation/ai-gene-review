stable_id: R-HSA-6803836
display_name: FGFR2b-specific alternative splicing produces FGFR2b transcript
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In epithelial cells, FGFR2 IIIb-specific alternative splicing is favoured
  by the binding of ESRP1 and 2, RBFOX2, TIA1 and TIAL1 to the nascent transcript.  These
  proteins, in conjunction with other splicing factors, activate exon IIIb-specific
  splicing and repress exon IIIc-specific splicing (Warzecha et al, 2009; Baraniak
  et al, 2006; Mauger et al, 2008; Hovhannisyan and Carstens, 2007; Del Gatto et al,
  2000).
