species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1, CDC2), as subunit of a complex with Cyclin
  B, regulates and promotes multiple transitions in the cell cycle. Protein kinase
  R (PKR, EIF2AK2) phosphorylates CDK1 at Y4, marking it for subsequent ubiquitination
  and proteosomal degradation, leading to G2/M arrest and apoptosis, in particular
  under genotoxic conditions in cancer therapy, and as part of the antiviral response
  (Dagon et al, 2001; Yoon et al, 2010).

Protein kinase R (PKR, EIF2AK2) phosphorylates CDK1 at Y4, marking it for subsequent ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation, leading to G2/M arrest and apoptosis, in particular under genotoxic conditions in cancer therapy, and as part of the antiviral response (Dagon et al, 2001; Yoon et al, 2010).
