display_name: Activated FGFR1 mutants and fusions bind PLCG1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Although it has not been rigourously established, there is some evidence
  that PLC-gamma signaling may be activated after autophosphorylation of some FGFR
  mutants, analagous to the wild type receptor (see for instance, Hart, 2000; Chen,
  2005; Cha, 2008; di Martino, 2009; Gartside, 2009; Cross, 2000; Hatch, 2006).  The
  extent to which each of the mutants activates this pathway and to which proliferation
  and tumorigenesis relies on PLC-gamma dependent signaling, remains to be more firmly
  established. FGFR1 fusions with ZMYM2, BCR, FGFR1OP and TRIM24 all result in recruitment
  and phosphorylation of PLCgamma, and where mutational studies have been performed,
  mutation of the PLCgamma binding site Y766 has been shown to abrogate this signaling
  (Guasch, 2001; Roumiantsev, 2004, Lelievre, 2008, Chase, 2007).  In the case of
  BCR-FGFR1 and ZMYM2-FGFR1, mutation of the PLCgamma binding site significantly decreased
  the transformative phenotype of the FGFR1 fusion (Roumiantsev, 2004).
