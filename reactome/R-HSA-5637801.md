display_name: Conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 by PI3K bound to phosphorylated EGFRvIII
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The kinase activity of PI3K mediates the phosphorylation of PIP2 to form
  PIP3. It is assumed that EGFRvIII cancer mutant induces PI3K/AKT signaling in a
  manner similar to wild-type EGFR. Accordingly, activation of PI3K/AKT signaling
  cascade has been demonstrated in cells expressing EGFRvIII (Lammering et al. 2003,
  Li et al. 2004)
