display_name: RNA Pol II initiates transcription from damaged DNA template
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once the transcription is initiated from a DNA template that contains an
  RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) promoter, RNA Pol II synthesizes mRNA in the presence
  of the elongation complex TFIIH until the damaged DNA base(s) is reached (Brueckner
  et al. 2007).

## Summary

Once the transcription is initiated from a DNA template that contains an RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) promoter, RNA Pol II synthesizes mRNA in the presence of the elongation complex TFIIH until the damaged DNA base(s) is reached (Brueckner et al. 2007).
