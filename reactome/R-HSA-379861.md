stable_id: R-HSA-379861
display_name: glutamate + tRNA(Glu) + ATP => Glu-tRNA(Glu) + AMP + pyrophosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Multifunctional EPRS (cytosolic glutamyl prolyl tRNA synthetase) catalyzes
  the reaction of glutamate, tRNA(Glu), and ATP to form Glu tRNA(Glu), AMP, and pyrophosphate.
  The same enzyme also catalyzes the charging of tRNA(Pro) with proline. The enzyme
  is found in the cell as a component of the mutienzyme aminoacyl tRNA synthetase
  complex (Kaiser et al. 1994).
