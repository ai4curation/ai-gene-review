stable_id: R-HSA-2467798
display_name: PTTG1 (Securin) sequesters ESPL1 (Separase)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Up to anaphase onset, ESPL1 (separase i.e. separin) forms a complex with
  PTTG1 (pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1) i.e. securin. PTTG1 sequesters ESPL1
  and block its catalytic site, preventing it from cleaving centromeric cohesin and
  causing premature separation of sister chromatids (Zou et al. 1999, Waizenegger
  et al. 2001, Waizenegger et al. 2002). PTTG1 is overexpressed in cancer and acts
  as an oncogene (Zhang et al. 1999). Regulation of PTTG1 cellular level is important
  for chromosomal stability in human cells (Jallepalli et al. 2001).
