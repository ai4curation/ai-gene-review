stable_id: R-HSA-9796071
display_name: NFE2L2 dependent NOTCH1 expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NFE2L2 appears to directly affect Notch1 expression in MEFs and this is likely
  mediated by the binding of NFE2L2 to a regulatory domain(s) in the −1640 proximal
  promoter of NOTCH1. NOTCH1 plays role in tissue regeneration and hematopoietic reconstitution
  following myelosuppressive radiation (Wakabayashi et al, 2010; Kim et al, 2014).
