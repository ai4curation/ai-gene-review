summary: Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase,
  which plays an essential role in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling (Brunner C et al.
  2005). BTK has been also implicated in TLR signaling (Lee KG et al. 2012, Jefferies
  CA et al. 2003; Doyle SL et al. 2007). Interaction studies revealed that BTK can
  associate with intracellular TIR-domains of TLRs 4, 6, 8 and 9. Furthermore, BTK
  was found to interact with other proteins involved in TLR2/4 signaling - MyD88,
  MAL and IRAK-1 (Jefferies CA et al. 2003)<p>Loss of BTK function causes X-linked
  agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a rare primary immunode?ciency disease with severe defects
  in early B-cell development resulting in an almost complete absence of peripheral
  B cells and severely reduced serum levels of immunoglobulins of all classes (Väliaho
  J et al. 2006). Affected individuals suffer from recurrent bacterial and enteroviral
  infections. It remains unclear whether XLA patients have normal or impared TLR signaling
  functions. LPS-stimulated monocytes from XLA patients were found to produce reduced
  amounts of TNFalpha (Horwood NJ et al. 2003), These data contradict a study that
  showed enhanced amounts of TNFalpha and IL6  comparing to control cells, starting
  at 6 hours and extending for 48 hours (Marron TU et al. 2012). The other group reported
  similar expression TNFalpha upon TLR4 triggering, compared with healthy control
  cells (Perez de Diego R et al. 2006). Thus, the effect of BTK deficiency on TLR-mediated
  inflammation needs to be further clarified.
