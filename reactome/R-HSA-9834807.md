stable_id: R-HSA-9834807
display_name: ILF3 binds PKR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon viral infection, interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (also known as
  NF90, NFAR, DRBP76, MBP4, or ILF3) accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it binds
  to and activates EIF2AK2 (PKR). Since activated PKR phosphorylates ILF3, resulting
  in dissociation of ILF3 from its complex with NF45, both processes appear to be
  part of a feedback loop that enhances PKR signaling (Patel et al, 1999; Parker et
  al, 2001; Harashima et al, 2010; Wen et al, 2014; Li et al, 2016).
