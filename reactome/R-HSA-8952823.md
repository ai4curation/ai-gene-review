species: Homo sapiens
summary: Activated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) and

  heterodimeric receptor (Parham et al. 2002, Silvanesan et al. 2016). <br>This is
  a Black box event since the exact mechanisms of STAT3 and STAT4 binding, phosphorylation,
  dissociation and dimerization are unknown.
