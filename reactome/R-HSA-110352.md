display_name: Displacement of NTHL1 glycosylase by APEX1 at the AP site
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'APEX1 (APE1, HAP1), a DNA apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site lyase, displaces
  NTHL1 (hNTH1) from the AP site generated by the NTHL1 DNA glycosylase activity.
  Current data indicate that while the NTHL1 DNA lyase activity is blocked at most
  NTHL1-bound AP sites, it can act on the AP site generated by the thymine glycol
  cleavage (Marenstein et al. 2003). '

## Summary

APEX1 (APE1, HAP1), a DNA apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site lyase, displaces NTHL1 (hNTH1) from the AP site generated by the NTHL1 DNA glycosylase activity. Current data indicate that while the NTHL1 DNA lyase activity is blocked at most NTHL1-bound AP sites, it can act on the AP site generated by the thymine glycol cleavage (Marenstein et al. 2003).
