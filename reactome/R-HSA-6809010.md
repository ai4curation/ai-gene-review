display_name: COPI vesicle uncoating
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The mechanisms of COPI vesicle uncoating are not well established (reviewed
  in Szul and Sztul, 2011).  Coat dissociation may be promoted by changes in protein-protein
  interactions upon vesicle tethering, as has been suggested for retrograde COPI-traffic
  to the ER (Zink et al, 2009). After uncoating and membrane fusion, the SNARE complex
  exists as a four-helix bundle that must be "unzipped" (dissociated) by NSF for reuse,
  an energetically costly event (reviewed in Hong and Lev, 2014; Sudhof and Rothman,
  2009).
