summary: STAT3 is a key regulator of transcriptional events downstream of oncogenic
  forms of ALK, including NPM-ALK (reviewed in Turner and Alexander, 2006; Chiarle
  et al, 2008; Ducray et al, 2019).  <br>STAT3 is phosphorylated at tyrosine 705 downstream
  of active ALK and oncogenic ALK fusion proteins and contributes to cellular survival.
  Tyrosine phosphorylation at residue 705 is required for STAT3 dimerization, nuclear
  translocation, and DNA binding (Zamo et al, 2002; Zhang et al, 2002; Amin et al,
  2003; Chiarle et al, 2003; Chiarle et al, 2005; reviewed in Chiarle et al, 2008;

  is controversial (Zhang et al, 2002; Han et al 2006 a,b; Lai et al, 2005; Marzec
  et al. 2005; Shi et al, 2006; reviewed in Palmer et al, 2009).  STAT3 supports cell
  survival by promoting the expression of a number of cell cycle and anti-apoptotic
  genes (reviewed in Chiarle et al, 2008; Ducray et al, 2019).
