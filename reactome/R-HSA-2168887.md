display_name: Ferriheme is transferred from Albumin to Hemopexin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Despite the lower affinity of ferriheme for albumin than for hemopexin, ferriheme
  initially associates with albumin, presumably because the molar concentration of
  albumin in plasma is considerably greater than that of hemopexin. Ferriheme is transferred
  directly from serum albumin to hemopexin (Morgan et al. 1976, Pasternack et al.
  1983, Pasternack et al. 1985).

## Summary

Despite the lower affinity of ferriheme for albumin than for hemopexin, ferriheme initially associates with albumin, presumably because the molar concentration of albumin in plasma is considerably greater than that of hemopexin. Ferriheme is transferred directly from serum albumin to hemopexin (Morgan et al. 1976, Pasternack et al. 1983, Pasternack et al. 1985).
