display_name: RAB3 GEFs exchange GTP for GDP on RAB3A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAB3A is involved in neurotransmitter release at the synaptic vesicle (Fischer
  et al, 1991; Holz et al, 1994; Geppert et al, 1994; Kapfhamer et al, 2002; reviewed
  in Pavlos and Jahn, 2011). RAB3A is activated at the synaptic vesicle through the
  guanine nucleotide exchange activity of RAB3IL1 (also known as GRAB) which promotes
  the exchange of GDP for GTP (Luo et al, 2001; Yoshimura et al, 2010). RAB3 family
  members are also activated by the DENN domain-containing GEF MADD, also known as
  RAB3GEP (Wada et al, 1997; Fukui et al, 1997; Iwasaki et al, 1997; Mahoney et al,
  2006). Interaction of RAB3A with its GEFs promotes release of GDP, allowing GTP
  to bind, and precludes the interaction of RAB3A with GDI and CHM proteins.
