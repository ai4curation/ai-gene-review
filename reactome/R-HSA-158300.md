stable_id: R-HSA-158300
display_name: factor XI:platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib:IX:V complex -> factor XIa:platelet
  glycoprotein (GP) Ib:IX:V complex (XIIa catalyst)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Factor XI, bound to the cell surface, is converted to activated factor XI
  (factor XIa). Chemically, this reaction involves the cleavage of a single peptide
  bond in each subunit of the factor XI homodimer; intra- and inter-chain disulfide
  bonds hold the resulting four polypeptides together (Bouma BN and Griffin JH 1977;
  Kurachi K and Davie EW 1977; McMullen BA et al. 1991). In the body, this reaction
  occurs on the surfaces of activated platelets, where factor IX (FIX) binds to the
  glycoprotein GPIb:IX:V receptor complex (Greengard JS et al. 1986; Baird TR and
  Walsh PN 2002; Baglia FA et al., 2004; Reitsma SE et al. 2021). When this reaction
  occurs as a step in the contact activation pathway, it is catalyzed by activated
  factor XIIa (Kurachi K and Davie EW 1977; Cheng Q et al., 2010), which is generated
  either through proteolytic cleavage by kallikrein on endothelial cell surfaces (Schmaier
  AH, 2004) or via FXII autoactivation upon binding of FXII to polyanionic surfaces,
  including platelet-released polyphosphates (Müller F et al., 2009; Engel R et al.,
  2014).
