  molecule Beta-Pix
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Beta-Pix (Cool-1) associates with CBL, which appears to be a critical step
  in CDC42-mediated inhibition of EGFR ubiquitylation and downregulation. The SH3
  domain of Beta-Pix specifically interacts with a proline-arginine motif (PxxxPR)
  present within CBL, which mediates ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of
  Beta-Pix.
