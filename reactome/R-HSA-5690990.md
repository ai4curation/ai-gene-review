display_name: 5'- incision of DNA by ERCC1:ERCC4 in GG-NER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), just like in transcription-coupled
  nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), the cleavage of the damaged strand of DNA 5'
  to the site of damage occurs at the junction of single-stranded DNA and double-stranded
  DNA that is formed when the DNA duplex is unwound. The 5' incision is carried out
  by the ERCC1:XPF (ERCC1:ERCC4) complex and precedes the 3' incision (Staresincic
  et al. 2009).
