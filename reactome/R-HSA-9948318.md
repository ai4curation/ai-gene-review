display_name: LTN1 and TCF25 bind NEMF:60S ribosomal subunit:peptidyl-tRNA with nascent
  peptide-Ala
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The N-terminal region of Listerin (LTN1), a ubiquitin E3 ligase, contacts
  NEMF bound to the peptidyl-tRNA and the 60S ribosomal subunit. The C-terminal region
  of LTN1 binds the 60S ribosomal subunit near the exit tunnel (Shao et al. 2015,
  inferred from yeast homologs in Lyumkis et al. 2014). NEMF is required for LTN1
  binding to the 60S ribosome (Shao et al. 2015). TCF25 (the human homolog of RQC1
  in yeast) interacts with LTN1 (inferred from yeast homologs in Defenouillère et
  al. 2013). After binding the 60S ribosomal subunit, LTN1 then conjugates ubiquitin
  to lysine residues of the nascent peptide that protrudes from the exit tunnel (reviewed
  in Mishra et al. 2021)
