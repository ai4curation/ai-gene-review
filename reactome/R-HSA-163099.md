display_name: Alignment Of The RNA Template On The Telomeric Chromosome End
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In vitro studies of telomerase complexes derived from multiple organisms
  indicate that at least two types of interactions are important for telomerase RNP
  catalytic site alignment at the 3' G-rich single-strand telomere end. In one interaction,
  an alignment region in hTERC base-pairs with the 3' G-rich single-strand telomeric
  DNA end to form an RNA-DNA hybrid, which positions the template adjacent to the
  3' end of the telomere. In a second interaction, a portion of hTERT is proposed
  to interact with the DNA 5' of the telomerase RNA/DNA primer hybrid (Harrington
  and Greider 1991; Morin 1991; Moriarty et al. 2005), which is important for the
  catalytic rate (Lee and Blackburn, 1993) and presumably allows telomerase to maintain
  contact with the chromosome during the translocation step. How the anchor site binding
  and template hybridization are coordinated is not known.
