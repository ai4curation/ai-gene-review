stable_id: R-HSA-2067713
display_name: GP369 inhibits activation of amplified FGFR2 signaling
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Treatment of FGFR2-amplified gastric and breast cancer cell lines with the
  antibody GP369 inhibits FGFR2 phosphorylation and downstream signaling and suppresses
  cell proliferation. Treatment of mice with GP369 inhibits the growth of  human cancer
  xenografts carrying activating FGFR2 mutations. The GP369-binding epitope is contained
  in the ligand-binding region of the receptor, suggesting that the antibody works
  by disrupting the ligand-dependent activation of amplified FGFR2 (Bai, 2010).
