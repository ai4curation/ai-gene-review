stable_id: R-HSA-3595175
display_name: Defective CHST3 does not transfer SO4(2-) to chondroitin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 (CHST3 also known as C6ST-1) catalyzes the
  transfer of sulfate (SO4(2-)) from PAPS to position 6 of the N-acetylgalactosamine
  (GalNAc) residue of chondroitin-containing proteins resulting in chondroitin sulfate
  (C6S-PG), a major component of cartilage. CHST7 (also known as C6ST-1) may also
  contribute to this activity. Defects in CHST3 result in undersulfated CS, weakening
  cartilage structures and causing spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with congenital joint
  dislocations (SEDC-JD; MIM:143095). Mutations causing SEDC-JD include R304Q, L259P,
  R222W, L307P, Y201*, E372K and L286P (Thiele et al. 2004, Hermanns et al. 2008,
  Unger et al. 2010, van Roij et al. 2008).
