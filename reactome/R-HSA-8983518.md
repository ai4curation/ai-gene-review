species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Interleukin-35 (IL35) is a heteromeric complex conformed by Interleukin-12
  subunit alpha (IL12A) and Interleukin-27 subunit alpha (IL27). IL35 can stimulate
  Janus Kinase (JAK)-bound homodimers of Interleukin-6 receptor beta precursor  (IL6ST
  or gp130). JAKs are believed to be associated with the receptor before receptor
  activation (Behrmann et al., 2004). Subsequently, this triggers the phosphorylation
  of STAT1 downstream. The physiological consequence of this signalling is the suppression
  of T-cell response. The event is represented as a black box due to the incomplete
  knowledge about the ligand binding to monomers followed by dimerization or binding
  directly to the dimers.   '
