species: Homo sapiens
summary: The C-terminal region of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MKRN1 interacts with PTEN
  and polyubiquitinates it on lysine residue K289, via K48 linkage. AKT-mediated phosphorylation
  of MKRN1 on serine residue S109 is a pre-requisite for MKRN1 stabilization and MKRN1-mediated
  ubiquitination of PTEN. MKRN1 is implicated as an oncogene in cervical cancer (Lee
  et al. 2015).
