display_name: Mtmr2 binds MTMR10
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Based on a high throughput study of human interactome in HeLa cells stably
  expressing tagged mouse Mtmr2 (97% identical to human MTMR2) under the control of
  mouse Mtmr2 promoter, Mtmr2 forms a complex with endogenous human MTMR10 (Hein et
