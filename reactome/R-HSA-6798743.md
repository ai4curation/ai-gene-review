display_name: Exocytosis of secretory granule membrane proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Secretory vesicles provide a reservoir of membrane-associated receptors that
  are required at the earliest stages of the neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response.
  They are mobilized in response to a wide variety of inflammatory stimuli (Sengelov
  et al. 1993a,b). Resultant cell surface changes allow the neutrophil to establish
  firm contact with activated vascular epithelium (Faurschou & Borregaard 2003).
