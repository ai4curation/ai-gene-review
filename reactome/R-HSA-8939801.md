species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Polyubiquitinated RUNX2 is degraded by the proteasome. As it has not been
  examined whether SCF(SKP2)-mediated polyubiquitination of RUNX2 leads to translocation
  of PolyUb-RUNX2 to the cytosol (Thacker et al. 2016), proteasome mediated degradation
  is assumed to happen in the nucleus. This process is inhibited by glucose uptake
  in osteoblasts (Wei et al. 2015). '

## Summary

Polyubiquitinated RUNX2 is degraded by the proteasome. As it has not been examined whether SCF(SKP2)-mediated polyubiquitination of RUNX2 leads to translocation of PolyUb-RUNX2 to the cytosol (Thacker et al. 2016), proteasome mediated degradation is assumed to happen in the nucleus. This process is inhibited by glucose uptake in osteoblasts (Wei et al. 2015).
