display_name: Binding of gp120 of ENV oligomer to the host CD4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CD4, located on the host cell membrane, is the main cellular receptor for
  the HIV protein gp120, which aids in mediating viral entry into target cells. The
  initial step in this cascade of events is the binding of viral gp120 protein to
  its host receptor, CD4.  The key binding sites in CD4 for interaction with gp120
  are located in the amino-terminal part of the CD4 molecule, distal to the transmembrane
  domain. The gp120 protein forms an oligomer (trimer) on the viral membrane with
  each gp120 protein containing variable domains (known as loops) and conservative
  domains. The V3 loop is also often obscured by gp120 glycosylation. Crystallization
  studies of CD4 suggest that the molecule has two immunoglobulin like domains important
  for the CD4/gp120 interaction, with one of the domains (D1) playing a more prominent
  role. Further studies suggest the Phe 43 and Arg 59 residues of CD4 play a major
  role in complex formation. Crystallization of gp120 shows that the polypeptide chain
  is folded into two major domains (an "inner" and "outer" domain with respect to
  the N and C termini), with the distal end of the “outer” domain containing the V3
  loop. Studies of CD4 complexed with gp120 show that CD4 is bound to gp120 in a depression
  which is formed at the interface between the inner and outer domains. The complex
  itself is held together through van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding.
