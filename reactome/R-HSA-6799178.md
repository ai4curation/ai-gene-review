display_name: Intermediate 1 binds HP subcomplex to form Intermediate 2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The hydrophobic protein fraction (HP) is assembled with NDUFA3, 8, 9 and
  13 amongst many others and anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane by Intermediate
  1 assembly factors NDUFAF3 (C3orf60), NDUFAF4 (C6orf66) and TIMMDC1 (C3orf1) to
  form Intermediate 2 (Mckenzie & Ryan 2010, Andrews et al. 2013). LYR motif-containing
  protein 2 (LYRM2) interacts with Complex I pre-assembly complexes via the subunit
  NDUFAB1, subunit of HP, in a transient manner. LYRM2 knockout cell lines of HEK293T
  cells showed reduced levels of a subset of complex I subunits and assembly factors
  (Dibley et al., 2019). We chose to annotate it as a requirement for this reaction,
  but the exact mechanism of LYRM2 is still unclear.
