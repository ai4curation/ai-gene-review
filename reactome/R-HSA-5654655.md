display_name: Activated FGFR4 phosphorylates PPTN11
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Tyrosine phosphorylation of PPTN11/SHP2 by FGFR kinase is required for activation
  of the phosphatase activity of PPTN11 and for downstream signaling.  Tyrosine phosphorylated
  PPTN11 plays a major role in the activation of RAS-MAP kinase pathway, although
  the precise role is not yet clear.
