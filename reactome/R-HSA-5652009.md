summary: 'The complex of RAD18, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and UBE2B (RAD6), an E2 ubiquitin
  conjugating enzyme, monoubiquitinates PCNA associated with damaged DNA on lysine
  residue K164, using the ubiquitin residue K63 to create the covalent bond (Hoege
  et al. 2002). The catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta (POLD), POLD1, does
  not bind monoubiquitinated PCNA (Park et al. 2014), implying that replicative polymerases
  POLD and POLE (DNA polymerase epsilon complex) dissociate from PCNA monubiquitinated
  at K164. This is in accordance with the proposed DNA polymerase switch during translesion
  DNA synthesis (TLS) (Friedberg et al. 2005). DNA damage induced removal of PCNA-associated
  protein KIAA0101 (PAF15) through proteasome-mediated degradation facilitates switching
  from replicative DNA polymerases POLD and POLE to TLS polymerases (Povlsen et al.
  2012).<p>The ubiquitin ligase complex RBX1:CUL4:DDB1:DTL can also monoubiquitinate
