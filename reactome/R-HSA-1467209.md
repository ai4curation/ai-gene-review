species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'In S. aureus, rather than cause gross membrane changes, HNP-1 (de Leeuw
  et al. 2010) and hBD3 (Sass et al. 2011) appear to interfere with cell wall biosynthetic
  pathways by binding to Lipid II (undecaprenylpyrophosphate-MurNAc[pentapeptide]-GlcNAc),
  an essential precursor of bacterial cell walls and the target of several antibiotics
  (Breukink & de Krujiff 2007). The transformation of monomeric lipid II into a polymeric
  peptidoglycan by the bifunctional S. aureus enzyme Penicillin-binding protein 2
  (PBP2) is inhibited by hBD3 (Sass et al. 2011) resulting in local lesions of the
  cell wall layer through which membranes and cytoplasmic contents ultimately protrude. '

## Summary

In S. aureus, rather than cause gross membrane changes, HNP-1 (de Leeuw et al. 2010) and hBD3 (Sass et al. 2011) appear to interfere with cell wall biosynthetic pathways by binding to Lipid II (undecaprenylpyrophosphate-MurNAc[pentapeptide]-GlcNAc), an essential precursor of bacterial cell walls and the target of several antibiotics (Breukink & de Krujiff 2007). The transformation of monomeric lipid II into a polymeric peptidoglycan by the bifunctional S. aureus enzyme Penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2) is inhibited by hBD3 (Sass et al. 2011) resulting in local lesions of the cell wall layer through which membranes and cytoplasmic contents ultimately protrude.
