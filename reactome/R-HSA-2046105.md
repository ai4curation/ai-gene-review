display_name: Linoleic acid (LA) metabolism
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Linoleic acid (LA, 18:2(n-6)) is an omega-6 fatty acid obtained through
  diet, mainly from vegetable oils. Omega-6 fatty acids helps stimulate skin and hair
  growth, maintain bone health, regulate metabolism, and maintain the reproductive
  system. All the desaturation and elongation steps occur in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) except for the final step which requires translocation to peroxisomes for partial
  beta-oxidation. The linoleic acid pathway involves the following steps: 18:2(n-6)-->18:3(n-6)-->
  20:3(n-6)-->20:4(n-6)-->22:4(n-6)-->24:4(n-6)-->24:5(n-6)-->22:5(n-6). Two desaturation
  enzymes are involved in this process: delta-6 desaturase which converts 18:2(n-6)
  to 18:3 (n-6) and 24:4(n-6) to 24:5(n-6) respectively, and delta-5 desaturase which
  converts 20:3(n-6) to 20:4(n-6). (Sprecher 2002).'

## Summary

Linoleic acid (LA, 18:2(n-6)) is an omega-6 fatty acid obtained through diet, mainly from vegetable oils. Omega-6 fatty acids helps stimulate skin and hair growth, maintain bone health, regulate metabolism, and maintain the reproductive system. All the desaturation and elongation steps occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) except for the final step which requires translocation to peroxisomes for partial beta-oxidation. The linoleic acid pathway involves the following steps: 18:2(n-6)-->18:3(n-6)--> 20:3(n-6)-->20:4(n-6)-->22:4(n-6)-->24:4(n-6)-->24:5(n-6)-->22:5(n-6). Two desaturation enzymes are involved in this process: delta-6 desaturase which converts 18:2(n-6) to 18:3 (n-6) and 24:4(n-6) to 24:5(n-6) respectively, and delta-5 desaturase which converts 20:3(n-6) to 20:4(n-6).
