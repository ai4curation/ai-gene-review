display_name: SHOC2 M173I disrupts the SHOC2:MRAS:PP1 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A loss-of-function mutation in SHOC2 has been identified in a patient with
  a Noonan-related syndrome (Hannig et al, 2014).  SHOC2 M173I has impaired ability
  to interact with PPP1CC and reduces the MRAS-SHOC2-PP1-dependent dephosphorylation
  of RAF, which is required for RAF pathway activation (Rodriguez-Viciano et al, 2006;
  Hannig et al, 2014). How both loss and gain-of-function SHOC2 mutants can  contribute
  to RAF pathway activation remains to be elucidated.
