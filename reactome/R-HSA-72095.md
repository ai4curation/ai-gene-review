stable_id: R-HSA-72095
display_name: Internal Methylation of mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In addition to the methylation of the 5'-cap, there is methylation of internal
  nucleotides in the mRNA. This methylation can occur in translated and untranslated
  regions. One to three methyl groups have been seen per mRNA molecule, but methylation
  is non-stoichiometric. The most frequent methylation observed is at the N6 position
  of adenosine. The function of mRNA internal methylation, if any, is unknown.
