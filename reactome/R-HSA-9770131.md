summary: DHX16 (homolog of yeast Prp2) hydrolyzes ATP in the Spliceosomal Bact complex
  to form the Spliceosomal B* complex (Gencheva et al. 2010), possibly by pulling
  the intron to dissociate the RES complex and the SF3A and SF3B subcomplexes of the
  U2 snRNP from the spliceosome (Bessonov et al. 2010, Agafonov et al. 2011, Schmidt
  et al. 2014, Kastner et al. 2019). The intron branch point now docks near the 5'
  splice site (Zhan et al. 2018), displacing RNF113A (homolog of yeast Cwc24) (Schmidt
  et al. 2014, Zhan et al. 2018). YJU2 and ISY1 bind and distort the helix of the
  branch point to fit the active site (Zhan et al. 2018). Prior to the transesterification
  reaction between the adenosine residue of the intron branch point and the 5' splice
  site, the complex is called the Spliceosomal B* complex.<br>Components of the core
  exon junction complex (EJC) comprising EIF4A3, CASC3, MAGOH, and RBM8A are recruited
  to the spliceosome around this time (Kataoka and Dreyfuss 2004) by an interaction
  between CWC22 and EIF4A3 (Reichert et al. 2002, Alexandrov et al. 2012, Barbosa
  et al. 2012, Steckelberg et al. 2012, Busetto et al. 2020), though they may not
  yet bind RNA. CWC27 must be displaced in order for RBM8A (Y14) to bind (Busetto
  et al. 2020). Due to the position of CWC22 in the spliceosome, the EJC will be deposited
  on the 5' exon about 20-24 nucleotides upstream of the 5' splice site. The components
  and formation of the spliceosomal B* complex are partly inferred from the composition
  of the spliceosomal C complex (Jurica et al. 2002, Makarov et al. 2002, Rappsilber

## Summary

DHX16 (homolog of yeast Prp2) hydrolyzes ATP in the Spliceosomal Bact complex to form the Spliceosomal B* complex (Gencheva et al. 2010), possibly by pulling the intron to dissociate the RES complex and the SF3A and SF3B subcomplexes of the U2 snRNP from the spliceosome (Bessonov et al. 2010, Agafonov et al. 2011, Schmidt et al. 2014, Kastner et al. 2019). The intron branch point now docks near the 5' splice site (Zhan et al. 2018), displacing RNF113A (homolog of yeast Cwc24) (Schmidt et al. 2014, Zhan et al. 2018). YJU2 and ISY1 bind and distort the helix of the branch point to fit the active site (Zhan et al. 2018).
