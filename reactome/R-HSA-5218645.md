display_name: SRC-1 binds p-Y397-PTK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Autophosphorylation of  Y397 on FAK1 provides a high affinity binding site
  for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Src family kinases (SFKs) allowing their
  recruitment, activation and subsequent transphosphorylation of FAK1 at additional
  sites (Calalb et al. 1995).
