display_name: Opioid dissociates from MOR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Different ligands of the MOR receptor can promote MOR phosphorylation, uncoupling,
  endocytosis or inactivation. For example, the endogenous peptide ligands at the
  MOR induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and rapid receptor recycling. By contrast,
  morphine induces little to no endocytosis, tolerance and dependence. The agonist-dependent
  phosphorylation of opioid receptors changes the receptor conformation and increases
  the affinity of the receptors for cytosolic beta-arrestin proteins. This results
  in an uncoupling of G protein signalling and recruitment of the endocytotic machinery
  leading to receptor internalization and rapid resensitization. By contrast, PKC
  phosphorylation by non internalizing opioid ligands (e.g., morphine) cause receptors
  to remain inactivated in the plasma membrane, leading to signaling desensitization
  and opioid tolerance. In this case receptors appear to require activity of a phosphatase
  to be resensitized.
