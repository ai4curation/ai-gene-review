stable_id: R-HSA-8871506
display_name: SORL1 transports APP(18-770) from endosome lumen to Golgi lumen
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) is expressed mainly in brain, where
  it is most abundant in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex and the occipital pole. It
  acts as a sorting receptor that mediates anterograde and retrograde movement of
  APP between the trans-Golgi network and early endosomes, thereby restricting delivery
  of the APP precursor to endocytic compartments that favour amyloidogenic peptide
  production (Andersen et al. 2005, Willnow & Andersen 2013, Yin et al. 2015, Hermey
  2015). Targeting SORL1 might present novel opportunities for Alzheimer's disease
  therapy.
