species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation by PKA primes GLI3 for subsequent phosphorylation by CK1
  at four or more sites.  These serial phosphorylations are required for the recruitment
  of beta-TrCP and subsequent ubiquitination and processing of GLI3 (Tempe et al,
  2006; Wang and Li, 2006; Wen et al, 2010; Schrader et al, 2011)
