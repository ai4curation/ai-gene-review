display_name: VEGFA,B,PLGF bind to VEGFR1 leading to receptor dimerization
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'VEGFR-1 binds VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PLGF homodimers. This interaction is required
  for normal angiogenesis and hematopoiesis, although many of the detailed molecular
  steps from binding to these physiological consequences remain unclear (Hickins and
  Ellis, 2005). VEGFR-1 is made up of 1338 aa and has three regions: an extracellular
  region consisting of 7 immunoglobin-like domains, a transmembrane (TM) domain and
  a cytosolic tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. An alternatively spliced form, soluble
  VEGFR-1 (sVEGFR1), also binds VEGF proteins and may serve in the body to down-regulate
  VEGF activation of membrane-bound receptors. Overexpression of sVEGFR1 (VEGF121)
  is associated with  preeclampsia, a major disorder of pregnancy (Shibuya and Claesson-Welsh
  2006; Levine et al. 2004).'
