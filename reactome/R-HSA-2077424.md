display_name: Point mutants of FGFR2 bind and are inactivated by tyrosine kinase inhibitors
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FGFR2 is inhibited by a range of in vitro tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including
  PD170734 and SU5402 (reviewed in Greulich and Pollock, 2010; Wesche, 2011).  In
  addition, there are a number of FGFR2 inhibitors currently in clinical trials that
  for treatment of solid malignancies (http://ClinicalTrials.gov).
