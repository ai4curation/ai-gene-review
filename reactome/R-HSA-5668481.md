species: Homo sapiens
summary: K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 further leads to its proteasome-dependent
  degradation. The resultant degradation of TRAF3 releases NIK from the cIAPs ubiquitin-ligase
  complex. NIK can escape from ubiquitination and subsequent degradation resulting
  in accumulation in the cytosol (Sas et al. 2012).
