display_name: Phosphorylated MAPKs translocate into the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After phosphorylation by MAP2Ks, a proportion of activated MAPK translocates
  into the nucleus where it activates nuclear targets (reviewed in Roskoski, 2012b).  MAPKs,
  which lack a nuclear localization signal (NLS), may 'piggyback' into the nucleus
  in complex with other nuclear-targeted proteins or may translocate by virtue of
  interaction with components of the nuclear pore complex (Brunet et al, 1999; Adachi
  et al, 1999; Matsubayashi et al, 2001; Whitehurst et al, 2002; Khokhlatchev et al,
  1998; reviewed in Roskoski, 2012b).  Although dimerization of MAPKs was thought
  to be critical for nuclear translocation, a number of studies have now challenged
  the physiological relevance of MAPK dimerization and this remains an area of uncertainty
  (Lenormand et al, 1993; Chen et al, 1992; Casar et al, 2008; Lidke et al, 2010;

## Summary
