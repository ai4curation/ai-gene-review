stable_id: R-HSA-9925087
display_name: CD274 mRNA binds miR-138-5p RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA 138 5p (miR-429-5p) plays a role in immune checkpoint regulation
  by regulating PDL1 expression. It is a tumor suppressor and its expression is downregulated
  in multiple cancers (Zhao et al., 2016, Yang et al., 2016). miR- 429-5p suppresses
  CD274 (PD-L1) expression by directly binding to 3’ UTR of the PDL1 mRNA and inhibiting
  its translation, reported through luciferase reporter assays (Rostami et al., 2024,
  Zhao et al., 2016)
