display_name: Mouse FGFR2 IIIa TM binds FGF1,2 and full-length receptors
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mouse FGFT2 IIIa TM has been shown to bind to FGFR2b and c in the presence
  of FGF1 in vitro, and to inhibit signaling in vivo and in cell culture in an FGF2-dependent
  manner.  Inhibition of FGFR signaling may arise as a result of ligand sequestration
  and/or through the formation of non-functional heterodimers with full-length receptors
  (Wheldon et al, 2011).

## Summary

Inhibition of FGFR signaling may arise as a result of ligand sequestration and/or through the formation of non-functional heterodimers with full-length receptors (Wheldon et al, 2011).
