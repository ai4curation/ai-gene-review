stable_id: R-HSA-6783492
display_name: TRMT6:TRMT61A methylate adenosine yielding 1-methyladenosine at nucleotide
  58 of tRNA(Met)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The TRMT6:TRMT61A complex transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine
  to the 1 position of adenosine-58 of tRNA(Met) (Ozanick et al. 2005). Based on the
  location of the homologous complex (GCD10:GCD14) in yeast (Anderson et al. 1998),
  methylation by the TRMT6:TRMT61A complex is inferred to occur in the nucleus.
