# 2-acyl LPG is acylated to PG by LPGAT
**Reactome ID:** [R-HSA-1482635](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-1482635)
**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

At the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, lysophospholipid acyltransferases acylate 2-acyl lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) to form phosphatidylglycerol (PG).  The lysophospholipid acyltransferases involved are: lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) (Nakanishi et al. 2006, Chen et al. 2006), lysophospholipid acyltransferase LPCAT4 (LPCAT4) aka LPEAT2 (Cao et al. 2008, Ye et al. 2005); or acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase (LPGAT1) (Yang et al. 2004).
