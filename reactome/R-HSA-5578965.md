display_name: TNRC6A binds AGO2:miRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TNRC6A (GW182) is a major component of miRISC and processing bodies (P bodies
  or GW bodies) where transcripts are degraded (Eystathioy et al. 2003). GW182 posesses
  several glycine-tryptophan (GW) repeats that enable interactions with Argonaute
  proteins (Eulalio et al. 2009, Takimoto et al. 2009). Humans express three paralogs
  (TNRC6A, TNRC6B, and TNRC6C) which can each silence expression of mRNAs to which
  they are bound (Lazzaretti et al. 2009). In the cytosol TNRC6A binds AGO2:miRNA
  via three GW-repeat motifs (Landthaler et al. 2008, Takimoto et al. 2009, Nishi
  et al. 2013).
