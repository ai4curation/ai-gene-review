species: Homo sapiens
summary: ARFRP1 regulates Golgi localization of ARL1, another ARF-like GTPase that
  itself recruits a number of Golgin-tethering factors to the TGN.  Knockout strains
  of ARL3, the yeast homologue of ARFRP1, abrogates Golgi localization of both yeast
  Arl1p and the four yeast Golgin homologues, suggesting a cascade of ARL proteins
  is contributes to retrograde trafficking at the TGN (Setty et al, 2003; Setty et
  al, 2004; Behnia et al, 2004; Panic et al, 2003; reviewed in Munro, 2005; Bonafacino
  and Rojas, 2006). GEF and GAP proteins that regulate ARFRP1 and ARL1 activity have
  not yet been identified (reviewed in Munro, 2005).
