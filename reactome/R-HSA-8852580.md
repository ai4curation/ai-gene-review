stable_id: R-HSA-8852580
display_name: Clusterin binds C5b-C7, C8, C9
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Clusterin is a dimer of two fragments of the same translation product, which
  are disulfide bonded by five cysteines on each peptide (Tobe et al. 1991). It is
  able to modulate the terminal complement cascade in vitro and prevent cellular lysis
  by the membrane attack complex (MAC), C5b-9. Clusterin forms complexes with C5b:C6:C7,
  or C5b:C6:C7:C8 or C5b:C6:C7:C8:C9, as the proteins assemble into the amphiphilic
  MAC. Clusterin binding renders the complexes soluble and lytically inactive (Jenne
  & Tschopp 1989, Choi et al. 1989, Murphy et al. 1989, Tschopp et al. 1993).
