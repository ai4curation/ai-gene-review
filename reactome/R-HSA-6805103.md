stable_id: R-HSA-6805103
display_name: AURKA phosphorylates TP53
species: Homo sapiens
summary: AURKA (Aurora kinase A) phosphorylates TP53 (p53) on serine residue S315.
  This leads to destabilization of TP53 by enhancing MDM2 binding (Katayama et al.
  2004). Based on Xenopus studies, AURKA-mediated phosphorylation of TP53 occurs in
  the presence of AURKA activator TPX2 (Pascreau et al. 2009).
