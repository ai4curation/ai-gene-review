species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation of TSC2 by AKT enables association of TSC2 with 14-3-3 proteins
  YWHAB (14-3-3 protein beta/alpha), YWHAQ (14-3-3 protein theta), YWHAG (14-3-3 protein
  gamma), YWHAH (14-3-3 protein eta), YWHAE (14-3-3 protein epsilon), YWHAZ (14-3-3
  protein zeta/delta) or SFN (14-3-3 protein sigma) (Liu et al. 2002). Binding to
  14-3-3 proteins sequesters TSC2 to the cytosol and prevents its association with
  TSC1 (Cai et al. 2006).
