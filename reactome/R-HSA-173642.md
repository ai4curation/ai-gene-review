stable_id: R-HSA-173642
display_name: Disintegration of matrix layer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After fusion of the viral membrane with the target cell membrane, the viral
  core, which is surrounded by a layer of Matrix (p17) proteins, is exposed to the
  cytoplasm.  Disintegration of the Matrix layer allows for the conical-shaped viral
  core to be fully released, and allow for viral capsid dissociation and eventually
  reverse transcription.  Dissociation of the Matrix layer is not well characterized,
  but is believed to occur due to disruption of protein-protein interactions as a
  result of the conditions of the cytoplasm (including pH), which differ from that
  of the internal viral structure.
