stable_id: R-HSA-68913
display_name: The primase component of DNA polymerase:primase synthesizes a 6-10 nucleotide
  RNA primer at the origin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: At the beginning of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'DNA polymerase alpha:primase:DNA
  polymerase alpha:origin complex', and 1 molecule of 'NTP' are present. At the end
  of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'DNA polymerase epsilon', and 1 molecule of 'RNA
  primer:origin duplex:DNA polymerase alpha:primase complex' are present.<br><br>
  This reaction takes place in the 'nucleus' and  is mediated by the 'DNA-directed
  RNA polymerase activity' of 'DNA polymerase alpha:primase'.<br>
