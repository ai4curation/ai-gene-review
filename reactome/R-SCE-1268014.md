display_name: Precursor proteins enter TIM23 PAM complex
species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
summary: The TIM23 Complex resides in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion and
  transfers precursor proteins to the matrix.  The TIM23 complex appears to adopt
  different configurations (and perhaps different subunit compositions) depending
  on whether the substrate is destined for the inner membrane or the matrix. Here
  we refer to the TIM23 PAM complex as the configuration that delivers inner membrane
  proteins. The PAM17 subunit is required for this activity. The N-terminal presequence
  of precursors first interacts with TIM50 and TIM23 (Mokranjac et al. 2003, Martinez-Caballero
  et al. 2007, Tamura et al. 2009). The TIM17 and TIM23 subunits form a channel and
  are required to initiate translocation of precursors (Milislav et al. 2001). <br>
  Substrates of TIM23 PAM include Hsp60 (Gallas et al. 2006) and Yfh1 (Voisine et
  al. 2000).
