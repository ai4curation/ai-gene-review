display_name: Activation of RAC1 by the PXN:CRK complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PTK6 (BRK)-mediated phosphorylation of PXN (paxillin), which may be triggered
  by EGF treatment, leads to formation of the RAC1 guanyl nucleotide exchange factor
  complex composed of PXN and the CRK (CrkII) complex, which includes DOCK180 and
  ELMO1 or ELMO2. Exchange of RAC1-bound GDP for GTP results in PTK6-induced RAC1
  activation, which contributes to cell migration (Chen et al. 2004).
