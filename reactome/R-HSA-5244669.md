display_name: CDK1 phosphorylates lamins and facilitates depolymerization of lamin
  filaments
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylation of the N-termini of lamins by CDK1 (serine S23 of lamin B,
  serin S22 of lamin A and C) probably happens consequentially with phosphorylation
  of C-termini of lamins by PKC, and contributes to the depolymerization of lamin
  filaments and solubilization of the nuclear lamina (Ward and Kirschner 1990, Peter
  et al. 1990, Heald and McKeon 1990, Mall et al. 2012).
