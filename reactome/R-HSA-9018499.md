display_name: ESR1:ESTG and EP300 are recruited to TFF3 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TFF3 is an estrogen-responsive gene whose expression is primed prior to estrogen
  receptor binding by the formation of FOXA1- and GATA3-dependent chromatin loops.  Interaction
  of ligand-bound ESR1 with the enhancer promotes recruitment of EP300 and other chromatin
  modifiying enzymes, and stimulates the deposition of active chromatin marks like
  H3K4 methylation and H3K27 acteylation (Laganière et al, 2005; Theodorou et al,
  2013; reviewed in Zaret and Carroll, 2011)
