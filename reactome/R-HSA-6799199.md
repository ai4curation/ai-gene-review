display_name: COA1:MT-ND2, TMEM186:MT-ND3, MT-ND6, NDUFB6 bind the MCIA complex to
  form a 370kDa subcomplex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Membrane arm subunits COA1:MT-ND2, TMEM186:MT-ND3, MT-ND6 and NDUFB6 associate
  with the assembly factors TMEM126B, NDUFAF1, ECSIT and ACAD9 (which form the MCIA
  complex) forming a 370kDa subcomplex (Mckenzie & Ryan 2010, Andrews et al. 2013).
  Formosa et al. identified TMEM186 and COA1 as components of the MCIA complex with
  loss of either resulting in MCIA complex defects and reduced complex I assembly
  (Formosa et al. 2020). Transmembrane protein 186 (TMEM186) interacts strongly with
  ND3 while cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 1 homolog (COA1) interacts with ND2.
  Furthermore, FAD-dependent oxidoreductase domain-containing protein 1 (FOXRED1)
  is required for binding of NDUFB6 in Complex I (Formosa et al., 2015). Defects in
  FOXRED1 lead to Complex I deficiency (Fassone et al., 2010). Sideroflexin 4 (SFXN4)
  is also required for the assembly of this module. It interacts with newly synthesized
  ND6. Defects in SFXN4 cause combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency (Jackson
  et al., 2022).
