display_name: CTBP1,CTBP2 binds ZEB1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ZEB1 forms a complex with CTBP1 (CtBP) (Postigo and Dean 1999; Shi et al.
  2003; Ichikawa et a. 2015), as well as related CTBP2 (Postigo and Dean 1999), which
  is involved in ZEB1-mediated repression of genes involved in epithelial adhesion
  (Ichikawa et al. 2015, Zou et al. 2024). CTBP1-mediated repression of CDH1 gene
  transcription involves the recruitment of histone methyltransferases such as EHMT1
  (EuHMT) and EHMT2 (G9A), which are part of the CTBP co-repressor complex (Shi et
  al. 2003). PNN (Pinin), a protein involved in mRNA processing and implicated in
  the regulation of cell-cell adhesion, can relieve the CTBP1-mediated repression
  of the CDH1 gene promoter activity (Alpatov et al. 2004). Binding of MCRIP1 to CTBP1
  prevents formation of the complex between ZEB1 and CTBP1 (Ichikawa et al. 2015).
