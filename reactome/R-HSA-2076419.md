display_name: HS6STs sulfate GlcN at C6 in heparan sulfate/heparin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Heparan-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferases 1 and 2 (HS3ST1-2)  (Habuchi et al.
  1998, Habuchi et al. 2003 respectively) catalyze the transfer of sulfate to C6 of
  the N-sulfoglucosamine residue (GlcNS) of heparan sulfate. A third member HS3ST3
  that may also mediate this reaction has been characterised in mouse (Habuchi et
  al. 2000) but remains uncharacterised in humans. It can be argued that this structure
  can now be called either heparan sulfate- or heparin-PG. Mutations in HS3ST1 can
  cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH13, MIM:614880; Tornberg et al., 2011). Mutations
  in HS6ST2 can cause the neurodevelopmental disorder named Paganini-Miozzo syndrome
  (MRXSPM, MIM:301025; Paganini et al., 2019).
