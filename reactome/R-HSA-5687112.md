stable_id: R-HSA-5687112
display_name: MAPK6 is degraded by the 26S proteasome
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'MAPK6 is a short-lived protein with a half-life of 30 minutes in proliferating
  cells.  Turnover is promoted by the conjugation of ubiquitin to the free amino terminal
  by an unknown ligase and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (Coulombe
  et al, 2003; Coulombe et al, 2004). Ubiquitination and degradation of MAPK6 may
  also occur in the nucleus as well as the cytosol.
