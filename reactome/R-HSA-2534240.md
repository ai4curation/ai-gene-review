stable_id: R-HSA-2534240
display_name: HSPG2 (perlecan) degradation by MMP14, MMP15
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'HSPG2 protein (perlecan) consists of a core protein of molecular weight
  470 kDa with three long glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains attached, each approximately
  70-100 kDa. The GAG chains of HSPG2 bind growth factors in the ECM, and serve as
  co-ligands or ligand enhancers when bound to receptors.

  MMP14 and MMP15 (MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP) can degrade HSPG2 (d''Ortho et al. 1997). '
