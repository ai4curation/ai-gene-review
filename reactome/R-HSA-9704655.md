species: Homo sapiens
summary: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 1 (SARS-CoV-1) E protein
  induced apoptosis upon expression in the human Jurkat T-cells in the absence of
  growth factors (Yang Y et al. 2005). Overexpressed anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like protein
  1 (BCL2L1, also known as BCLX, Bcl-xL) inhibited T-cell apoptosis induced by SARS-CoV-1.
  BCL2L1 was found to interact with the viral E protein via the BH3 domain of BCL2L1
  and a BH3-like domain of E protein. SARS-CoV-1 E protein is thought to induce apoptosis
  by sequestering anti-apoptotic BCL2L1 to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) and Golgi, where the viral E protein is located (Yang Y et al. 2005). High
  levels of expression of pro‑apoptotic molecules may contribute to the depletion
  of T lymphocytes by apoptosis, leading to the lymphopenia observed in severely affected
  SARS patients (Diao B et al. 2020; Chen Z & Wherry EJ 2020).

## Summary

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 1 (SARS-CoV-1) E protein induced apoptosis upon expression in the human Jurkat T-cells in the absence of growth factors (Yang Y et al. 2005). Overexpressed anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like protein 1 (BCL2L1, also known as BCLX, Bcl-xL) inhibited T-cell apoptosis induced by SARS-CoV-1. BCL2L1 was found to interact with the viral E protein via the BH3 domain of BCL2L1 and a BH3-like domain of E protein. SARS-CoV-1 E protein is thought to induce apoptosis by sequestering anti-apoptotic BCL2L1 to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi, where the viral E protein is located (Yang Y et al. 2005). High levels of expression of pro‑apoptotic molecules may contribute to the depletion of T lymphocytes by apoptosis, leading to the lymphopenia observed in severely affected SARS patients (Diao B et al. 2020; Chen Z & Wherry EJ 2020).
