display_name: FLIP(L) and procaspase-8 form heterodimer in FasL/CD95 signaling
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Pro-caspase-8 and FLIP(L) are recruited to FAS/CD95 receptor complex where
  FLIP(L) forms a heterodimer with caspase-8 through both death effector domain (DED)
  and caspase-like domain (CLD). In addition, FLIP(L) can also regulate signaling
  via interaction with the DED of FADD. The regulatory function of FLIP(L) has been
  found to differ depending on its expression levels. FLIP(L) was shown to inhibit
  death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptosis only when expressed at high levels, while
  low cell levels of FLIP-L enhanced DR signaling to apoptosis (Chang DW et al. 2002;
  Fricker N et al. 2010; Toivonen HT et al. 2011; Boatright KM et al. 2004; Okano
  H et al. 2003). The expression levels of c-FLIP proteins were shown to be regulated
  by NFkappaB signaling pathway (Micheau O et a. 2001; Kreuz S et al 2001).
