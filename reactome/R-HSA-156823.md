display_name: Association of phospho-L13a with GAIT element of Ceruloplasmin mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Although the  mechanism through which L13a  prevents  translation initiation
  has not been determined, Mazumder et al. (2003) have described four alternatives.
  L13a could (1) inhibit the function of eIF4F,  (2) block the recruitment of the
  43S preinitiation complex, (3) prevent scanning of the 43S complex to the initiation
  codon, or 4) interfere with joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit.
