stable_id: R-HSA-162836
display_name: uPAR precursor + acyl-GPI -> uPAR-acyl-GPI + uPAR propeptide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the endoplasmic reticulum, the precursor form of urokinase plasminogen
  activator receptor is transamidated at residue 305, replacing the 30 carboxyterminal
  residues of the protein with an acylated glucosylphosphatidylinositol (acyl-GPI)
  moiety. The released carboxyterminal propeptide has no known function. The reaction
  is catalyzed by GPI transamidase, a complex of at least five proteins associated
  with the lumenal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Yu et al. 1997;
  Ohishi et al. 2001; Hong et al. 2003).
