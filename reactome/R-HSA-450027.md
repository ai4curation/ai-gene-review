display_name: Interleukin-2 receptor alpha:IL2 binds Interleukin-2 receptor beta
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The crystal structure of the assembled IL2:IL2 receptor complex and experiments
  using isothermal titration calorimetry suggest that the complex of IL2 with IL2R
  alpha is likely to preferentially associate with IL2R bet (Rickert et al. 2004,
  Stauber et al. 2006). Binding of IL-2/IL-2R alpha to IL-2R beta significantly slows
  the dissociation of IL-2. However, the trimeric complex of IL-2:IL-2R alpha:IL-2R
  beta is incapable of signaling without participation of the gamma chain.
