display_name: L1 linked to actin cytoskeleton by ankyrin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Ankyrins are bifunctional linker proteins that tether L1 to the membrane
  associated, spectrin based actin cytoskeleton. Spectrin is a tetramer of two alpha-
  and two beta-chains. The spectrin alpha chain has 21 and the beta chain has 16 (conventional
  beta) or 30 (heavy beta) successive triple helix repeats.  At the N-terminus of
  beta spectrin, there is a pair of CH (calponin homology) domains which together
  form an actin binding domain, while the triple helical repeats 14-15 bind ankyrin.
  <br>Interaction with spectrin bound F-actin blocks the mobility of L1 and this immobilization
  mediates adjacent neuron adhesions.
