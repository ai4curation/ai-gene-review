display_name: B3GAT dimers transfer GlcA to tetrasaccharide linker
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Galactosylgalactosylxylosylprotein 3-beta-glucuronosyltransferase 3 (B3GAT3)
  (Ouzzine et al. 2000) transfers a glucuronate (GlcA) residue via a beta1,3-linkage
  to a Gal-Gal-Xyl moiety. It is possible that B3GAT1 (Kitagawa et al. 1998) and B3GAT2
  (Marcos et al. 2002) do also have this activity since they enable this transfer
  onto a Gal-GlcNAc moeity in the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 epitope. The B3GATs are
  homodimeric and require manganese as a cofactor (Kakuda et al. 2004, Ouzzine et
  al. 2000). The tetrasaccharide linker is now complete, ready to accept further hexosamine
  additions. The type of hexosamine added is critical in determining which glycosaminoglycan
  (GAG) is formed.
