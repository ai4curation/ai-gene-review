display_name: COQ4 decarboxylates MHDB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: COQ4 is a zinc-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation step in
  CoQ biosynthesis (Pelosi et al., 2024 and Nicoll et al., 2024). However, the substrate
  and the product of the decarboxylation step remain ambiguous since Nicoll et al.
  reported a decarboxylation of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-5-decaprenylbenzoate (MHDB) into
  2-methoxy-6-decaprenylphenol (DMPhOH), whereas Pelosi et al. proposed that COQ4
  catalyzes an oxidative decarboxylation which yields a hydroxylated product. In this
  case, DHB rather than MHDB was proposed a substrate for COQ4, generating 3-polyprenyl-4-hydroxyphenol
  as a product. We are provisionally showing the first reaction until more data is
  available.
