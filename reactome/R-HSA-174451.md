display_name: Recruitment of DNA2 endonuclease to the C strand
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After RPA binds the long flap, it recruits the DNA2 helicase/endonuclease
  which removes the initiator RNA primers of Okazaki fragments (Bae et al. 2001).
  DNA2 is also needed to resolve G quadruplexes (G4), DNA structures commonly formed
  by polyguanine-rich telomeric DNA sequences (Masuda-Sasa et al. 2008, Lin et al.
  2013).
