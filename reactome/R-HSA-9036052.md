display_name: Defective NAGLU does not hydrolyse heparan chain(2)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MPS IIIB (Sanfilippo syndrome B, Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, MIM:252920)
  is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder due to loss of function of alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase
  (NAGLU; MIM:609701), normally involved in the hydrolysis of terminal non-reducing
  N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in heparan and heparan sulfate (HS). Mutations that
  cause severe forms of MPSIIIB are R674C or H (Zhao et al. 1998), R297X (Yogalingam
  & Hopwood 2001, Zhao et al. 1998) and R626X (Beesley et al 2004).
