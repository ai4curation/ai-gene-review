stable_id: R-HSA-2294580
display_name: PLK1 hyperphosphorylates Condensin II complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once PLK1 is recruited to the chromatin-bound condensin II complex, it phosphorylates
  the NCAPD3 subunit of condensin II on serine residue S1419, and possibly other residues.
  In addition to phosphorylating NCAPD3, PLK1 phosphorylates other condensin II subunits,
  NCAPG2 and NCAPH2. However, the phosphorylation sites have not yet been determined.
  PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of the condensin II complex facilitates condensation
  of prophase chromosomes (Abe et al. 2011).
