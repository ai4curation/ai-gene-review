species: Homo sapiens
summary: At the beginning of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'Cdc20:phospho-APC/C:Cyclin
  B:Cdc2 complex', and 3 molecules of 'ubiquitin' are present. At the end of this
  reaction, 1 molecule of 'multiubiquitinated Cyclin B:Cdc2:Cdc20:phospho-APC/C complex'
  is present.<br><br> This reaction takes place in the 'cytosol' and  is mediated
  by the 'ubiquitin-protein ligase activity' of 'Cdc20:Phospho-APC/C'.<br>
