stable_id: R-NUL-1504194
display_name: mDvl1 binds FZD7
species: Mus musculus
summary: The PDZ domain of mDvl1 mediates a direct interaction with a conserved motif
  of FZD7 that is located just after the seventh transmembrane segment of the receptor.  This
  FZD-Dvl interaction is thought to initiate recruitment of Axin-GSK3-beta to the
  membrane by virtue of the interaction between Axin and the DIX domain of Dvl.
