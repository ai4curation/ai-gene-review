summary: 'Interleukin-12 subunit alpha (IL12A, IL12p35) binds Interleukin-27 subunit
  beta (EBI3) forming the Interleukin-35 heterodimeric complex (IL12A:EBI3)(Devergne

  (ER) resident molecular chaperone calnexin (CANX) and is retained in the ER (Devergne
  et al. 1997). Co-expression of IL27 and EBI3 enables formation of IL27:EBI3, allowing
