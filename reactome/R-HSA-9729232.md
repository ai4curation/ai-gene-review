summary: In expression studies, SARS-CoV-1 nonstructural protein (nsp1) induces degradation
  of host mRNAs and suppresses host translation (Kamitani et al, 2006). Host translational
  suppression, often detected in virus-infected cells, is an effective viral defensive
  strategy for suppressing host innate immune responses and freeing host translational
  machinery for viral-specific gene expression. Nsp1 binds tightly to 40S ribosomal
  subunits and inactivates them, preventing formation of the 80S complex and efficiently
  suppressing translation (Kamitani et al, 2009; Narayanan et al, 2015).<p>Although
  nsp1 induces endonucleolytic cleavage near the 5′UTR of the capped mRNA, SARS-CoV-1
  mRNA is resistant to cleavage by nsp1 (Huang et al, 2011). Specifically, interaction
  of nsp1 with the 5′UTR, the leader sequence located in the 5′ ends of all of the
  viral mRNAs of SARS-CoV-1, confers resistance to the nsp1-mediated translational
  shutoff and enhances viral RNA replication (Tanaka et al, 2012). However, nsp1 does
  not possess any intrinsic nuclease activity and possibly, recruits a cellular endonuclease
  for inducing mRNA cleavage (Huang et al, 2011, Kamitani et al, 2009). The identity
  of this putative cellular endonuclease is still unknown (Narayanan et al, 2015).

## Summary

In expression studies, SARS-CoV-1 nonstructural protein (nsp1) induces degradation of host mRNAs and suppresses host translation (Kamitani et al, 2006).
