species: Homo sapiens
summary: The IFNG receptor complex is a pre-assembled entity, as constitutive interactions
  are seen between IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, and between two IFNGR2 chains in the absence
  of ligand IFNG. JAK1 and JAK2 constitutively associate with the intracellular domains
  of the subunits of the IFNG receptor complex, providing it with tyrosine kinase
  activity. In unstimulated cells JAK1 preferentially associates with IFNGR1 and while
  JAK2 associates with IFNGR2 chains. JAK1 enhances the interaction between IFNGR1
  and IFNGR2 chains, and thus has a major role in the pre-assembly of the IFNGR complex,
  in contrast the kinase activity of JAK2 is required to observe any signaling by
  IFNG.<br>IFNG binds directly to both the receptor chains IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. IFNGR1
  is a high affinity receptor and binds directly to IFNG whereas IFNGR2 binds to IFNG
  in presence of IFNGR1. According to Krause et al. model IFNG binds to IFNGR1 chains
  first and then IFNGR2 chains interact with the IFNGR1:IFNG:IFNGR1 complex.
