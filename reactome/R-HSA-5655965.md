display_name: POLK and POLZ cooperate in elongation of mispaired primer termini
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'DNA polymerase kappa (POLK) can elongate mispaired primer termini generated
  when an incorrect nucleotide is incorporated opposite a damaged DNA base either
  by POLK or by another translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerase (Haracska et al.
  2002, Carlson et al. 2006). POLK can processively synthesize polynucleotide chains
  that are usually not more than 20 nucleotides long, generating single base substitutions
  at a rate of 7/1000 and single base deletions at a rate of 3/1000 (Ohashi et al.
  2000). POLK and POLZ can cooperate in the elongation of nucleotides inserted opposite
  to lesioned bases by POLK (Yoon et al. 2010, Wojtaszek et al. 2012a, Wojtaszek et
  al. 2012b, Xie et al. 2012, Yoon et al. 2014) '
