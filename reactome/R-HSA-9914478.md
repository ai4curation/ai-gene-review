display_name: SSBP1 binds the displaced parental H strand
species: Homo sapiens
summary: As POLG:POLG2 in the replisome polymerizes the nascent H strand, the parental
  H strand is displaced and bound by tetramers of single strand binding protein 1
  (SSBP1) (Oliveira et al. 2010, Miralles Fusté et al. 2014, Qian and Johnson 2017,
  Kaur et al. 2018, Plaza-G A et al. 2023). The presence of SSBP1 on the parental
  H strand limits initiation of L strand replication to the OriL site (Miralles Fusté
  et al. 2014) and enhances the strand displacement activity of POLG:POLG2 (Bermek
  and Ciesielski 2021, Plaza-G A et al. 2023). SSBP1 also enhances helicase activity
  of TWNK (PEO1) in the replisome through an incompletely characterized mechanism
  (Oliveira and Kaguni 2010, Bermek and Ciesielski 2021, Rodrigues and Oliveira 2021,
  Kaur et al. 2021).

## Summary

The presence of SSBP1 on the parental H strand limits initiation of L strand replication to the OriL site (Miralles Fusté et al. 2014) and enhances the strand displacement activity of POLG:POLG2 (Bermek and Ciesielski 2021, Plaza-G A et al. 2023). SSBP1 also enhances helicase activity of TWNK (PEO1) in the replisome through an incompletely characterized mechanism (Oliveira and Kaguni 2010, Bermek and Ciesielski 2021, Rodrigues and Oliveira 2021, Kaur et al. 2021).
