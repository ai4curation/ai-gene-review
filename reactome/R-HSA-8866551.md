display_name: CFTR binds components of the ERAD machinery for ubiquitination and degradation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Up to two thirds of wild-type CFTR is targeted for co-translational degradation
  by the ERAD pathway due to inefficient folding (Jensen et al, 1995; Ward et al,
  1994; Ward et al, 1995; Gelman et al, 2002; Lukacs et al, 1994).  Misfolded CFTR
  is ubiquitinated in the ER by E3 ligases RNF5 and RNF185, likely as part of a mulitprotein
  retrotranslocation complex containing the hexameric ATPase VCP and various scaffolding
  and structural proteins (reviewed in Vembar and Brodsky, 2008). Consistent with
  this, RNF185 interacts directly both with CFTR and with other components of the
  ERAD machinery, including E2 proteins, ERLIN and DERLIN proteins (Younger et al,
  2006; El Khouri et al, 2013). '

## Summary

Up to two thirds of wild-type CFTR is targeted for co-translational degradation by the ERAD pathway due to inefficient folding (Jensen et al, 1995; Ward et al, 1994; Ward et al, 1995; Gelman et al, 2002; Lukacs et al, 1994).  Misfolded CFTR is ubiquitinated in the ER by E3 ligases RNF5 and RNF185, likely as part of a mulitprotein retrotranslocation complex containing the hexameric ATPase VCP and various scaffolding and structural proteins (reviewed in Vembar and Brodsky, 2008). Consistent with this, RNF185 interacts directly both with CFTR and with other components of the ERAD machinery, including E2 proteins, ERLIN and DERLIN proteins (Younger et al, 2006; El Khouri et al, 2013).
