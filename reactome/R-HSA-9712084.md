stable_id: R-HSA-9712084
display_name: PI3K synthesizes PIP3 downstream of ALK mutants
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3 downstream of activated ALK fusions and
  mutants, leading to activation of the AKT pathway as assessed by S473 phosphorylation
  (Bai et al, 2000; Slupianek et al, 2001; Slupianek et al, 2004; Chen et al, 2008).  AKT
  signaling contributes to apoptotic escape and cellular proliferation through regulation
  of proteins such as CDKN1B/p27, CCND2 and BCL2L11/BIM, among others (Gu et al, 2004;
  Rassidakis et al, 2005; Marzec et al, 2007; reviewed in Chiarle et al, 2008; Hallberg
  and Palmer, 2013).
