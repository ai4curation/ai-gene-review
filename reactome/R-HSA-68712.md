  Cdt1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: From the end of anaphase and throughout G1, the Cdh1 (FZR1) containing anaphase-promoting
  complex (APC/C:Cdh1) ubiquitinates geminin (GMNN), targeting it for degradation
  and enabling release of CDT1 and the subsequent association of CDT1 with the replication
  origins.The presence of an APC destruction box in geminin and its APC/C-mediated
  ubiquitination and degradation was first demonstrated in Xenopus egg extracts (McGarry
  and Kirschner 1998) and was later confirmed in human cells, where it was shown to
  largely depend on Cdh1 and not Cdc20 component of the APC/C (Pfleger et al. 2001;
  Di Fiore and Pines 2007; Machida and Dutta 2007). Emi1 (FBXO5) mediated inhibition
  of the APC/C:Cdh1 complex in S and G2 phases is needed for stabilization of geminin
  and prevention of re-replication (Di Fiore and Pines 2007; Machida and Dutta 2007).

## Summary

From the end of anaphase and throughout G1, the Cdh1 (FZR1) containing anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C:Cdh1) ubiquitinates geminin (GMNN), targeting it for degradation and enabling release of CDT1 and the subsequent association of CDT1 with the replication origins.The presence of an APC destruction box in geminin and its APC/C-mediated ubiquitination and degradation was first demonstrated in Xenopus egg extracts (McGarry and Kirschner 1998) and was later confirmed in human cells, where it was shown to largely depend on Cdh1 and not Cdc20 component of the APC/C (Pfleger et al. 2001; Di Fiore and Pines 2007; Machida and Dutta 2007).
