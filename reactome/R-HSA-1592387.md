display_name: Fibulin binds elastic fibres
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Fibulins are a family of 7 genes encoding calcium binding glycoproteins with
  distinct roles in elastogenesis. They are essential for elastic fibre formation,
  having a role in regulating and organising tropoelastin formation (Yanagisawa &
  Davis 2010). Fibulins 1-5 all bind elastin (Roark et al. 1995, Sasaki et al. 1999,
  Kobayashi et al. 2007). Fibulins 2, 4, 5 and 7 also bind fibrillin (Reinhardt et
  al. 1996, El Hallous et al. 2007, de Vega et al. 2007). Fibulin 6 has a role in
  the formation of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis but its binding partners
  are unclear (Xu & Vogel 2011).
