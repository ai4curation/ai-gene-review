species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once ATP is bound, myosin, which is an ATPase, uses the energy from the cleavage
  of the terminal phosphate to pivot the myosin head back, away from the actin filamentous
  chain. This change in conformation "resets" the myosin molecule, leaving it ready
  to bind the actin filament once more and slide the myosin filament along the actin
  filament, continuing the contractile cycle.

# ATP Hydrolysis By Myosin

**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

Once ATP is bound, myosin, which is an ATPase, uses the energy from the cleavage of the terminal phosphate to pivot the myosin head back, away from the actin filamentous chain. This change in conformation "resets" the myosin molecule, leaving it ready to bind the actin filament once more and slide the myosin filament along the actin filament, continuing the contractile cycle.
