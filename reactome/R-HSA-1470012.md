display_name: Disassociation and translocation of STATs to the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After dimerization STAT dimers release from the receptor complex and migrate
  to the nucleus for DNA binding. STAT5s/STAT1alpha heterodimeric complexes specifically
  recognize beta-casein promoter region (PIE) (Brizzi et al. 1999). c-Kit dependent
  JAK/STAT activation is associated with the growth and differentiation of fetal liver
  haematopoietic progenitor cells (Rönnstrand 2004, Reber et al. 2006).
