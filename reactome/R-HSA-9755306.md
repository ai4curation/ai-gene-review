display_name: ub UBXN7 is degraded by the 26S proteasome
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After MUL1-dependent ubiquitination, UBXN7 is degraded by the 26 S proteasome.
  This results in increased levels of NFE2L2 and corresponding decreased levels in
  HIF1alpha (Cilenti et al, 2020; Di Gregorio et al, 2021).

## Summary

After MUL1-dependent ubiquitination, UBXN7 is degraded by the 26 S proteasome. This results in increased levels of NFE2L2 and corresponding decreased levels in HIF1alpha (Cilenti et al, 2020; Di Gregorio et al, 2021).
