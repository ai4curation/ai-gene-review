stable_id: R-HSA-373734
display_name: Nephrin interacts with Podocin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NPHS2 encodes podocin, a protein exclusively expressed in podocytes in developing
  and mature glomeruli. Podocin is a member of the stomatin protein family with a
  short N terminal domain, a membrane-anchoring region, and a cytosolic C-terminal
  domain. Podocin accumulates in an oligomeric form in lipid rafts of the slit diaphragm.
  The C-terminal domain of Podocin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of nephrin thus
  it may function as a scaffolding protein connecting nephrin with the actin cytoskeleton.
  Beside nephrin it was shown that podocin also interacts with several other SD proteins,
  hence forming functional microdomains
