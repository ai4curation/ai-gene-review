display_name: Ligation of newly synthesized repair patch to incised DNA in GG-NER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The nucleotide excision repair (NER) is completed when the newly synthesized
  fragment is ligated to the incised DNA strand, thus closing the single stranded
  nick (SSB). Two DNA ligases, LIG1 and LIG3, can perform the ligation in global genome
  NER (GG-NER), as well as in transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) (Arakawa et al. 2012,
  Paul-Konietzko et al. 2015).
