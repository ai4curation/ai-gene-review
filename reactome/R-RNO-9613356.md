display_name: Plins bind Hspa8
species: Rattus norvegicus
summary: Lipophagy is the process of autophagic degradation of lipid droplets into
  fatty acids. A key step in this process is the elimination of perilipin (Plin) proteins
  on lipid droplet surface. This mechanism is initiated when the cytosolic Heat shock
  cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) binds Plin2 and Plin3 on the lipid droplet surface.
  Consequently, perilipins are phosphorylated and targeted to degradation making the
  lipid available for hydrolysis (S Kaushik et al. 2015).
