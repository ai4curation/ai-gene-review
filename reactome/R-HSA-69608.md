species: Homo sapiens
summary: <p>DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation (IR) leads to phosphorylation
  of CDC25A by CHEK2 (Chk2) in a TP53-independent manner (Falck et al. 2001) on serine
  residues S124 (Falck et al. 2001, Sorensen et al. 2003), S178 (Sorensen et al. 2003),
  and S293 (Sorensen et al. 2003), promoting CDC25A proteolysis (Falck et al. 2001,
  Sorensen et al. 2003). In vitro, CHEK2 phosphorylates CDC25A on serine and threonine
  residues but endogenous CDC25A is only phosphorylated on serine residues (Hassepass
  et al. 2003). Seven evolutionarily conserved serine residues in CDC25A (S76, S124,
  S156, S178, S185, S293, S505) correspond to the consensus CHEK1/CHEK2 phosphorylation
  motif Arg-X-X-Ser (Hassepass et al. 2003). Serine to alanine substitution at S124
  significantly increases the half-life of CDC25A (Sorensen et al. 2003). CHEK2-phosphorylated
  sites in CDC25A partially overlap with CHEK1-phosphorylated sites (Sorensen et al.
  2003, Jin et al. 2008).</p><p> CDC25A is almost completely downregulated 30 minutes

  with an increased inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK2 at Y15, a reduction of the
  S phase-promoting CCNE:CDK2 kinase activity, and ~50% inhibition of DNA synthesis
  (Falck et al. 2001). Ectopic overexpression of CDC25A results in radioresistant
  DNA synthesis and can be mimicked by ectopic expression of CDK2 mutant with T14A
  and Y15F substitutions (Falck et al. 2001).</p><p>The sudy by Falck et al. 2001

  with activating phosphorylation of CHEK2 but not CHEK1 (Chk1), but a study by Jin
  et al. 2008 showed that CHEK1 is also involved in CDC25A destabilization upon IR
  treatment (see below). Some of the cancer-associated CHEK2 variants are defective
  in their ability to bind and phosphorylate CDC25A (Falck et al. 2001). Irradiated
  ATM-defective cells isolated from ataxia-telangiectasia patients are unable to activate
  CHEK2 and downregulate CDC25A protein level and activity (Falck et al. 2001). In
  the study by Sorensen et al. 2003, however, it was shown that CHEK2 on its own was
  unable to induce the G1/S arrest in IR-treated HeLa cells and that CHEK1 activity
  was needed (Sorensen et al. 2003), which was reproduced in normal human diploid
  fibroblasts (Zhao et al. 2002). These findings are additionally corroborated by
  a study showing that CHEK2 does not phosphorylate S76 residue of CDC25A and that
  CHEK2 depletion does not lead to additional stabilization of CDC25A in CHEK1-depleted
  cells upon IR or UV treatment, while CHEK1 depletion leads to significant additional
  stabilization of CDC25A in CHEK2-depleted cells (Jin et al. 2008).</p>
