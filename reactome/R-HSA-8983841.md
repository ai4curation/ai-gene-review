## Summary

Interleukin-35 (IL35) binding activates the IL35 receptor complex and facilitates JAKs phosphorylation. Subsequently, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (STAT1) binds to the receptor complex and is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (Collison et al. 2012). This is a black box event because the receptor subunit responsible for STAT1 binding to the receptor is unclear.
