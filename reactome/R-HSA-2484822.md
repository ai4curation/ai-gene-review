stable_id: R-HSA-2484822
display_name: Kinetochore assembly
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The kinetochore assembly on centromeres of replicated chromosomes is completed
  by mitotic prometaphase. Some kinetochore components are associated with centromeres
  throughout the cell cycle while others associate with centromeres during mitosis.
  The sequential kinetochore assembly and kinetochore dynamics is not shown here.
  For a review of this process, please refer to Cheeseman and Desai 2008.
