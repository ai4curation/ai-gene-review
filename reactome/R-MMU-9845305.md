  methylates cytosine in DNA
species: Mus musculus
summary: A piRNA bound to Piwil4 (Miwi2) interacts by base complementarity with a
  nascent transcript of a transposable element, thus bringing Piwil4 to the transposable
  element locus (Zoch et al. 2020). Piwi4l of the piRNA:Piwi4l complex binds Spocd1,
  which recruits Dnmt3a and Dnmt3l to methylate the DNA of the transposable element
  (Zoch et al. 2020). piRNAs thereby direct methylation of the genome (Aravin et al.
  2008) by acting via Piwi4l, Spocd1, and DNA methyltransferases. Piwi4l also interacts
  with the NuRD and BAF chromatin modifying complexes (Zoch et al. 2020). Tex15 is
  required for DNA methylation, but does not associate with Spocd1 and may act upstream
  or in parallel to Spocd1 (Schopp et al. 2020).

## Summary

A piRNA bound to Piwil4 (Miwi2) interacts by base complementarity with a nascent transcript of a transposable element, thus bringing Piwil4 to the transposable element locus (Zoch et al. 2020). Piwi4l of the piRNA:Piwi4l complex binds Spocd1, which recruits Dnmt3a and Dnmt3l to methylate the DNA of the transposable element (Zoch et al. 2020). piRNAs thereby direct methylation of the genome (Aravin et al. 2008) by acting via Piwi4l, Spocd1, and DNA methyltransferases. Piwi4l also interacts with the NuRD and BAF chromatin modifying complexes (Zoch et al. 2020). Tex15 is required for DNA methylation, but does not associate with Spocd1 and may act upstream or in parallel to Spocd1 (Schopp et al. 2020).
