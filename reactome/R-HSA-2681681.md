display_name: Tenascins C, R, (X, N) bind fibronectin matrix
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Tenascins are a family of 4 oligomeric extracellular glycoproteins, tenascin
  (TN) C, R, X, and N (also called W). In rotary shadowing images TNC is seen as a
  symmetrical structure called a hexabrachion (Erickson & Iglesias 1984). This hexamer
  is formed from initial trimers (Kammerer et al. 1988). All members of the family
  are believed able to form trimers but only C, R and N have the extra cysteine required
  for form hexamers.  All have amino-terminal heptad repeats, epidermal growth factor
  (EGF)-like repeats, fibronectin type III domain repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal
  fibrinogen-like globular domain (Hsia & Schwartzbauer 2005). TNC was the first to
  be discovered and is the best characterised. Its subunits vary greatly in size due
  to glycosylation and splicing isoforms (Joester & Faissner 1999). During embryonic
  development TNC is expressed in neural, skeletal, and vascular tissues. In adults
  it is detectable only in tendon and tissues undergoing remodeling processes such
  as wound repair and neovascularization, or in pathological processes such as inflammation
  and tumorigenesis. TNR forms dimers and trimers (Norenberg et al. 1992) and is expressed
  only in the central nervous system. TNC and TNR-null mice (single and double knock-outs)
  have surprisingly normal gross phenotypes, but exhibit behavioural and wound healing
  abnormalities (Mackie & Tucker 1999, Montag-Sallaz & Montag 2003). TNX is the largest
  member of the family and is widely expressed during development, but in adults is
  limited to musculoskeletal, cardiac, and dermal tissue. It can form trimers, though
  it lacks the amino-terminal cysteine residues involved in hexamer formation. It
  is clearly associated with a variant of a heritable connective tissue disorder known
  as Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, which is associated with fibrillar collagen defects (Burch
  et al. 1997, Mao et al. 2002). TNY is thought to be an avian orthologue of TNX (Chiquet-Ehrismann
  2004). TNN, first identified in zebrafish (Weber et al. 1998), is the least well
  characterized member of the tenascin family. It forms hexamers (Degen et al. 2007)
  and is expressed in developing skeletal tissue and neural crest cells, a pattern
  that partially overlaps with TNC. <br><br>TNC and TNR bind with high affinity to
  fibronectin (FN) (Chiquet-Ehrismann et al. 1991, Chung et al. 1995, Chung & Erickson
  1997, Hauzenberger et al. 1999, Ingham et al. 2004, To & Midwood 2011, Pesheva et
  al. 1994), modulating the cell adhesion function of FN either by binding or restricting
  access of FN to integrin binding sites (Lightner & Erickson 1990) or by binding
  to cell receptors and altering their responsiveness to FN (Prieto et al. 1992, Fischer
  et al. 1997). The interaction of Tenascin and FN impacts tissue structure by controlling
  the assembly, maintenance, and turnover of the ECM at the cell surface (To & Midwood
  2010).
