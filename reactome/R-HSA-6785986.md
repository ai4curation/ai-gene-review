display_name: DNA nucleases unhook the interstrand crosslink (ICL)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Unhooking of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) from damaged DNA (ICL-DNA) involves
  coordinated action of several DNA nucleases: FAN1, DCLRE1A or DCLRE1B, the complex
  of ERCC1 and ERCC4 (XPF), and the complex of SLX4 (FANCP), SLX1A, MUS81 and EME1
  or EME2. These DNA nucleases incise ICL-DNA at both sides of the ICL, thus removing
  the covalent bond between the two DNA strands. The exact sequence of incision steps
  has not been determined and it is possible that some of the implicated nucleases
  act in a redundant manner.<p>FAN1 exhibits 5''->3'' endonuclease activity, as well
  as 5''->3'' exonuclease activity, with a preference for 5'' flaps and branched DNA
  structures (Smogorzewska et al. 2010, Kratz et al. 2010, MacKay et al. 2010, Liu
  et al. 2010). The FAN1 head-to-tail homodimer recognizes the lesion, orients and
  unwinds the 5'' flap (Zhao et al. 2014). FAN1 requires a 5'' terminal phosphate
  anchor and successively cleaves the DNA at every third nucleotide (Wang et al. 2014).
  This suggests that an incision 5'' to the ICL precedes the action of FAN1.<p>ERCC4
  (XPF) in complex with ERCC1 may perform the first endonucleolytic incision 5'' to
  the ICL (Wang et al. 2011), while MUS81 in complex with EME1 or EME2 may act as
  a backup endonuclease. DCLRE1A (SNM1A) exhibits a 5''->3'' exonuclease activity
  and can digest past the ICL, thereby unhooking it from one DNA strand after the
  ERCC1:ERCC4 complex does the initial incision 5'' to the ICL (Wang et al. 2011).
  DCLRE1A functions redundantly with DCLRE1B (SNM1B) in ICL repair (Ishiai et al.
  2004, Sangerova et al. 2012).'

## Summary

Unhooking of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) from damaged DNA (ICL-DNA) involves coordinated action of several DNA nucleases: FAN1, DCLRE1A or DCLRE1B, the complex of ERCC1 and ERCC4 (XPF), and the complex of SLX4 (FANCP), SLX1A, MUS81 and EME1 or EME2. These DNA nucleases incise ICL-DNA at both sides of the ICL, thus removing the covalent bond between the two DNA strands. The exact sequence of incision steps has not been determined and it is possible that some of the implicated nucleases act in a redundant manner.<p>FAN1 exhibits 5'->3' endonuclease activity, as well as 5'->3' exonuclease activity, with a preference for 5' flaps and branched DNA structures (Smogorzewska et al. 2010, Kratz et al. 2010, MacKay et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2010). The FAN1 head-to-tail homodimer recognizes the lesion, orients and unwinds the 5' flap (Zhao et al. 2014). FAN1 requires a 5' terminal phosphate anchor and successively cleaves the DNA at every third nucleotide (Wang et al. 2014). This suggests that an incision 5' to the ICL precedes the action of FAN1.<p>ERCC4 (XPF) in complex with ERCC1 may perform the first endonucleolytic incision 5' to the ICL (Wang et al. 2011), while MUS81 in complex with EME1 or EME2 may act as a backup endonuclease.
