stable_id: R-HSA-3222237
display_name: SMYD2 methylates TP53
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The lysine methyltransferase SMYD2 methylates TP53 (p53) on lysine residue
  K370, thus repressing TP53 transcriptional activity. The methylation at K370 is
  inhibited if TP53 is pre-methylated at K372 (Huang et al. 2006).

## Summary

The lysine methyltransferase SMYD2 methylates TP53 (p53) on lysine residue K370, thus repressing TP53 transcriptional activity. The methylation at K370 is inhibited if TP53 is pre-methylated at K372 (Huang et al. 2006).
