display_name: ABCE1:ATP binds PELO:HBS1L-1:GTP:80S ribosome:non-stop mRNA:peptidyl-tRNA
  with nascent peptide and HBS1L-1:GDP is released
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HBS1L, a paralog of eRF3, hydrolyzes GTP, causing HBS1L:GDP to dissociate
  from the stalled 80S ribosome (Shao et al. 2013, and inferred from human PELO:HBS1L
  and ABCE1 and rabbit ribosomes in Pisareva et al. 2011. reviewed in Franckenberg
  et al. 2012). The dissociation exposes a surface on PELO for ABCE1 to bind and allows
  the central domain of PELO to move towards the peptidyl-tRNA in P site of the 80S
  ribosome (reviewed in Franckenberg et al. 2012).
