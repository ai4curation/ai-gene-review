stable_id: R-HSA-981535
display_name: CD55 (DAF) binds C3bBb, C4bC2a
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Decay-accelerating-factor (DAF, CD55) is a membrane- bound complement regulatory
  protein that inhibits autologous complement cascade activation. It is expressed
  on all cells that are in close contact with serum complement proteins, but also
  on cells outside the vascular space and on tumour cells.  DAF binds to C3bBb and
  C4bC2a on cell surfaces, accelerating their dissociation and thereby inhibiting
  the amplification of complement. DAF can bind C3b and Bb, and must bind both for
  efficient decay acceleration. Although it can bind the inactive proenzymes C3b and
  C4b, the regulatory function of DAF is believed to be inhibition of activated C3
  convertase enzymes (Harris et al. 2007).
