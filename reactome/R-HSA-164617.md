species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The elongation reaction proceeds as follows: The template of hTERC directs
  the sequential addition of nucleotides to the 3'' telomeric DNA end. Following addition
  of a nucleotide, the template and catalytic site must move relative to one another
  within the telomerase RNP to place the appropriate template residue in the active
  site. As base-pairing and nucleotide addition occur at one end of the template,
  base pair melting occurs at the other (Collins and Greider 1993; Wang and Blackburn,
  1997; Hammond and Cech 1998; Benjamin et al. 2000; Forstemann and Lingner 2005).
  This un-pairing is thought to reduce the energy used for mediating the subsequent
  translocation step. Nucleotide addition can occur up until the template boundary
  which in hTERC is defined by a helix called P1b (Chen and Greider 2003).<br>'

## Summary

Following addition of a nucleotide, the template and catalytic site must move relative to one another within the telomerase RNP to place the appropriate template residue in the active site. As base-pairing and nucleotide addition occur at one end of the template, base pair melting occurs at the other (Collins and Greider 1993; Wang and Blackburn, 1997; Hammond and Cech 1998; Benjamin et al. 2000; Forstemann and Lingner 2005).
