display_name: Defective B3GAT3 does not transfer GlcA to tetrasaccharide linker
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'B3GAT3 (Ouzzine et al. 2000), along with B3GAT1 and 2, transfers a glucuronate
  (GlcA) residue via a beta1,3-linkage to a terminal galactose to complete the tetrasaccharide
  linker sequence. The B3GAT3 mutant R277Q causes almost complete loss of activity
  (3-5% of wt) and results in the production of immature and lower numbers of dermatan
  sulfate (DS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains (Baasanjav et al. 2011). This defect
  causes multiple joint dislocations, short stature, craniofacial dysmorphism, and
  congenital heart defects (JDSSDHD; MIM:245600). '

## Summary

B3GAT3 (Ouzzine et al. 2000), along with B3GAT1 and 2, transfers a glucuronate (GlcA) residue via a beta1,3-linkage to a terminal galactose to complete the tetrasaccharide linker sequence. The B3GAT3 mutant R277Q causes almost complete loss of activity (3-5% of wt) and results in the production of immature and lower numbers of dermatan sulfate (DS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains (Baasanjav et al. 2011).
