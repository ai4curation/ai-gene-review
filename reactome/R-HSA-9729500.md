display_name: SARS-CoV-2 N binds to 14-3-3 proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 14-3-3 proteins directly shuttle SARS-CoV-1 N protein in a phosphorylation-dependent
  manner from nucleus to cytosol (Surjit et al, 2005). Polyphosphorylated SARS-CoV-2
  N interacts with all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms via its phosphorylated S197. It
  is probable that this results in the shuttling of phosphorylated N from nucleus
  to cytosol. Moreover, 14-3-3 binding to p-N may present a cell immune-like response
  to the viral infection aimed at arresting or neutralizing N activities. On the other
  hand, in light of the abundance of N protein in the infected cell, p-N may instead
  arrest 14-3-3 proteins in the cytoplasm and indirectly disrupt cellular processes
  involving 14-3-3 (Tugaeva et al, 2021).
