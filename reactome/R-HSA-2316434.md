## Summary

A number of different extracellular signals converge on PI3K activation. PI3K can be activated downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as FGFR (Ong et al. 2001, Eswarakumar et al. 2005), KIT (Chian et al. 2001, Ronnstrand 2004, Reber et al. 2006), PDGF (Coughlin et al. 1989, Fantl et al. 1992, Heldin et al. 1998), insulin receptor IGF1R (Hadari et al. 1992, Kooijman et al. 1995), and EGFR and its family members (Rodrigues et al. 2000, Jackson et al. 2004, Kainulainen et al. 2000, Junttila et al. 2009).
