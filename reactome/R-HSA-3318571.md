species: Homo sapiens
summary: MMACHC:B12r (cob(II)alamin, vitamin B12r) binding to methylmalonic aciduria
  and homocystinuria type D protein (MMADHC) represents a branch point in the targeted
  delivery of B12r to either cytosolic or mitochondrial enzymes requiring this cofactor
  (Mah et al. 2013, Plesa et al. 2011, Deme et al. 2012). Both MMACHC and MMADHC are
  implicated in the intracellular transport of cobalamins but exact details of the
  mechanisms involved remain unclear. <br><br>Defects in MMADHC cause methylmalonic
  aciduria and homocystinuria type cblD (MMAHCD; MIM:277410), a disorder of cobalamin
  metabolism characterized by decreased levels of the coenzymes adenosylcobalamin
  (AdoCbl) and methylcobalamin (MeCbl) (Coelho et al. 2008). There are 3 biochemical
  phenotypes for this disorder; sufferers with homocystinuria (mutants L259P, T182N
  and Y249C), methylmalonic aciduria (mutants S20*, and R54*), and combined homocystinuria
  and methylmalonic aciduria (mutants R250* and Y140*) (Coelho et al. 2008, Suormala
  et al. 2004).
