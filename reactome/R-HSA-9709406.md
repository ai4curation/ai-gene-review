stable_id: R-HSA-9709406
display_name: CO binds to Cytochrome c oxidase
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Carbon monoxide (CO) toxicity is the result of a combination of tissue hypoxia
  and direct CO-mediated damage at a cellular level, since not all the signs and symptoms
  presented can be explained only by the formation of carboxyhaemoglobin. CO binds
  to cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal enzyme in the electron transfer chain, reducing
  its activity. Regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is possibly
  one of the key components in CO signaling and its interaction with mitochondria
  but also other heme proteins that generate ROS, such as NADPH oxidase (Alonso et
  al, 2003; Zuckerbraun et al, 2007; Ishigami et al, 2017; Motterlini and Foresti,
  2017).
