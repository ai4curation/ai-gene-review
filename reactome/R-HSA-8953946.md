summary: The RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase sub-complex PEX2:PEX10:PEX12 catalyzes
  the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2-ubiquitin conjugate (one of Ub:UBE2D1, Ub:UBE2D2,
  or Ub:UBE2D3) to the cysteine-11 residue of the substrate PEX5L, the peroxisomal
  matrix protein shuttling receptor (Carvalho et al. 2007; Grou et al. 2008, Okumoto
  et al. 2011, Sargent et al. 2016, inferred from yeast in Dodt and Gould 1996). The
  thiol ester bond between ubiquitin and the cysteine residue of PEX5 is unusual among
  ubiquitin substrates, which usually have isopeptide bonds between ubiquitin and
  a lysine residue. Monoubiquitination of PEX5 at cysteine-11 is an integral and mandatory
  step in the PEX5-mediated peroxisomal protein transport pathway; in its absence,
  PEX5 cannot be extracted from the peroxisomal membrane docking/translocation machinery
  (the peroxisomal protein translocon), and thus transport of newly synthesized peroxisomal
  matrix proteins to the organelle matrix stops (Grou et al. 2009). In addition to
  monoubiquitinating PEX5 during peroxisomal protein import, the PEX2:PEX10:PEX12
  complex has also been implicated in pexophagy, a type of selective autophagy targeting
  peroxisomes. Pexophagy seems to be triggered mainly by ubiquitination of PEX5, which,
  in this case, can occur either at its cysteine-11 or lysine-209 residues, but ubiquitination
  of ABCD3 (also known as PMP70) and other peroxisomal membrane proteins may also
  be involved (Zhang et al. 2015, inferred from mouse in Nordgren et al. 2015, Sargent
  et al. 2016).
