summary: The TAK1 complex consists of Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB)-activated
  kinase (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1), TAB2 and TAB3. TAK1 requires TAB1
  for its kinase activity (Shibuya et al. 1996, Sakurai et al. 2000). TAB1 promotes
  TAK1 autophosphorylation at the kinase activation lobe, probably through an allosteric
  mechanism (Brown et al. 2005, Ono et al. 2001). The TAK1 complex is regulated by
  polyubiquitination. Binding of TAB2 and TAB3 to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains
  leads to the activation of TAK1 by an uncertain mechanism. Binding of multiple TAK1
  complexes to the same polyubiquitin chain may promote oligomerization of TAK1, facilitating
  TAK1 autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of its kinase activity (Kishimoto
  et al. 2000). The binding of TAB2/3 to polyubiquitinated TRAF6 may facilitate polyubiquitination
  of TAB2/3 by TRAF6 (Ishitani et al. 2003), which might result in conformational
  changes within the TAK1 complex that lead to TAK1 activation. Another possibility
  is that TAB2/3 may recruit the IKK complex by binding to ubiquitinated NEMO; polyubiquitin
  chains may function as a scaffold for higher order signaling complexes that allow
  interaction between TAK1 and IKK (Kanayama et al. 2004).

## Summary

The TAK1 complex consists of Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB)-activated kinase (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1), TAB2 and TAB3.
