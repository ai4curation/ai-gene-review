stable_id: R-HSA-5685604
display_name: SLAMF6 binds SLAMF6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Members of the signaling lymphocytic-activation molecule (SLAM) family, are
  all encoded in the SLAM locus, and are mostly homotypic self-associating receptors
  expressed by cells of hemopoietic origin (Veillette et al. 2006). SLAMF6 (also called
  as NTB-A) is a homophilic receptor that stimulates cytotoxicity in natural killer
  (NK) cells, regulates bactericidal activities in neutrophils, and potentiates T
  helper 2 (Th2) responses (Cao et al. 2006).
