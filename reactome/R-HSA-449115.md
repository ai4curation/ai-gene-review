display_name: IL15:IL15RA binds IL2RB:JAK1 and IL2RG:JAK3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Interleukin-15 (IL15) / Interleukin-15 receptor subunit alpha (IL15RA,
  IL15Rα) complex binds Interleukin-2 receptor subunit beta (IL2RB, IL2Rβ), which
  is associated with Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and Cytokine receptor common
  subunit gamma (IL2RG, IL2Rγ), which is associated with Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK3
  (JAK3) (Johnston et al. 1995). The heterodimer of IL2RB and IL2RG can bind IL15
  with low affinity but high affinity binding requires a third component, IL15RA (Giri
  et al. 1994, 1995, Anderson et al. 1995). This is a Black Box Event because it is
  not clear whether the beta and gamma subunits pre-associate before binding IL15:IL15RA.
