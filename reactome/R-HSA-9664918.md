species: Homo sapiens
summary: Many EGFR-binding ERBB2 KD mutants were shown to activate PI3K/AKT signaling,
  as evidenced by activating phosphorylation of AKT in the presence of these ERBB2
  KD mutants. Phosphorylated heterodimers of the following ERBB2 KD mutants with EGFR
  are assumed to, like the wild type ERBB2:EGFR heterodimer, bind to the GRB2:GAB1
