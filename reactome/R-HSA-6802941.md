display_name: RAF is paradoxically phosphorylated downstream of kinase-inactive RAF
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The enhanced dimerization of inhibited or kinase dead versions of BRAF to
  RAF1/CRAF stimulates the phosphorylation and transactivation of RAF1 (Wan et al,
  2004; Garnett et al, 2005; Heidorn et al, 2010; Poulikakos et al, 2010; Hatzivassiliou
  et al, 2010; reviewed in Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014; Lavoie and Therrien, 2015).  Other
  evidence suggests that paradoxical activation of RAF1 by inhibited or inactive BRAF
  may result from relief of an inhibitory CRAF autophosphorylation event (Holderfield
  et al, 2013; reviewed in Holderfield, 2014).

## Summary

Other evidence suggests that paradoxical activation of RAF1 by inhibited or inactive BRAF may result from relief of an inhibitory CRAF autophosphorylation event (Holderfield et al, 2013; reviewed in Holderfield, 2014).
