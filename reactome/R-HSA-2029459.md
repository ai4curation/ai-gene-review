display_name: Sequestering and phosphorylation Fc gamma receptors in the lipid rafts
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After cross linking, Fc gamma receptors are sequestered to lipid rafts where
  they are complexed with some of the tyrosine kinases of Src family and undergo phosphorylation
  on the tyrosine residues contained in conserved ITAM sequences. At least six out
  of nine members of the Src family kinases (SRC, FYN, FGR, HCK, YES and LYN ) have
  been identified in the phagocytic cells and are implicated in the initiation of
  Fc gamma mediated signaling. (Suzuki et al. 2000, Majeed et al. 2001, Kwiatkowska
  et al. 2003). Some of these kinases have been found associated with specific receptors.
  In monocytes HCK and LYN have been found associated with FCGRI (Durden et al. 1995),
  whereas only HCK with FCGRIIA (Ghazizadeh et al. 1994) while FGR in neutrophils
  (Hamada et al. 1993) and LCK in NK cells with FCGRIIIA (Pignata et al. 1993) <br>The
  implication of Src kinases in phosphorylation was first supported by pharmacological
  findings that herbimycin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor relatively specific for
  Src-family kinases, potently suppressed Fc receptor mediated functions (Greenberg
  et al. 1993, Suzuki et al. 2000). However, their particular involvement in phagocytosis
  remains unclear, as targeted disruption of single or multiple Src family genes did
  not result in significant alterations in phagocytosis (Hunter et al. 1993, Fitzer
  Attas et al. 2000, Suzuki et al. 2000). HCK, FGR and LYN triple-deficient (-/-)

  residues Y288 and Y304 (Y282 and Y298 according to the literature reference, it

  sites that are phosphorylated by Src family kinases (Mitchell et al, 1994). In case
