display_name: Binding of Malectin
species: Homo sapiens
summary: A recently discovered protein called malectin is known to recognize the Glc(2)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)
  glycan (Schallus T et al, 2008). The exact role of this interaction is not clear
  but malectin is thought to regulate the availability of  this substrate to glucosidase
  II, or to act as a chaperone to stabilize the unfolded protein.
