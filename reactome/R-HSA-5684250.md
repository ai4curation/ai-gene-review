display_name: 'SCF betaTrCP ubiquitinates NFKB p105 within p-S927, S932-NFkB p105:TPL2:ABIN2 '
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Beta-TrCP ubiquitinates p105 at several lysine residues within the C-terminal
  region 660-968. The level of ubiquitination is variable; in this reaction p105 is
  represented with 3 ubiquitinated lysine residues. Removal of all lysines within
  this region abolishes subsequent p105 degradation.
