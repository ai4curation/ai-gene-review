summary: Interleukin-23 (IL23) is a complex of Interleukin-23 subunit alpha (IL23A)
  and Interleukin-12 subunit beta (IL12B, IL-12p40). IL12B is also a component of
  Interleukin-12 (IL12) (Oppmann et al. 2000, Lupardus & Garcia et al. 2008).<br>The
  Interleukin-23 receptor consists of Interleukin 23 receptor subunit (IL23R) and
  Interleukin 12 receptor subunit beta 1 (IL12RB1). IL12RB1 is shared with the Interleukin-12
  receptor. <br>The Interleukin-23 receptor binds IL23 but does not interact with
  IL12. IL12RB1 is required to confer IL23 responsiveness in cells (Parham et al.
  2002).  <br>IL23 is produced by antigen presenting cells and promotes the expansion
  and survival of a distinct lineage of T cells called T helper 17 (Th17) (Langrish
  et al. 2005). Increasing evidence supports the idea that Th17 cells do not require
  traditional T helper 1(Th1) or T helper 2 (Th2) transcription factors or regulatory
  genes, and that their differentiation is inhibited by Interferon-gamma (IFNG) and
  Interleukin 4 (IL4) (Hoeve et al. 2006). <br>Naive T cells cultured in the presence
  of Transforming growth factor beta 1(TGFB1) and Interleukin 6 (IL6) and in the absence
  of IFNG or IL4 are polarized to Th17 cells and upregulate IL23R (Veldhoen et al.
  2006).<br><br>Subsequently, IL23 appears to be required for the expansion and survival
  of Th17 cells. Like Th1 and Th2 cells, Th17 cells remain committed to their lineage,
  even in the presence of other Th polarizing cytokines (Harrington et al. 2005).
  <br>The Interleukin 23 receptor ligand interaction has been shown to activate Signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), resulting in binding to the
  Interleukin 17A(IL17A) and Interleukin 17F (IL17F) promoters. The T cell response

  signaling 3 (SOCS3), which acts as a feedback inhibitor to regulate Th17 cells (Chen
  et al. 2006).<br><br>Knockout mice deficient in either IL12B or IL23A, or in either

  in these inflammatory diseases (Kikly et al. 2006). <br>As it is not clear whether
  the dimeric receptor can form in the absence of ligand, formation of the receptor
