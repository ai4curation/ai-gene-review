stable_id: R-HSA-9012208
display_name: miR-26A and B bind to the 3'UTR of the KPNA2 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Translation of KPNA2 mRNA is negatively regulated by mIR-26A and B, which
  bind directly to the 3'UTR. mIR-26A and B are both downregulated in the presence
  of estrogen in a manner that depends on estrogen-stimulated MYC gene expression.
  Of the nine identified estrogen-responsive, mIR-26 regulated genes, GREB1, CHD1
  and KPNA2 are the only three that contribute to the proliferative response to estrogen
  (Tan et al, 2014). KPNA2 expression has also been demonstrated to be regulated by
  mIR-26 binding in ovarian cancer (Lin et al 2015).
