stable_id: R-HSA-174445
display_name: RPA binds to the Flap on the C-strand
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The first step in the removal of the flap intermediate is the binding of
  Replication Protein A (RPA) to the long flap structure. RPA is a eukaryotic single-stranded
  DNA binding protein (Bae et al. 2001). Binding of RPA to the single strand DNA during
  telomeric strand displacement synthesis is necessary for the recruitment of DNA2.
  DNA2 is a helicase/endonuclease that resolves G quadruplexes (G4), which are DNA
  structures that commonly form in polyguanine-rich telomeric DNA sequences (Masuda-Sasa
  et al. 2008). DNA2 also removes the initiator RNA primers of Okazaki fragments (Bae
  et al. 2001).
