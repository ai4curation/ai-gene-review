stable_id: R-HSA-379848
display_name: phenylalanine + tRNA(Phe) + ATP => Phe-tRNA(Phe) + AMP + pyrophosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FARS (cytosolic phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase) catalyzes the reaction of phenylalanine,
  tRNA(Phe), and ATP to form Phe-tRNA(Phe), AMP, and pyrophosphate. The enzyme, a
  class II tRNA synthetase, is a heterotetramer of two alpha and two beta subunits
  (Moor et al. 2002).
