stable_id: R-HSA-879674
display_name: CD97 binds CD55
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CD55 (or Decay Accelerating Factor; DAF) is a member of the regulators of
  complement activation (RCA) family. It protects host cells from complement system
  attack by binding to C3b and C4b preventing formation of the membrane attack complex.
  CD97 is a member of the Adhesion class or LNB subfamily of family B GPCRs, characterized
  by long N-terminal regions containing domains contain multiple tandem epidermal
  growth factor (EGF)-like repeats in their N-termini (Foord et al. 2002). CD97 is
  constitutively expressed on granulocytes and monocytes and is rapidly up-regulated
  on activated T and B cells. It is known to have many splice forms containing different
  numbers of EGF domains, consequently binding CD55 with differing affinities. The
  highest affinity variant has three EGF domains. The leukocyte-restricted expression
  pattern of CD97, and the presence of both CD97 and CD55 in arthritic joints suggest
  a possible role in adhesion and signaling within the inflammatory and immune responses
  (Lin et al. 2001).
