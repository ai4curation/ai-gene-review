stable_id: R-HSA-1592231
display_name: Expression of CYCS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The gene encoding cytochrome c (CYCS) is transcribed in the nucleus to yield
  mRNA and the mRNA is translated in the cytosol to yield the precursor of cytochrome
  c, which is then imported into the mitochodrial matrix and associates with the matrix
  face of the inner membrane.
