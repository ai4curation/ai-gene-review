display_name: CTBP1,CTBP2 binds CDH1 gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CTBP1 (Cowger et al. 2007, Bruton et al. 2008; Deng et al. 2012) and CTBP2
  (Zhao et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2011), known to function as homo- or heterodimers
  (Shi et al. 2003), bind to the CDH1 gene promoter, likely in association with other
  transcription factors, such as ZEB1 (Shi et al. 2003; Ichikawa et al. 2015; Zou
  et al. 2024) or ZNF217 (Cowger et al. 2007; Bruton et al. 2008).
