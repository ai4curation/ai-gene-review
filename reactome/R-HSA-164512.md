stable_id: R-HSA-164512
display_name: Second strand transfer by annealing complementary PBS sequences
species: Homo sapiens
summary: With the removal of all viral genomic RNA and tRNA, the PBS sequence at the
  3' end of the plus-strand strong-stop DNA (+sssDNA) is free to pair with the complementary
  PBS sequence at the 3' end of the minus-strand DNA, to generate a circular structure
  (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997).

## Summary

With the removal of all viral genomic RNA and tRNA, the PBS sequence at the 3' end of the plus-strand strong-stop DNA (+sssDNA) is free to pair with the complementary PBS sequence at the 3' end of the minus-strand DNA, to generate a circular structure (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997).
