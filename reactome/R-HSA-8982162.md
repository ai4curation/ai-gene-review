display_name: p‑Y705-STAT3 dissociates from IL19:IL20RA:p-JAK1:IL20RB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is believed to
  dissociate from the Interleukin-19 (IL19) receptor complex after phosphorylation.
  The Interleukin-19 receptor complex is formed by Interleukin-20 receptor A (IL20RA)
  associated with Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) and Interleukin-20 receptor
  B (IL20RB). This is a black box event because dissociation of STAT3 from the IL19
  receptor is inferred from IL-19 induced changed in STA3 regulated gene expression
  (Tian et al. 2008).
