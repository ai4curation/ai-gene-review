display_name: Importin-8 imports AGO2:miRNA into the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The AGO2:miRNA complex is formed in the cytosol (Ohrt et al 2008) and is
  imported into the nucleus via the nuclear pore in a complex with Importin-8 (IPO8,
  Imp8, RanBP8) (Weinmann et al. 2009, Wei et al. 2014). Once in the nucleus, Imp8
  in complex with the cargo interacts with RAN:GTP, causing the dissociation of Imp8
  from the complex with AGO2:miRNA (Gorlich et al. 1997). Other Argonautes are also
  observed in the nucleus (Robb et al. 2005, Weinmann et al. 2009, Doyle et al. 2013,
  Ahlenstiel et al. 2012, Gagnon et al. 2014) and may be imported by the same mechanism.
