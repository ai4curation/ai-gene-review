stable_id: R-HSA-9856627
display_name: ATF5 and HSF1 trimer activate expression of HSPA9 (mtHSP70)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: During the mitochondrial response to unfolded protein (mtUPR), a reduction
  of mitochondrial protein import causes ATF5 to accumulate in the nucleus and activate
  expression of the mitochondrial chaperone HSPA9 (mtHSP70) (Fiorese et al. 2016).
  Trimeric Heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1) phosphorylated on serine-326 is also
  required for expression of HSPA9 during the mtUPR (Sutandy et al. 2023, inferred
  from mouse homologs in Katiyar et al. 2020).

## Summary

During the mitochondrial response to unfolded protein (mtUPR), a reduction of mitochondrial protein import causes ATF5 to accumulate in the nucleus and activate expression of the mitochondrial chaperone HSPA9 (mtHSP70) (Fiorese et al. 2016). Trimeric Heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1) phosphorylated on serine-326 is also required for expression of HSPA9 during the mtUPR (Sutandy et al. 2023, inferred from mouse homologs in Katiyar et al. 2020).
