display_name: Activated BRAF phosphorylates MAP2K dimers downstream of RAP1 and NGF
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Downstream of NGF stimulation, activated BRAF phosphorylates MAP2K1 and MAP2K2
  (MEK1 and MEK2) at the endosome, leading to sustained MAPK signaling (York et al,
  1998; Kao et al, 2001; reviewed in Huang and Reichardt, 2003; Reichardt, 2006).
