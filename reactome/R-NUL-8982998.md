display_name: Stat3 binds IL7R:TSLP:CRLF2
species: Mus musculus
summary: The receptor for Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) consists of  Cytokine
  receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2, TSLPR) and Interleukin-7 receptor subunit alpha (IL7R).
  Following binding of TSLP Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A or
  5B (STAT5A and STAT5B, or as a brief STAT5) and Signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3) are phosphorylated (in Ba/F3 cell line).<br>Phosphorylation
  of STAT5 and STAT3 by human TSLP has only been detected on cells expressing both
  receptors IL7R and TSLPR (Reche et al.2001).<br>This is a black box event since
  there are no experimental details confirming binding of STAT3 and STAT5 to the receptor
  complex.
