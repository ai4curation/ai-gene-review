display_name: Unknown peptidase cleaves UQCRFS1 subunit
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Proteolytic processing is necessary for the correct insertion of UQCRFS1
  in the complex III dimer. An unknown peptidase cleaves the N-terminal 78 amino acids
  of UQCRFS1, producing several unspecified N-terminal fragments that remain in the
  complex until cleared by TTC19. Possible candidates for the peptidase are the UQCRC1
  and UQCRC2 subunits (as hinted at in the cattle model) or the SPY complex (Bottani
  et al., 2017; Fernandez-Vizarra & Zeviani, 2018).
