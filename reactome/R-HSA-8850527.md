display_name: PDCL releases folded G-beta from TRiC/CCT
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PDCL (PhLP1) enables completion of folding of G-protein beta subunits 1-4
  (GNB1, GNB2, GNB3 and GNB4) by the TRiC/CCT chaperonin, resulting in the release
  of dimers of PDCL and folded G-protein beta 1-4 (Lukov et al. 2005, Lukov et al.
  2006, Howlett et al. 2009, Plimpton et al. 2015).
