species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH3 catalyzes the irreversible reaction
  of isocitrate and NAD+ to form alpha-ketoglutarate, CO2, and NADH. The enzyme is
  a heterooctamer containing two copies of a heterotetramer of two IDH3A, one IDH3B,
  one IDH3G, and two Mn++ (PDB 7CE3; Sun et al., 2020; Dange and Colman, 2010). It
  is activated by ADP (Soundar et al., 2003, 2006; Bzymek and Colman, 2007) and inhibited
  by NADH and high concentrations of ATP (Cohen & Colman, 1972; Sun et al., 2020).
  This is the first of four oxidation reactions in the citric acid cycle and the first
  decarboxylation.<br><br>Mutations in the IDH3A, IDH3B gene can cause retinitis pigmentosa
