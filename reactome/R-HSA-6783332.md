stable_id: R-HSA-6783332
display_name: APP(672-713),APP(672-711) translocate from endosome lumen to extracellular
  region
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Abeta peptides 42 and 40 (APP(672-713) and APP(673-711) respectively)
  are thought to be the main fibril-forming peptides implicated in neurodegenerative
  disorders. They translocate from the endosomal lumen to the extracellular region
  by an unknown mechanism (Qui et al. 2015, Baranello et al. 2015).
