display_name: Dissociation of beta-catenin from Axin and association of beta catenin
  with phospho-(20 aa) APC in the detruction complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The phosphorylation of the 20 aa repeats in APC results in an increase in
  affinity for beta-catenin  (Ha et al., 2004, Xing et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006).
  The binding site of phospho -(20 aa) APC on beta-catenin overlaps the binding site
  of Axin on beta catenin. In addition, phosphorylated APC prevents the association
  of Axin with beta-catenin (Ha et al., 2004, Xing et al., 2004). In this model,  phosphorylated
  APC may compete with Axin for beta-catenin binding, resulting in dissociation of
  the Axin:beta-catenin interaction in the destruction complex (see Kimelman and Xu
  2006).

## Summary

The binding site of phospho -(20 aa) APC on beta-catenin overlaps the binding site of Axin on beta catenin. In addition, phosphorylated APC prevents the association of Axin with beta-catenin (Ha et al., 2004, Xing et al., 2004).
