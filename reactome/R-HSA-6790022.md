species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a key regulator
  of gene expression in response to signaling of many cytokines including interleukin-6
  (IL6), Oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Using microarray techniques,
  hundreds of genes have been reported as potential STAT3 target genes (Dauer et al.
  2005, Hsieh et al. 2005). Some of these genes have been proven to be direct STAT3
  targets using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation screening (Snyder et al.
  2008, Carpenter & Lo 2014). Genes for plasma membrane proteins that are upregulated
  by STAT3 include Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) (Scuringa et al. 2001),
  Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1B (TNFRSF1B, TNFR2) (Hamilton
  et al. 2011), Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1, EDG1) (Lee et al. 2010),
  Interleukin-6 receptor subunit alpha (IL6R), Interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) (Durant
  et al. 2010) and Mucin-1 (MUC1) (Gaemers et al. 2001).

## Summary

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a key regulator of gene expression in response to signaling of many cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL6), Oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Using microarray techniques, hundreds of genes have been reported as potential STAT3 target genes (Dauer et al. 2005, Hsieh et al. 2005). Some of these genes have been proven to be direct STAT3 targets using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation screening (Snyder et al. 2008, Carpenter & Lo 2014). Genes for plasma membrane proteins that are upregulated by STAT3 include Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) (Scuringa et al. 2001), Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1B (TNFRSF1B, TNFR2) (Hamilton et al. 2011), Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1, EDG1) (Lee et al. 2010), Interleukin-6 receptor subunit alpha (IL6R), Interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) (Durant et al. 2010) and Mucin-1 (MUC1) (Gaemers et al. 2001).
