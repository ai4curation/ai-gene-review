display_name: Degradation of HSPG2 by Mmp13 and Ctss
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The GAG chains of HSPG2 bind growth factors in the ECM, and serve as co-ligands
  or ligand enhancers when bound to receptors. For example, HS-bound FGF was released
  from cultured cells by treatments with MMP3, rat MMP13, and plasmin (Whitelock et
  al. 1996).  The core protein of HSPG2 can be cleaved by rat cathepsin S (Liuzzo
  et al. 1999).
