display_name: Formation of energy-dependent Nucleolar Silencing Complex (eNoSC)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RRP8 (Nucleomethylin, NML), SIRT1, and SUV39H1 form the energy-dependent
  Nucleolar Silencing Complex (eNoSC) at inactive rRNA genes (Murayama et al. 2008).
  RRP8 is constitutively located in the nucleolus (Yang et al. 2013), binds histone
  H3 dimethylated at lysine-9 (Murayama et al. 2008) and appears to recruit SIRT1
  from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus (Yang et al. 2013). The eNoSC binds chromatin
  throughout the rRNA transcription unit. SIRT1 may deacetylate and, hence, activate
  SUV39H1 but this has not yet been shown at rDNA. Abrogation of any member of eNoSC
  interferes with binding of the other members of the complex. The eNoSC complex appears
  to cause spreading of heterochromatin at rDNA.
