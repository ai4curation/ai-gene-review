summary: Binding of TNFα to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) induces the sequential formation
  of several signaling complexes, namely complex I and complex IIa/b (Walczak H 2011;
  Yuan J et al. 2019). These complexes support either cell survival (complex I) or
  cell death (complex II). The assembly of these complexes is tightly regulated by
  proteolysis, ubiquitination and phosphorylation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine
  protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and other components of the TNFα signaling pathway (reviewed
  in Yuan J et al. 2019; Varfolomeev E & Vucic D 2022). RIPK1 functions as a key regulator
  of both cell survival and cell death (reviewed in Ju E et al. 2022). Enzymatically
  inactive polyubiquitin-bound RIPK1 serves as a scaffold in the TNFR1 signaling complex
  (complex I) to recruit TAK1 kinase complex and I-kappa-B kinase (IKK) complex contributing
  to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-kappa-B signaling
  pathways, which regulate expression of pro-survival and inflammatory genes. Deubiquitination
  of RIPK1 leads to the activation of RIPK1 kinase activity, which promotes RIPK1
  kinase-dependent cell death (reviewed in Ju E et al. 2022). Several deubiquitinating
  enzymes, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, known as
  Zn finger protein A20) or ubiquitin (Ub) carboxyl-terminal hydrolase CYLD, have
  been implicated in the regulation of RIPK1 activity. CYLD disassembles both Met1-
  and Lys63-polyUb chains (Fiil BK et al. 2013; Harhaj EW and Dixit VM 2012; Hrdinka
  M et al. 2016; Sato Y 2022). Upon TNFα stimulation, CYLD is recruited to the TNFR1
  signaling complex along with the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC).
  Interaction of CYLD with LUBAC is facilitated by spermatogenesis-associated protein
  2 (SPATA2) (Elliott PR et al. 2016; Kupka S et al. 2016; Schlicher L et al. 2016;

  the TNFR1 signaling complex to regulate ubiquitination/deubiquitination downstream
  of TNFR1 (Wagner SA et al. 2016; Elliott PR et al. 2016; Kupka S et al. 2016; Schlicher
