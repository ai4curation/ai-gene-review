stable_id: R-HSA-9725009
display_name: NPM1-ALK translocates to the nucleus
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Unique so far among ALK fusion proteins, NPM1-ALK is partially nuclear in
  localization. Endogenous full length NPM is a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein
  that contains a nuclear localization signal; although this domain is not conserved
  in the NPM-ALK fusion, nuclear localization of NPM-ALK is believed to be facilitated
  by oligomerization with full-length NPM, which exists in dimeric and pentameric
  states (Kim et al, 2015; reviewed in Box et al ,2006; Okuwaki, 2007; Ducray et al,
  2019). Partial nuclear localization of NPM-ALK allows it to perform roles in transcriptional
  and epigenetic regulation (reviewed in Ducray et al, 2019).
