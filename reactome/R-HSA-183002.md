display_name: Beta-Pix:CDC42:GTP binds CBL in EGF:p-6Y-EGFR:CBL:CIN85
species: Homo sapiens
summary: High concentrations of active CDC42 (bound to GTP) and Beta-Pix may promote
  the binding of Beta-Pix to CBL, pushing out the usually preferred binding partner
  CIN85 (SH3KBP1) from the CBL complex. This competitive mechanism could block the
  CIN85-imposed clustering phenomenon on CBL that is required for tighter binding
  (Schmidt et al. 2006).

## Summary

This competitive mechanism could block the CIN85-imposed clustering phenomenon on CBL that is required for tighter binding (Schmidt et al. 2006).
