display_name: CHM binds RGGT
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'RAB escort protein CHM (REP1) binds the RAB geranylgeranyl transferase complex,
  RGGT, composed of RABGGTA and RABGGTB (Baron and Seabra 2008). The interaction between
  CHM and the RGGT complex is enhanced by the presence of phosphoisoprenoids (Thoma
  et al. 2001). The complex of RGGT and CHM catalyzes geranylgeranylation of small
  GTPases RAB1A, RAB3A and RAB5A, which is needed for the membrane localization of
  RABs (Farnsworth et al. 1994). RAB geranylgeranyl transferase can play an anti-apoptotic
  role, through an unknown mechanism (Lackner et al. 2005). RAB5A, the substrate of
  RGGT:CHM complex, was shown to positively regulate formation of autophagosomes (Li
  et al. 2013). '
