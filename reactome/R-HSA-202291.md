species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The binding of CD4/CD8 to non-polymorphic regions of MHC brings Lck in to
  proximity with TCR subunits phosphorylation. Lck is further phosphorylated to promote
  the active conformation and to increase their catalytic activity. The C-term domain
  contain a regulatory activation loop, which is the site of activating Tyr 394 phosphorylation.
  This tyrosine is auto-phosphorylated to attain an active conformation on TCR stimulation.
  Now Lck through its kinase activity phosphorylates the ITAMs in TCR zeta and CD3
  members. '
