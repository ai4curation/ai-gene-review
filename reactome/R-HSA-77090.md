species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the final step of the capping reaction, the methyltransferase takes a
  methyl group from S-adenosyl-methionine to the N7 position of the cap guanine. N7G-methyltransferase
  (MT) mediated reaction can be represented as:<BR>GpppN(pN)n + S-adenosylmethionine
  (Adomet) ->m7GpppN(pN)n + S-adenosylhomocysteine (Adohcy).<P>
