display_name: General transcription factors bind SNAPc:POU2F1:ZNF143:snRNA gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The promoter of an snRNA gene binds the basal transcription factors TFIIA,
  TFIIB (GTF2B), TFIIE, and TFIIF (Bernues et al. 1993, Kuhlman et al. 1999). Rather
  than the TFIID complex found at promoters of mRNA-encoding genes, a unique complex
  containing TBP (Sadowski et al. 1993) and snTAFc is present at promoters of snRNA
  genes (Zaborowska et al. 2012). The P-TEFb complex is also observed at snRNA genes,
  however, it seems to play a role more in 3' processing than in elongation (Medlin
  et al. 2005). CDK7 is also present and phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA
  polymerase II (Glover-Cutter et al. 2009).
