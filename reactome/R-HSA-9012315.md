display_name: ESR1:ESTG:P-TEFb recruited to paused RNA polymerase II on MYB gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MYB is frequently expressed in breast cancer and its expression is correlated
  with ER positive tumors (Guerin et al, 1990; Kauraniemi et al, 2000). MYB expression
  is estrogen-responsive, but hormone-dependent control is exerted at the level of
  transcriptional elongation rather than initiation (Frasor et al, 2003; Carroll et
  al, 2006; Bender et al, 1987; Watson et al, 1988; Drabsch et al, 2007).  In the
  absence of estrogen, RNA polymerase II stalls at a stem-loop poly-T (SL-dT) tract
  between within intron 1 (Drabsch et al, 2007). Upon estrogen stimulation, a complex
  containing estrogen, the estrogen receptor and P-TEFb (an elongation factor consisting
  of Cyclin T and CDK9) is recruited to an ERE near the SL-dT. P-TEFb phosphorylates
  serine 2 in the RNA polymerase II CTD, allowing the polymerase to continue elongating
  (Drabsch et al, 2007; Mitra et al, 2012; reviewed in Gonda et al, 2008; Garriga
  and Grana, 2004). Although EREs have been identified around the SL-dT and have been
  shown by ChIP to be bound by ESR1, mutation of the EREs does not abrogate estrogen-responsive
  MYB expression, suggesting that the estrogen receptor either binds to a non-canonical
  site or it interacts through another transcription factor in this reaction (Drabsch
  et al, 2007; Mitra et al, 2012)

## Summary

MYB is frequently expressed in breast cancer and its expression is correlated with ER positive tumors (Guerin et al, 1990; Kauraniemi et al, 2000).
