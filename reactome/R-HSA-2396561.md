display_name: Recruitment of GADS:SLP-76 to p-5Y-LAT
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Gads/GRAP2 (GRB2-related adapter protein 2) is member of the GRB2 adaptor
  family with a central SH2 domain and linker region flanked by amino- and carboxy-terminal
  SH3 domains. SLP-76 associates constitutively via its central 20-amino acid proline-rich
  domain with the C-terminal SH3 domain of Gads, which recruits it to LAT following
  receptor stimulation. Upon LAT phosphorylation, Gads:SLP-76 complex principally
  binds to phosphorylated LAT tyrosine 191, with a reduced amount of binding to phosphorylated
  tyrosine 171 and no interaction with phosphorylated tyrosines 132 or 226 (Houtman
  et al. 2004, Zhu et al. 2003). Gads may promote cross-talk between the LAT and SLP-76
  signaling complexes, thereby coupling membrane-proximal events to downstream signaling
  pathways (Liu et al. 1999). The LAT-Gads-SLP-76 complex creates a platform for the
  recruitment of multiple signaling molecules, including PLCgamma1, GRB2, NCK, Rho
  GEFs, VAV and the Tec-family kinases ITK and BTK (Liu et al. 1999 & 2001, Asada
  et al. 1999, Yablonski et al. 2001).
