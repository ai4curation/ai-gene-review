stable_id: R-HSA-1888198
display_name: FGFR1OP-FGFR1 phosphorylates STAT1 and STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Expression of FGFR1OP-FGFR1 in both Ba/F3 and Cos-1 cells leads to phosphorylation
  of STAT1 and STAT3 but not STAT5, and to activation of a STAT1/3-responsive reporter
  when expressed in NIH3T3 cells (Guasch, 2001).  Activation of STAT proteins has
  also been shown to be oncogenic in the context of derivatives of FGFR1, 3 and 4
  that lack the extracellular domain and are are targetted to the plasma membrane
  by a myristylation signal (Hart et al, 2000).
