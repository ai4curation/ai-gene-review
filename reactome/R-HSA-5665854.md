display_name: ADRM1:26S proteaseome binds UCHL5
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The C-terminal extension of UCHL5 (UCH37) binds to ADRM1, part of the proteasomal
  19S regulatory subunit which is itself a subunit of the 26S proteasome. Binding
  of UCHL5 enhances its DUB activity (Qiu et al. 2006). UCHL5 forms oligomers in solution
  that have very low DUB activity. Binding with ADRM1 is 1:1, preventing oligomerization
  of UCHL5 while making the active site of UCHL5 accessible to Ubiquitin (Jiao et
  al. 2014). When associated with the proteasome, UCHL5 disassembles poly-Ub chains
  by hydrolyzing the distal ubiquitin from a chain. This dissassembly of the degradation
  signal from only the distal end of polyubiquitin chains may selectively rescue poorly
  ubiquitinated or slowly degraded Ub-protein conjugates from proteolysis (Lam et
  al. 1997). '
