summary: 'Once phosphorylated, PLC-gamma 1 is expected to dissociate from phosphorylated
  EGFR cancer mutants and induce downstream signaling in the same way it does when

  binding site in EGFR cancer mutants, other events involved in activation of PLCG1
  signaling have not been studied in cells expressing EGFR cancer mutants. '

## Summary

Once phosphorylated, PLC-gamma 1 is expected to dissociate from phosphorylated EGFR cancer mutants and induce downstream signaling in the same way it does when activated by the wild-type EGFR. However, except for the phosphorylation of PLCG1 binding site in EGFR cancer mutants, other events involved in activation of PLCG1 signaling have not been studied in cells expressing EGFR cancer mutants.
