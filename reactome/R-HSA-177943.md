stable_id: R-HSA-177943
display_name: GRB2:SOS1 complex binds to EGF:EGFR complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cytoplasmic target proteins containing the SH2 domain can bind to activated
  EGFR. One such protein, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), can bind
  activated EGFR with its SH2 domain whilst in complex with SOS through its SH3 domain.
  GRB2 can bind at either Y1092 i.e. Y1068 in the mature protein and/or Y1110 i.e.
  Y1086 in the mature protein tyrosine autophosphorylation sites on the receptor.
