species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  dissociates from Interleukin-24 (IL24) activated receptor complex. This activated
  receptor complex is formed by IL24 ligand, Interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-1
  (IL22RA1), phosphorylated Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK) and Interleukin-20
  receptor subunit beta (IL20RB) (Parrish-Novak et al. 2002).

  This is a black box event since there is no direct evidence of this dissociation
  but there is evidence dissociation occurs before translocation in other interleukin
  signaling cascades. '

## Summary

Phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) dissociates from Interleukin-24 (IL24) activated receptor complex. This activated receptor complex is formed by IL24 ligand, Interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL22RA1), phosphorylated Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK) and Interleukin-20 receptor subunit beta (IL20RB) (Parrish-Novak et al. 2002).
This is a black box event since there is no direct evidence of this dissociation but there is evidence dissociation occurs before translocation in other interleukin signaling cascades.
