species: Homo sapiens
summary: G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) sense extracellular signals and activate
  different Guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). Upon activation, GPCRs
  can replace the GDP with GTP in the alpha subunit of G proteins. GTP binding modifies
  the conformation of G alpha proteins and activates them. The Regulator of G protein
  Signalling (RGS) are GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs) that can directly inhibit
  the G alpha subunit activity. There are at least 25 different types of RGS proteins
  known. RGS16, RGS17 and RGS20 can bind and stabilize the transition state of Guanine
  nucleotide binding protein G(z) subunit alpha (GNAZ).  Subsequently, RGS proteins
  in the complex facilitate the hydrolysis of GNAZ:GTP to GNAZ:GDP. Following this,
  the complex dissociates releasing inactive GNAZ ((Neubig & Siderovski 2002, Kach
  et al. 2012, Goto K et al. 2017). GNAZ inhibits adenylyl cyclase and interacts with
  Rap1GAP to attenuate Rap1 signaling.
