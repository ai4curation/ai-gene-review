stable_id: R-RNO-9626239
display_name: Hspa8 binds Lamp2 multimers
species: Rattus norvegicus
summary: Intracellular proteins are targeted for proteolytic degradation in lysosome
  with the aid of chaperones. Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) transports
  substrates from the cytosol to the lysosomal membrane where it binds to Lysosome-associated
  membrane glycoprotein 2 (Lamp2). Subsequently, Lamp2 forms a multimeric complex
  and transfers the substrate into the lumen. The stability of this complex is regulated
  by the dynamics of Hspa8. Cytosolic Hspa8 binds with Lamp2 multimers in the lysosomal
  membrane and triggers their disassembly. Interestingly, substrate bound Hspa8 do
  not have this effect on Lamp2 (Bandyopadhyay U et al. 2008).
