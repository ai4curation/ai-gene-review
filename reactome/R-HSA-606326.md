stable_id: R-HSA-606326
display_name: HJURP:CENPA complex localizes to the centromere
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The HJURP complex binds free, newly synthesized CENPA-H4 tetramers. A direct
  interaction occurs between HJURP and CENPA. The CATD domain of CENPA is sufficient
  for the interaction. The complex then localizes to the centromere in early G1 phase.
  HJURP is required for deposition of new CENPA-containing nucleosomes.
