display_name: LRP2 binds extracellular TCN2:RCbl
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Plasma membrane-associated LRP2 (megalin, glycoprotein 330) complexed with
  LDLRAP1 (Low density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein 1, also known as ARH,
  Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia protein) in renal proximal tubule epithelial
  cells binds TCN2:RCbl (transcobalamin 2 protein bound to cobalamins (RCbl)) (Moestrup
  et al. 1996; Nagai et al. 2003; Shah et al. 2013). LRP2 is a member of the low density
  lipoprotein receptor family (Kounnas et al. 1995, Hjalm et al. 1996).
