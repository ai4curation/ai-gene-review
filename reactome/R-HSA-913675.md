species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The family of UDP GalNAc:polypeptide N acetylgalactosaminyltransferases
  (GalNAc transferases, GALNTs) carry out the addition of N acetylgalactosamine on
  serine, threonine or possibly tyrosine residues on a wide variety of proteins, and
  most commonly associated with mucins (Wandall et al. 1997). This reaction takes
  place in the Golgi apparatus (Rottger et al. 1998). There are 20 known members of
  the GALNT family, 15 of which have been characterised and 5 candidate members which
  are thought to belong to this family based on sequence similarity (Bennett et al.
  2012). The GALNT-family is classified as belonging to CAZy family GT27. The Tn antigen
  is the simplest possible amino acid–carbohydrate glycoconjugate and comprises a
  GalNAc α-O-linked to either serine or threonine. In normal mammalian mucins, GalNAc
  is substituted by Gal, GlcNAc, or GalNAc forming up to eight different core structures.
  The  unsubstituted Tn antigen is often found in cancer and is associated with poor
  prognosis (Kamerling 2007). '
