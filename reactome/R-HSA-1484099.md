display_name: MYC trancscription is negatively regulated by SMAD2/3:SMAD4:RBL1:E2F4/5:DP1/2
  complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Complex formed by RBL1 (p107), E2F4/5, DP1/2 and a trimer of phosphorylated
  R-SMADs (SMAD2/3) and SMAD4 (Co-SMAD) cooperatively binds to TIE (TGF-beta inhibitory
  element) and E2F sites in the MYC promoter and promotes cell-cycle independent inhibition
  of MYC transcription in response to TGF-beta stimulation (Chen et al. 2002).
