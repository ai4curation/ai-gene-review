display_name: Activated DAkt1 phosphorylates TSC2 which inhibits the TSC1/2 complex
species: Drosophila melanogaster
summary: DTSC2 is inactivated by DAkt1-dependent phosphorylation of residues threonine  (1518)
  and serine (924) which is thought to destabilize DTSC2 and disrupt it's interaction
  with DTSC1.
