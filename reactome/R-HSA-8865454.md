stable_id: R-HSA-8865454
display_name: CBFB binds RUNX3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CBFB binds the transcription factor RUNX3, interacting with its Runt domain,
  which is highly similar to Runt domains of RUNX1 and RUNX2 (Kim et al. 2013). RUNX3
  is implicated in neurogenesis, thymopoiesis and stomach development (Inoue et al.
  2002, Levanon et al. 2002, Levanon et al. 2003). RUNX3 and CBFB are frequently downregulated
  in gastric cancer (Sakakura et al. 2005).
