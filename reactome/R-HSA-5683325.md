stable_id: R-HSA-5683325
display_name: Defective ABCD4:LMBRD1 does not transport Cbl from lysosomal lumen to
  cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATP-binding cassette sub-family D member 4 (ABCD4) is thought to mediate
  the lysosomal export of cobalamin (Cbl aka vitamin B12) into the cytosol, making
  it available for the production of Cbl cofactors. Cbl is an important cofactor for
  correct haematological and neurological functions. Defects in ABCD4 can cause methylmalonic
  aciduria and homocystinuria, cblJ type (MAHCJ; MIM:614857), a genetically heterogeneous
  metabolic disorder of Cbl metabolism characterised by decreased levels of the coenzymes
  adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and methylcobalamin (MeCbl). Clinically, symptoms include
  feeding difficulties, poor growth, hypotonia, lethargy, anaemia and delayed development.
  Mutations causing MAHCJ include Y319C and E583Lfs*9 (Coelho et al. 2012).
