display_name: HSPA8-mediated ATP hydrolysis promotes vesicle uncoating
species: Homo sapiens
summary: HSPA8 hydrolyzes ATP to promote dissociation of the clathrin coat from the
  vesicle (reviewed in Sousa and Lafer, 2015). Interaction of HSPA8 with the C-terminal
  tail of clathrin may sterically block re-stabilization of the clathrin coat, which
  is thought to undergo transient cycles of 'breathing', or loosening of the interactions
  between the triskelions (Barouch et al, 1997; Rapoport et al, 2008; Xing et al,
  2010).  Alternately, HSPA8 may destabilize the clathrin coat through intermolecular
  collisions with the coat (reveiwed in Sousa and Lafer, 2015).  The HSPA8-clathrin
  interaction persists once clathrin has been removed from the vesicle. This is thought
  to preclude aberrant repolymerization of clathrin by sequestering free clathrin
  (Schlossman et al, 1984; reviewed in Sousa and Lafer, 2015).
