stable_id: R-HSA-9635892
display_name: ATF4 binds the ATF3 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATF4 binds an amino acid response element (AARE) in the promoter of the ATF3
  gene (Chen et al. 2004, Pan et al. 2007, Fu and Kilberg 2013, Hayner et al. 2018).
  ATF4 initially binds the ATF3 promoter with phosphorylated ATF2, then with JUN (c-Jun),
  then with CEBPB (Fu and Kilberg 2013, Hayner et al. 2018). ATF3 and CEBPB bind later
  and correlate with reduced expression of ATF3 (Pan et al. 2007, Fu and Kilberg 2013,
  Hayner et al. 2018).

ATF4 initially binds the ATF3 promoter with phosphorylated ATF2, then with JUN (c-Jun), then with CEBPB (Fu and Kilberg 2013, Hayner et al. 2018).
