stable_id: R-HSA-727819
display_name: TAK1 phosphorylates MKK6
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Within the TAK1 complex (TAK1 plus TAB1 and TAB2/3) activated TAK1 phosphorylates
  IKKB, MAPK kinase 6 (MKK6) and other MAPKs to activate the NFkappaB and MAPK signaling
  pathways. TAB2 within the TAK1 complex can be linked to polyubiquitinated TRAF6;
  current models of IL-1 signaling suggest that the TAK1 complex is linked to TRAF6,
  itself complexed with polyubiquitinated IRAK1 which is linked via NEMO to the IKK
  complex. The TAK1 complex is also essential for NOD signaling; NOD receptors bind
  RIP2 which recruits the TAK1 complex (Hasegawa et al. 2008).
