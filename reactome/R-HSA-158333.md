display_name: factor IX -> factor IXa + factor IX activation peptide (factor XIa catalyst)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mature factor IX (FIX) is secreted and circulates in the plasma as an inactive
  57kDa zymogen form F9(47-461). Activation of FIX involves cleavage of two peptide
  bonds, at arginine 191 (R191-A192, the α-cleavage) and at arginine 226 (R226-V227,
  the β-cleavage), releasing an activation peptide (A192-R226) (Di Scipio RG et al.
  1978; Zögg T & Brandstetter H 2009). The activation peptide has no known function.
  During the amplification phase of coagulation, this calcium-dependent reaction is
  catalyzed by factor XIa (FXIa), bound to platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib:IX:V on the
  platelet cell surface (Osterud B et al. 1978; Gailani D et al. 2001; Geng Y et al.
  2012). Structural studies suggest that both activation of factor XI and binding
  it to FIX induce conformational changes at the interface between the catalytic and
  the apple domains of the activated FXIa. The conformational changes of FXIa increase
  the accessibility to the apple 3 (A3) domain to enable FIX binding (Geng Y et al.
  2012; Bar Barroeta A et al. 2019). FIX activation is ordered. FIX first binds to
  the FXIa A3 domain followed by engagement at the protease active site and cleavage
  of the R191-Al192 bond (Geng Y et al. 2012, 2013; Gailani D et al. 2014). The cleavage
  after R191 facilitates cleavage of the R226-V227 bond, forming the activated FIXa
  (also known as factor IXaβ). Catalytic efficiency for the second cleavage by FXIa
  is 7-fold greater than for the first cleavage, explaining the low accumulation of
  the α-cleavage product of FIX (Wolberg AS et al. 1997; Smith SB et al. 2008; Geng
  Y et al. 2012; Mohammed BM et al. 2018). Activated FIXa comprises an N-terminal
  light chain and a C-terminal heavy chain held together by a disulphide bridge between
  cysteine resides 178 and 335 (Di Scipio RG et al. 1978; Zögg T & Brandstetter H
  2009). The X-ray structure of the FIXa EGF2/protease domain at 1.37 A revealed that
  a Na+-binding site in association with Ca²⁺-binding site contributed to stabilization
  of the FIXa protease domain (Vadivel K et al. 2019).
