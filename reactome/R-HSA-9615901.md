stable_id: R-HSA-9615901
display_name: AHCTF1 (ELYS) binds chromatin and Nup107-Nup160 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Based on studies in human and Xenopus model systems (Rasala et al. 2006,
  Franz et al. 2007, Gillespie et al. 2007), and C. elegans (Fernandez and Piano 2006)
  model systems, the chromatin binding protein AHCTF1 (ELYS, MEL-28) selectively interacts
  with the Nup107-160 complex and acts as a seeding center for assembly of nuclear
  pore complexes (NPCs) at the chromatin surface in late anaphase/telophase. In the
  absence of AHCTF1, the nuclear envelope can re-assemble but lacks NPCs (Francz et
  al. 2007).
