stable_id: R-HSA-9838004
display_name: LONP1 degrades mitochondrial inner membrane proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After binding a substrate protein, LONP1 degrades the substrate protein using
  an ATP-dependent mechanism in which ATP hydrolysis causes translocation of the substrate
  protein to the protease site (Ambro et al. 2014, Mohammed et al. 2022). LONP1 predominantly
  cleaves peptide bonds adjacent to hydrophobic amino acid residues (He et al. 2018).
  LONP1 binds and degrades several mitochondrial inner membrane proteins (Ondrovicova
  et al. 2005, Lee et al. 2021), including the mitochondrial processing peptidase
  subunit PMPCA (Ondrovicova et al. 2005).
