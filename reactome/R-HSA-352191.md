stable_id: R-HSA-352191
display_name: SLC7A8-mediated uptake of neutral amino acids
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SLC7A8, complexed with SLC3A2 in the plasma membrane, mediates the uptake
  of neutral amino acids. The process is Na+-independent and not coupled to H+ transport.
  As measured by Northern blotting SLC7A8 is widely expressed in the body. In situ
  hybridization studies indicate that the gene product is abundant in kidney proximal
  tubules (Pineda et al. 1999; Park et al. 2005)
