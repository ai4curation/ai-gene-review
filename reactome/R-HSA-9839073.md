display_name: HTRA2 binds NDUFA13 (GRIM-19)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NDUFA13 (GRIM-19), a subunit of mitochondrial respiratory complex I, binds
  HTRA2 (OMI), a serine protease, in the mitochondrion and promotes apoptotic activity
  of HTRA2 (Ma et al. 2007, Kummari et al. 2021). The binding of NDUFA13 allosterically
  activates the protease activity of HTRA2, which then cleaves NDUFA13 at six sites
  (Kummari et al. 2012). Activated HTRA2 also cleaves XIAP to enhance apoptosis (Ma
  et al. 2007). The interaction between HTRA2 and NDUFA13 is enhanced by interferon-beta
  and retinoic acid (Ma et al. 2007). Molecular modeling indicates that a HTRA2 trimer
  binds amino acid residues 102-144 of NDUFA13 (Kummari et al. 2021).
