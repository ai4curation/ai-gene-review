stable_id: R-HSA-388830
display_name: PI3K binds ICOS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ICOS ligation in T cells triggers the recruitment of PI3K, leading to increased
  production of PIP3 and stronger AKT phosphorylation compared to CD28 signaling.
  This enhanced activation is driven by a unique signaling motif in the cytoplasmic
  tail of ICOS, which enables more effective binding to PI3K components. As a result,
  ICOS signaling supports robust downstream signaling pathways that are crucial for
  T cell activation and differentiation, including the promotion of the T follicular
  helper (Tfh) cell phenotype (Fos et al. 2008).
