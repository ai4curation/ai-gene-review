species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'SHC1 (Src homology 2 domain-containing transforming protein) is known to
  bind two phosphorylated tyrosine docking sites of EGFR: Y1148 and Y1173 (corresponding
  to Y1172 and Y1197 when counting from the first amino acid of EGFR precursor, before
  the cleavage of the 24-amino acid signal peptide at the N-terminus takes place).
  Phosphorylation of Y1173 tyrosine residue was directly demonstrated in EGFRvIII
  mutant (Han et al. 2006, Grandal et al. 2007) as well as the phosphorylation of
  Y1148 (Huang et al. 2007). <br>Binding of SHC1 to EGFRvIII cancer mutant has not
  been tested but SHC1 is assumed to bind EGFRvIII in the same way it binds wild-type
  EGFR.'
