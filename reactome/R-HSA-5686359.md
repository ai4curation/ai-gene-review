summary: Surfactant catabolism by alveolar macrophages plays a small but critical
  part in surfactant recycling and metabolism. Upon ligand binding, granulocyte-macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSF), a heterodimer of alpha (CSF2RA) and
  beta (CSF2RB) subunits (Hansen et al. 2008), initiates a signalling process that
  not only induces proliferation, differentiation and functional activation of hematopoietic
  cells but can also determine surfactant uptake into alveolar macrophages and its
  degradation via clathrin-coated vesicles. The exact mechanism of surfactant degradation
  in macrophages is poorly understood (Jain et al. 2005, Ikegami 2006). GM-CSF-deficiency
  can result in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), a lung disease characterised
  by surfactant accumulation and lipid-engorged alveolar macrophages (Carey & Trapnell
  2010).
