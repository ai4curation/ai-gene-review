display_name: SCF-beta-TRCP binds p-7S-p100 in active NIK:p-S176,180-IKKA dimer:p-7S-p100:RELB
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylated C-terminal serines 866, 870 and 872 in NFKB2 creates binding
  site for beta-TRCP (beta-transducin repeat-containing protein), the receptor subunit
  of a SCF-type of E3 ubiquitin ligase, SCF beta-TRCP (Liang et al. 2006). The SKP1-CUL1-F-box
  (SCF) ubiquitin E3 ligase superfamily is the largest family of cullin-RING ligases,
  with interchangeable F-box proteins orchestrating the trafficking proteins for ubiquitination
  and degradation (Weathington & Mallampalli 2013). Beta-TRCP is an F-box protein
  that contains two domains, an F-box motif that binds SKP1 and allows assembly into
  SKP1-CUL1 complexes and a second protein-protein interaction domain that interacts
  with phosphorylated serines in NFKB2 (Bai et al. 1996, Skowyra et al. 1997, Patton
  et al. 1998).
