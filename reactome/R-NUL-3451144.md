display_name: KAT5 HAT complex acetylates TCF4 (ITF-2) gene at histone H4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ChIP studies in HEK293 cells show that RUVBL1(TIP49), TRRAP, TCF7L2(TCF4)
  and the histone acetyltransferase KAT5 (TIP60) are present at the TCF4/ITF-2 gene
  in vivo.  In rat epithelial cells, acetylation of histone H4 at the TCF4 (ITF-2)
  promoter is significantly reduced upon expression of a dominant negative version
  of RUVBL1 (TIP49), consistent with a role of a TIP49-containing HAT complex in activating
  WNT-dependent gene expression (Feng et al, 2003; Kolligs et al, 2002).
