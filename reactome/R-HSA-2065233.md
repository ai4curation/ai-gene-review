summary: Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is hydrolysed from its chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
  (CSPG) by an unknown human beta-xylosidase. The reaction shown here is based on
  studies of a rabbit lysosomal enzyme fraction assay (Takagaki et al. 1988). CSPG
  can have many CS chains attached to it; this example shows the hydrolysis of one
  CS chain from CSPG.

## Summary

Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is hydrolysed from its chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) by an unknown human beta-xylosidase. The reaction shown here is based on studies of a rabbit lysosomal enzyme fraction assay (Takagaki et al. 1988). CSPG can have many CS chains attached to it; this example shows the hydrolysis of one CS chain from CSPG.
