stable_id: R-HSA-379415
display_name: SLC7A7:SLC3A2 exchanges L-Arg for L-Leu, Na+ across the plasma membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SLC7A7 as a heterodimer with SLC3A2 in the plasma membrane mediates the exchange
  of arginine (L-Arg) for leucine (L-Leu) and a sodium ion (Na+). The physiological
  concentrations of arginine and leucine are expected to favor arginine export. By
  the criterion of Northern blotting, SLC7A6 is predominantly expressed in the kidney
  (Pfeiffer et al. 2000).
