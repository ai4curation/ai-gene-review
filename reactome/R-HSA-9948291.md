display_name: RQT complex binds K63polyUb-80S ribosome:no-go mRNA:peptidyl-tRNA with
  nascent peptide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ASCC2 subunit (Narita et al. 2022) of the Activating Signal Co-integrator
  1 complex (ASCC or ASC-1 complex, ASCC2:ASCC3:TRIP4, homolog of the ribosome quality
  control trigger complex RQT complex in yeast) binds K63-linked polyubiquitin conjugated
  to the RPS20 subunit of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Hashimoto et al. 2020, Juszkiewicz
  et al. 2020, Narita et al. 2022, and inferred from yeast homologs in Matsuo et al.
  2023). RPS10 ubiquitination is required for activity of the ASC-1 complex (Juszkiewicz
  and Hegde 2017, Matsuo et al. 2020). In yeast, RQT4 (homolog of TRIP4) also binds
  K63-linked polyubiquitin (Matsuo et al. 2023).

## Summary

The ASCC2 subunit (Narita et al. 2022) of the Activating Signal Co-integrator 1 complex (ASCC or ASC-1 complex, ASCC2:ASCC3:TRIP4, homolog of the ribosome quality control trigger complex RQT complex in yeast) binds K63-linked polyubiquitin conjugated to the RPS20 subunit of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Hashimoto et al. 2020, Juszkiewicz et al. 2020, Narita et al. 2022, and inferred from yeast homologs in Matsuo et al. 2023). RPS10 ubiquitination is required for activity of the ASC-1 complex (Juszkiewicz and Hegde 2017, Matsuo et al. 2020). In yeast, RQT4 (homolog of TRIP4) also binds K63-linked polyubiquitin (Matsuo et al. 2023).
