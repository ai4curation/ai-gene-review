species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha/beta
  (STAT1), Phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2)
  , Phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) , Phosphorylated
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) and Phosphorylated Signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) are believed to dissociate from
  the receptor complex (Dumoutier et al. 2004, Novak et al. 2008).  This is a black-box
  event because dissociation is inferred from other interleukin signaling cascades
  such as Interleukin-10 (Niemand et al. 2003, Braum et al. 2013, Xiong et al. 2014,
  Sheikh et al. 2006) where dissociation occurs before STAT dimerization and translocation
  to the nucleus.
