summary: <p>Exposure of various human cell lines to ultraviolet (UV) light leads to
  rapid decline in CDC25A but not CDC25B or CDC25C protein levels in a 26S proteasome-dependent
  manner, with no change in CDC25A mRNA level and preceded by the appearance of polyubiquitinated
  CDC25A (PolyUb-CDC25A) (Mailand et al. 2000). CDC25A protein and its phosphatase
  activity decline within 30 minutes of UV exposure (Mailand et al. 2000). CDC25A
  is required for removal of inhibitory phosphorylation p-Y15 from CDK2 during G1/S
  transition and the degradation of CDC25A leads to persistent inhibitory phosphorylation
  of CDK2 (Mailand et al. 2000).</p><p>As many nuclear proteins are degraded by the
