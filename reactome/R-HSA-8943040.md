species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'In response to a stalled replication fork, HLTF polyubiquitinates lysine-164
  of PCNA that has already been monoubiquitinated on lysine-164 by RAD18:UBE2B (RAD18:RAD6)
  (Unk et al. 2008, Motegi et al. 2008, MacKay et al. 2009, Achar et al. 2015). The
  ubiquitin donor is the E2 complex UBE2N:UBE2V2 (UBC13:MMS2) containing ubiquitin
  conjugated to UBE2N. The resulting polyubiquitin chain contains lysine-63 (K63)
  linkages and appears to change the repair process from translesion synthesis (TLS)
  to template switching (TS). HLTF interacts directly with PCNA, RAD18:UBE2B, and
  UBE2N:UBE2V2. HLTF and SHPRH are not completely redundant: HLTF is involved in repair
  of DNA lesions created by ultraviolet light while SHPRH is involved in repair of
  lesions created by methylmethane sulfonate (Lin et al. 2011). Despite the polyubiquitination
  activity of HLTF, in vivo HLTF appears to increase monoubiquitination of PCNA (Lin
  et al. 2011).'

## Summary

In response to a stalled replication fork, HLTF polyubiquitinates lysine-164 of PCNA that has already been monoubiquitinated on lysine-164 by RAD18:UBE2B (RAD18:RAD6) (Unk et al. 2008, Motegi et al. 2008, MacKay et al. 2009, Achar et al. 2015). The ubiquitin donor is the E2 complex UBE2N:UBE2V2 (UBC13:MMS2) containing ubiquitin conjugated to UBE2N. The resulting polyubiquitin chain contains lysine-63 (K63) linkages and appears to change the repair process from translesion synthesis (TLS) to template switching (TS). HLTF interacts directly with PCNA, RAD18:UBE2B, and UBE2N:UBE2V2. HLTF and SHPRH are not completely redundant: HLTF is involved in repair of DNA lesions created by ultraviolet light while SHPRH is involved in repair of lesions created by methylmethane sulfonate (Lin et al. 2011). Despite the polyubiquitination activity of HLTF, in vivo HLTF appears to increase monoubiquitination of PCNA (Lin et al. 2011).
