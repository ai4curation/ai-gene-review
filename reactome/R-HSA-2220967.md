stable_id: R-HSA-2220967
display_name: p-NICD1 PEST domain mutants do not bind FBXW7
species: Homo sapiens
summary: As binding of WD40 repeats of FBXW7 requires conserved phosphodegron in the
  PEST domain of NICD1, especially phosphorylation of threonine residue T2511 and
  serine residue S2513, FBXW7 cannot bind NICD1 PEST domain mutants which lack the
  conserved phosphodegron due to truncation of the PEST domain, or are not phosphorylated
  on conserved threonine and serine residues due to point mutations. Inability to
  bind FBXW7 and undergo FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination and degradation prolongs the
  half-life of NICD1 PEST domain mutants and results in persistent NOTCH1 signaling
  (O'Neil et al. 2007, Thompson et al. 2007).
