display_name: MLKL binds HSP90:CDC37
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), is the terminal
  known obligatory effector in the necroptosis pathway, and is activated following
  phosphorylation by receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3). Activated MLKL
  translocates to membranes, leading to membrane destabilisation and subsequent cell
  death. Heat‑shock protein 90 (HSP90) and cell division cycle 37 (CDC37) cochaperone
  complex contributes to activation of MLKL (Jacobsen AV et al. 2016; Zhao XM et al.
  2016; Bigenzahn JW et al. 2016). It remains unclear whether HSP90 influences MLKL
  folding, oligomerization, or membrane translocation, though it is plausible that
  HSP90 affects all of these activation steps (Murphy JM 2020).
