summary: Damaged mitochondria are flagged by ubiquitin (Ub) chains that are conjugated
  to proteins at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). This process is regulated
  by the PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of Parkin (PRKN), an E3 ubiquitin protein
  ligase that, when activated, ubiquitinates a broad range of MOM proteins (Gladkova
  C et al., 2018; Sauve V et al., 2022). The conjugated Ub chains are recognized by
  cargo receptors such as sequestosome 1 (p62 or SQSTM1), nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52)
  and optineurin (OPTN, also called FIP2 and NRP), which tether damaged mitochondria
  to components of the autophagy machinery promoting selective autophagy of mitochondria
  (mitophagy) (Onishi M et al., 2021; Goodall EA et al., 2022; Adriaenssens E et al.,
  2022). <p>OPTN is an Ub-binding adaptor protein, which is recruited to damaged mitochondria
  in a PINK1:PRKN-dependent manner (Wong YC & Holzbaur EL 2014; Heo JM et al., 2015;
  Lazarou M et al., 2015; reviewed in Qiu Y et al., 2022). Structural and biochemical
  studies demonstrate that OPTN binds polyUb chains via its C-terminal Ub binding
  domain (UBD) with a preference for M1- and K63-linked polyUb chains (Gleason CE
  et al., 2011; Nakazawa S et al., 2016; Li F et al., 2018). A surface plasmon resonance
  (SPR) and ITC binding assays show that OPTN and M1-linked polyUb form a complex
  with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) value in the micromolar range (Nakazawa
  S et al., 2016; Li F et al., 2018). <p>OPTN interacts with TANK-binding kinase 1

## Summary
