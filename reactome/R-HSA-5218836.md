display_name: PTK2beta binds alphaVbeta3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Proline tyrosine kinase 2-beta (PTK2B), also known as cell adhesion kinase-beta
  or related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase, is a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase
  closely related to focal adhesion kinase (FAK1) that couples receptors, including
  integrins, with a variety of downstream effectors such as small G proteins belonging
  to the Ras and Rho families, mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase C,
  and inositol phosphate metabolism (Avraham et al. 2000). PYK2B has been shown to
  play a critical role in the adhesion and migration of many cell types. PYK2B has
  been shown to localise to integrin and has been demonstrated to associate directly
  with integrin beta3 cytoplasmic tail (Butler & Blystone 2005, Duong & Rodan 2000,
  Le Boeuf et al. 2006).
