display_name: BRCA1-A complex deubiquitinates K63polyUb-histone H2A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'BRCC3 (BRCC36) as part of the BRCA1-A complex, antagonizes RNF8-Ubc13-dependent
  ubiquitination events at DNA double strand breaks (Shao et al. 2009), specifically
  removing Lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin on histone H2A and H2AX. K63-linked polyubiquitination
  of H2A is induced by DNA damage and is required for the DNA repair response (Cao
  & Yan, 2012). '

## Summary

BRCC3 (BRCC36) as part of the BRCA1-A complex, antagonizes RNF8-Ubc13-dependent ubiquitination events at DNA double strand breaks (Shao et al. 2009), specifically removing Lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin on histone H2A and H2AX. K63-linked polyubiquitination of H2A is induced by DNA damage and is required for the DNA repair response (Cao & Yan, 2012).
