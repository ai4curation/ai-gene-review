stable_id: R-HSA-380782
display_name: STAT binds to the active receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Among the seven members of the STAT family, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5 alpha and
  -beta, and STAT6 have been shown to bind to the activated PDGF beta-receptor (PDGFRB)
  and to be phosphorylated after PDGF stimulation; binding also occurs to the alpha-receptor
  (PDGFRA), albeit only weakly.
