display_name: VxPx-containing ciliary membrane proteins are delivered to the ciliary
  membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Exocyst-mediated fusion of the Golgi-derived vesicle delivers the VxPx-containing
  membrane proteins to the ciliary membrane, although the precise mechanisms remain
  to be worked out (Mazelova et al, 2009; Wang et al, 2012; reviewed in Sung and Leroux,
  2013). Vesicles carrying membrane proteins destined for the cilium may fuse at the
  periciliary membrane at the base of the cilium and deliver cargo to the IFT system.
  Ciliary membrane proteins may also diffuse laterally into the periciliary membrane
  after fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane (reviewed in Hsiao et al, 2012;
  Sung and Leroux, 2013). Although not depicted in this reaction, there is evidence
  that some of the protein-protein interactions of the ciliary-targeting complex may
  persist into the periciliary or ciliary membrane region (Wang et al, 2012).
