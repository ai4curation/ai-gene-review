display_name: PP2A dephosphorylates serine-127 of YAP1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interaction between integrin alpha5 (ITGA5) and fibronectin acts through
  an uncharacterized mechanism to cause protein phosphatase PP2A to dephosphorylate
  serine-127 of YAP1 (Yun et al. 2019, Jiang et al. 2021). Phosphoserine-127 causes
  YAP1 to be retained in the cytosol and its dephosphorylation allows YAP1 to transit
  to the nucleus.
