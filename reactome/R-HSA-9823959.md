stable_id: R-HSA-9823959
display_name: SMAD2,3 and GATA6-AS1 lncRNA bind the GATA6 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NODAL signaling in the anterior primitive streak causes phosphorylation of
  SMAD2 and SMAD3 which co-translocate with SMAD4 to the nucleus and together bind
  the promoter of the GATA6 gene (inferred from human pluripotent stem cells in Brown
  et al. 2011, Yang et al. 2020). The antisense transcript GATA6-AS1 from an upstream
  region of the GATA6 coding region enhances the interaction between SMAD2,3 and the
  GATA6 promoter (Yang et al. 2020). GATA6-AS1 is required for differentiation of
  definitive endoderm from embryonic stem cells (Yang et al. 2020).
