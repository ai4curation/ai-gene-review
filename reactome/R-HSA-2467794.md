display_name: Resolution of sister chromatids
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cohesin complexes dissociate from chromosomal arms in prometaphase, leading
  to sister chromatid resolution. Sister chromatid resolution involves separation
  of sister chromosomal arms while cohesion at sister centromeres persists (Losada
  et al. 1998, Hauf et al. 2001, Hauf et al. 2005). Cohesin and CDCA5 (Sororin) simultaneously
  dissociate from chromosomal arms in prometaphase (Nishiyama et al. 2010, Zhang et
  al. 2011). This process, triggered by CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of CDCA5 (Dreier
  et al. 2011, Zhang et al. 2011) and PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of the STAG2 cohesin
  subunit (Hauf et al. 2005), is controlled by WAPAL (Gandhi et al. 2006, Kueng et
  al. 2006, Shintomi and Hirano 2009). WAPAL controls cohesion of sister chromatids
  likely through competing with CDCA5 for binding to cohesin-associated PDS5 (PDS5A
  and PDS5B) (Nishiyama et al. 2010). While the interaction of WAPAL with PDS5 depends
  on CDCA5 (Nishiyama et al. 2010), WAPAL maintains its association with cohesin through
  interaction with cohesin subunits (Kueng et al. 2006, Shintomi and Hirano 2009).
