display_name: STAT3 phosphorylation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) acts downstream
  of various cellular receptors and is primarily involved in gene transcription. STAT3
  is activated by serine/threonine kinases (Rebe et al. 2013). The IL-37:IL-18R1:SIGIRR
  complex can facilitate the phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 (Nold Petry et
  al. 2015). However, the precise mechanism is unclear. Hence, this event is represented
  as a black box.
