display_name: Phospho-AKT1 phosphorylates NOS3 (eNOS) on serine-1177
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylated AKT1 phosphorylates serine-1117 of NOS3 (eNOS) (Dimmeler et
  al. 1999, Jin et al. 2021, inferred from bovine homologs in Fulton et al. 1999)
  in response to laminar shear stress (Jin et al. 2021). Knockdown of AKT1 reduced
  phosphorylation of serine-1117 but not serine-1179 of NOS3, as serine-1179 is phosphorylated
  by PKN2 (Jin et al. 2021).
