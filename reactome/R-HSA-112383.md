display_name: Hypophosphorylation of RNA Pol II CTD by FCP1P protein
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FCP1 dephosphorylates RNAP II in ternary elongation complexes as well as
  in solution and is thought to function in the recycling of RNAP II during the transcription
  cycle. Biochemical experiments suggest that human FCP1 targets CTDs that are phosphorylated
  at serine 2 (CTD-serine 2) and/or CTD-serine 5. It is also observed to stimulate
  elongation independent of its catalytic activity. Dephosphorylation of Ser2 - phosphorylated
  Pol II results in hypophosphorylated form that disengages capping enzymes (CE).
