stable_id: R-HSA-6786114
display_name: IL13:IL13RA:TYK2 binds IL4R:JAK2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukin-13 receptor alpha subunit (IL13RA1) binds Interleukin-13 (IL13)
  with a relatively low affinity, but when paired with Interleukin-4 receptor subunit
  alpha (IL4R), binds with much higher affinity (Kd = 400 pmol/L) and forms a functional
  IL13 receptor that is capable of signaling (Miloux et al. 1997). This type II IL13
  receptor complex is also the alternative type II receptor for IL4.
