species: Homo sapiens
summary: In response to IFNG (interferon-gamma) treatment, JAK1 mediates phosphorylation
  of RAF1 on an unknown tyrosine residue. As there is direct binding between JAK1
  and RAF1, and as JAK1 tyrosine kinase activity is necessary, it is plausible that
  JAK1 is the tyrosine kinase that acts on RAF1, but indirect JAK1-mediated phosphorylation
  of RAF1 has not been excluded (Sakatsume et al. 1998).

## Summary

In response to IFNG (interferon-gamma) treatment, JAK1 mediates phosphorylation of RAF1 on an unknown tyrosine residue. As there is direct binding between JAK1 and RAF1, and as JAK1 tyrosine kinase activity is necessary, it is plausible that JAK1 is the tyrosine kinase that acts on RAF1, but indirect JAK1-mediated phosphorylation of RAF1 has not been excluded (Sakatsume et al. 1998).
