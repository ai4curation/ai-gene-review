summary: KEAP1 is a substrate for SQSTM1-mediated autophagy (Zhang et al, 2005; Jain
  et al, 2010; Fan et al, 2010; Taguchi et al, 2012). Although this has not been described
  in molecular detail, SQSTM1-dependent targeting of KEAP1 to the autophagosome presumably
  involves dissociation of KEAP1 and SQSTM1 from RBX1 and CUL3.

## Summary

KEAP1 is a substrate for SQSTM1-mediated autophagy (Zhang et al, 2005; Jain et al, 2010; Fan et al, 2010; Taguchi et al, 2012). Although this has not been described in molecular detail, SQSTM1-dependent targeting of KEAP1 to the autophagosome presumably involves dissociation of KEAP1 and SQSTM1 from RBX1 and CUL3.
