display_name: Fusion of viral membrane with host cell membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: With the transition of gp41 into the six-helix bundle, fusion of the viral
  and target cell membranes begins to take place.  The specifics of fusion are not
  completely clear, but it is understood that fusion proceeds after insertion of the
  gp41 fusion peptide, which results in curvature of viral and target cell membranes.  This
  results in a state of hemi-fusion, where only the outer lipid bilayers of each membrane
  are fused, whereas membrane leaflets that are distal with respect to the intermembrane
  gap remain separate at this stage.  Hemi-fusion allows the exchange of lipids between
  the contacting leaflets, whereas the exchange of aqueous content between the virus
  and the cell remains blocked.  The next step in fusion is the merger of the distal
  leaflets, leading to the formation of a nascent fusion pore, which leads to mixing
  of viral and cellular contents.  Studies of fusion of Influenza virus suggested
  that multiple hairpin structures may form a narrow fusion pore which subsequently
  expands to a larger opening.  In the case of HIV, this larger opening allows for
  passage of the Matrix-surrounded viral core out of the virus and into the host cell
  cytoplasm.
