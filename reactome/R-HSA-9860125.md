stable_id: R-HSA-9860125
display_name: Binding of ATRA to TGFBR3 gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Retinoic acid enhances the expression of TGFBR3 (betaglycan) by regulating
  its transcription. TGFBR3 promoter has binding sites for RA receptor and same has
  been confirmed through luciferase assay  conducted on  C2C12 cells, a differentiating
  myoblast cellline (Lopez-Casillas et al, 2003).  TGFBR3 expression is also found
  to increase in a dose dependent way in human nueroblastoma cells in response to
  retinoic acid (Cohen et ai, 1995).
