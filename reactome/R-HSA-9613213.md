stable_id: R-HSA-9613213
display_name: NAB2 and CHD4 bind and repress EGR-mediated RRAD gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NAB2 is recruited to EGR2 to the RRAD promoter through interaction with the
  NCD1 (NAB conserved domain 1) (Svaren et al, 1996; Svaren et al, 1998).  NAB2 in
  turn recruits the CHD4 subunit of the NURD chromatin remodelling complex through
  its CID (CHD4-interacting domain) and in this manner, represses transcription from
  the RRAD promoter (Srinivasan et al, 2006; Mager et al, 2008). In addition to roles
  in cellular proliferation and cardiac function, RRAD protein is known to contribute
  to RHO signaling, which promotes Schwann cell migration and myelination (Zhu et
  al, 1999; Wang et al, 2010; Chang et al, 2007, Ward et al, 2002; Yamauchi et al,
  2004; Melendez-Vasquez et al, 2004).
