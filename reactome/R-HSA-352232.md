stable_id: R-HSA-352232
display_name: SLC7A5:SLC3A2 transports neutral amino acids from extracellular region
  to cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SLC7A5, complexed with SLC3A2 in the plasma membrane, mediates the uptake
  of neutral amino acids. The process is Na+-independent and not coupled to H+ transport.
  As measured by Northern blotting SLC7A5 is widely expressed in the body. In situ
  hybridization studies indicate that the gene product is widely expressed in the
  body but not in the kidney (Pineda et al. 1999; Prasad et al. 1999, Vumma et al.
  2008).
