display_name: Tankyrase binds AXIN
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Several recent chemical screens have identified inhibitors of the poly-ADP
  ribosylation enzymes tankyrase (TNKS) 1 and 2 as regulators of WNT signalling (Huang
  et al, 2009; Chen et al, 2009; Waaler et al, 2012).  Endogenous TNKS1 and 2 associate
  with AXIN2 in SW480 cells as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. Both AXIN1 and
  AXIN2 interact strongly with TNKS1/2 by two-hybrid, and deletion analysis shows
  that amino acids 19-30 of AXIN1 are necessary and sufficient for binding to TNKS1.  This
  region, termed the tankyrase-binding-domain (TBD) is necessary and sufficient for
  the interaction in GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation studies (Huang et al,
  2009).
