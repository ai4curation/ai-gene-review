display_name: Interaction and oligomerization of MALT1 to Bcl10
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Oligomerized Bcl10 facilitates the association with MALT1 to form the CBM
  signalosome. MALT1 possesses one death domain (DD) and 2 immunoglobulin-like domains
  (Ig-like) in its N-terminal region and a caspase like domain (CLD) in its C-terminal
  region. The region between amino acids 107 and 119 of Bcl10 bind to the two Ig-like
  domains of MALT1. After binding to CARMA1 and Bcl10 complex, MALT1 also undergoes
  oligomerization. Only the oligomerized forms of Bcl10 and MALT1 are capable of activating
  IKK. '

## Summary

Oligomerized Bcl10 facilitates the association with MALT1 to form the CBM signalosome. MALT1 possesses one death domain (DD) and 2 immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig-like) in its N-terminal region and a caspase like domain (CLD) in its C-terminal region. The region between amino acids 107 and 119 of Bcl10 bind to the two Ig-like domains of MALT1. After binding to CARMA1 and Bcl10 complex, MALT1 also undergoes oligomerization. Only the oligomerized forms of Bcl10 and MALT1 are capable of activating IKK.
