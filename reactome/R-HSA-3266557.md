display_name: Factor I cleaves iC3b
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Factor I (CFI) cleaves iC3b into two molecules, C3c, which is released into
  solution, and C3dg, which remains attached to the membrane. This cleavage requires
  Complement receptor type 1 (CR1), which serves a cofactor for CFI (Medof et al.
  1982).


  iC3b and C3dg can bind CR2 (CD21) to enhance B-cell immunity (Tuveson et al.1991,
  Sarrias et al. 2001).'

## Summary

Factor I (CFI) cleaves iC3b into two molecules, C3c, which is released into solution, and C3dg, which remains attached to the membrane. This cleavage requires Complement receptor type 1 (CR1), which serves a cofactor for CFI (Medof et al. 1982).

iC3b and C3dg can bind CR2 (CD21) to enhance B-cell immunity (Tuveson et al.1991, Sarrias et al. 2001).
