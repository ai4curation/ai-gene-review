summary: "Monocytes express the Interleukin-27 receptor and in response to Interleukin-27\
  \ induce Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (STAT1) and\

## Summary

Monocytes express the Interleukin-27 receptor and in response to Interleukin-27 induce Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (STAT1) and STAT3 phosphorylation (Pflanz et al. 2004). 
Interleukin-27 can induce formation of STAT1/STAT3 heterodimers (Guzzo et al. 2010, Hirahara et al. 2015). Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B (NFkB) is activated by Interleukin-27 stimulation in response to STAT1/STAT3 activation and is essential for Interleukin-27 to activate the production of cytokines (Guzzo et al. 2010).
