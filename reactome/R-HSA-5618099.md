## Summary

Steroid hormones receptors (SHRs) are intracellular transcription factors that can be activated by binding specific ligands (i.e., steroid hormones (SH)) to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Ray DW et AL. 1999; Pike AC et al. 1999; Bledsoe RK et al. 2002; Li Y et al. 2005; Kumar R and McEwan IJ 2012; Kumar R et al. 2011; Williams SP & Sigler PB 1998; Tanenbaum DM et al. 1998; Lusher SJ et al. 2012). LBD (E-region) resides in the C-terminal half of the receptor and in addition to ligand binding function contains a transcriptional activation function (AF2), sequences for dimerization, heat shock protein association, intermolecular silencing and intramolecular repression (Kumar R and McEwan IJ 2012).
