display_name: NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) complex binds RAC1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Direct interaction between recombinant GTP-bound human RAC1 and human NCF2
  (p67phox), a component of the NOX2 complex, leads to the activation of the NOX2
  complex (Price et al. 2002). NADPH oxidase (NOX) proteins are membrane-associated,
  multiunit enzymes that catalyze the reduction of oxygen using NADPH as an electron
  donor. NOX proteins produce superoxide (O2.-) via a single electron reduction (Brown
  & Griendling 2009). Superoxide molecules function as second messengers to stimulate
  diverse redox signaling pathways linked to various functions including angiogenesis.
  VEGF specifically stimulates superoxide production via RAC1 dependent activation
  of NOX2 complex. VEGF rapidly activates RAC1 and promotes translocation of RAC1
  from cytosol to the membrane. At the membrane RAC1 interacts with the NOX enzyme
  complex via a direct interaction with NOX2 (gp91phox or CYBB) followed by subsequent
  interaction with the NCF2 (Neutrophil cytosol factor 2) or p67phox subunit and this
  makes the complex active (reviewed in Bedard & Krause 2007). O2.- derived from Rac1-dependent
  NOX2 are involved in oxidation and inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases
  (PTPs) which negatively regulate VEGFR2, thereby enhancing VEGFR2 autophosphorylation,
  and subsequent redox signaling linked to angiogenic responses such as endothelial
  cell proliferation and migration (reviewed in Ushio-Fukai 2006, 2007).
