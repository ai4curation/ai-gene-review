summary: Cholesterol is synthesized de novo from acetyl CoA, which is transformed
  in an initial sequence of 15 reactions into lanosterol. The synthesis of cholesterol
  from lanosterol is classically said to follow either of two major routes, one in
  which reduction of the double bond at position 24 in the isooctyl side chain is
  the final step (cholesterol synthesis via desmosterol, the Bloch pathway (Bloch
  1965) and one in which this reduction is the first step (cholesterol biosynthesis
  via lathosterol, the Kandutsch-Russell (KR) pathway (Kandutsch & Russell 1960).<p>More
  recent tracer studies in intact mice and human and mouse cell lines support a revised
  view of the physiological roles of these two pathways (Mitsche et al. 2015). These
  studies indicate that the Bloch pathway is the predominant one in most tissues,
  notably testes and adrenal gland, and is constitutive. Little flux through the complete
  KR pathway was found in any tissue. Instead, Mitsche et al. observed a modified
  form of the pathway, in which delta(24)-sterol reductase (DHCR24) reduced zymosterol,
  a Bloch pathway intermediate, to zymostenol, a KR intermediate, which was then metabolized
  via the last three steps of the KR pathway to form cholesterol. Usage of this pathway
  was observed in skin, preputial glands and brain. Here, these reactions are grouped
  into two pathways. “Zymostenol biosynthesis via lathosterol” contains the initial
  nine steps of the KR pathway that now appear to play a minor role in cholesterol
  biosynthesis. “Cholesterol biosynthesis from zymosterol (modified KR pathway)” contains
  the reaction that generates ZYMSTNL and the three KR reactions that convert it to
  cholesterol (Mietsche et al. 2015).<p>The 7-dehydrocholesterol produced by the modified
