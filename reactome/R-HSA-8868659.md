display_name: Clathrin recruits auxilins to the clathrin-coated vesicle
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After fission from the plasma membrane, auxilin proteins DNAJC6 and GAK are
  recruited to the vesicle through interaction with clathrin and phosphoinositides,
  in particular PI4P (Greener et al, 2000; Lee et al, 2006; Massol et al, 2006; Taylor
  et al, 2011; Scheele et al, 2001; Fotin et al, 2004a; Fotin et al, 2004b; Guan et
  al, 2010; reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Sousa and Lafer, 2015).  Auxilin
  in turn recruits the ATPase HSPA8 (also known as HSC70) , which uses the energy
  from ATP hydrolysis to remove the clathrin-coat from the vesicle, priming it for
  fusion with a subsequent endosomal compartment (Schlossman et al, 1984; Ungewickell
  et al, 1995; Rappoport et al, 2008; Xing et al, 2010; Bocking et al, 2011; Rothnie
