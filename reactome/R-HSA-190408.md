stable_id: R-HSA-190408
display_name: Autocatalytic phosphorylation of FGFR2b
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity of the activated FGFR2b receptor
  leads to multiple phosphorylation events, creating a number of binding sites on
  its cytoplasmic tail for membrane bound docking proteins to gather intracellular
  signaling mediators.  Two isoforms of FGFR2b generated by alternative splicing and
  differing only by the presence ("long") or absence ("short") of two amino acid residues
  at positions 428-429 are equally active in ligand binding and dimerization but differ
  in their abilities to interact with downstream targets.  Based on sequence alignment,
  FGFR2 contains all 8 of the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues identified in FGFR1. '
