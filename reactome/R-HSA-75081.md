stable_id: R-HSA-75081
display_name: Formation of AT-AC B Complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The U4atac/U6atac enters the spliceosome and U6atac snRNA forms base pairing
  interactions with the 5' ss and also forms base pairing interactions with U12 and
  U4atac is partially displaced. U5 snRNP, the only snRNP common to both the major
  and minor splicing pathways, also joins the spliceosome to form the B complex and
  interacts with nucleotides within the 3' end of the exon flanking the 5' ss (Singh
  et al.2016, Wu and Krainer 1999).
