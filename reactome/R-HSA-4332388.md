display_name: Activation of MAP3K7 in response to WNT
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Endogenous MAP3K7 is phosphorylated in a CAMK2-dependent fashion upon co-expression
  of WNT5A or after stimulation of calcium signaling (Ishitani et al, 2003a).  Despite
  evidence that co-precipitated MAP3K7 is phosphorylated in vitro in the presence
  of CAMK2, direct phosphorylation of MAP3K7 by CAMK2 using purified proteins has
  not been demonstrated (Ishitani et al, 2003a).  The roles of polyubiquitination
  and accessory proteins TAB1, 2 or 3 in MAP3K7 activation have not been investigated
  in the context of non-canonical WNT signaling and are therefore omitted from this
  reaction (reviewed in Dai et al, 2012).
