display_name: p-5Y-GAB in the RET-GRB2-GAB complexes binds p85-PI3K
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Following recruitment and phosphorylation of GAB1 or GAB2 to the RET complex,
  it binds the p85 subunit of p85-containing PI3 kinase (p85-PI3K), resulting in its
  activation (Murakami et al. 1999, Hayashi et al. 2000, Besset et al. 2000). p85-PI3K
  consists of a p85 adaptor subunit, which contains one Src homology 3 (SH3) and two
  Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, and a p110 subunit that has catalytic activity (Kapeller
  & Cantley 1994). These subunits are tightly associated (Carpenter et al. 1990).
  Though p85-PI3K can be phosphorylated, it is binding of the p85 SH2 domains that
  activates the enzyme (Rordorf-Nikolic et al. 1995). <br><br>GAB2 has three tyrosine
  residues, Y452, Y476 and Y584, which are involved in p85-PI3K binding (Crouin et
  al. 2001, Maus et al. 2009). GAB1 also becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and directly
  associates with p85 when transducing signals from receptor tyrosine kinases to p85
  (Holgado-Madruga et al. 1997, Mattoon et al. 2004). There are three potential binding
  sites for p85 on GAB1 (Y447, Y472, and Y589) (Holgado-Madruga et al. 1997). Phosphorylation
  at these sites in GAB1 is represented in this reaction as a likely prerequisite
  for p85 binding, but this is not experimentally confirmed, hence this reaction is
  displayed as an uncertain event.
