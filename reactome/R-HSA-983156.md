species: Homo sapiens
summary: Monoubiquitinated substrate acquires additional ubiquitin modifications in
  the form of multiple single attachments or a ubiquitin chain. Polyubiquitin chains
  added through K48 residue of ubiquitin typically targets the substrate for degradation
  (Raymond et al. 2009).

# Polyubiquitination of substrate
**Reactome ID:** [R-HSA-983156](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-983156)
**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

Monoubiquitinated substrate acquires additional ubiquitin modifications in the form of multiple single attachments or a ubiquitin chain. Polyubiquitin chains added through K48 residue of ubiquitin typically targets the substrate for degradation (Raymond et al. 2009).
