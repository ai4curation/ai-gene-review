display_name: gamma-secretase cleaves the p75NTR transmembrane domain
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Within early endosomes, p75NTR C-Terminal Fragment undergoes processing by
  gamma-secretase, a complex composed of a presenilin homodimer (PSEN1 or PSEN2),
  nicastrin (NCSTN), APH1 (APH1A or APH1B) and PEN2. Such a minimal complex is sufficient
  for secretase activity, although other components may exist. The p75NTR cleavage
  by gamma-secretase gives rise to a 20-kD ICD (IntraCellular Domain) fragment,  and
  to a small peptide, the significance of which is unknown but that is analogous to
  the A-beta peptides generated from amyloid precursor protein. p75NTR ICD may have
  cytoplasmic and nuclear signalling functions and it is unstable.
