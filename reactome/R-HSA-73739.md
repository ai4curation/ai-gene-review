display_name: Recruitment of Acetylated SL1 to phosUBF-1:rDNA Promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Human SL1 does not bind to DNA itself, rather it is recruited to the rDNA
  promoter through a physical interaction with UBF-1. Phosphorylation of UBF-1 within
  the carboxy-terminal region is required for SL1 binding. SL1 consists of TATA-binding
  protein (TBP) and three associated factors (TAFIs). SL1 has no sequence-specific
  DNA binding activity its recruitment to the promoter being mediated by specific
  interactions with UBF. Once bound the SL1 complex makes direct contact with the
  DNA promoter and guides promoter-specific initiation. <p>Studies to identify the
  mechanistic relationship between SL1 and UBF-1 have indicated that the interaction
  between UBF-1 and SL1 is regulated by tumor suppressor proteins such as Rb and P53,
  although it has also been proposed that Rb prevents UBF-1 from binding to DNA itself.
