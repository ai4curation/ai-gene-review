stable_id: R-HSA-4551649
display_name: RANBP2 SUMOylates RANBP2 with SUMO1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RANBP2 SUMOylates RANBP2 at lysine-2592, lysine-2650, and lysine-2723 with
  SUMO1 (Pichler et al. 2002, Pichler et al. 2004, Cooper et al. 2005). RANBP2 does
  not resemble HECT or RING type SUMO E3 ligases and instead uses hydrophobic interactions
  with UBE2I (UBC9) to catalyze SUMOylation.
