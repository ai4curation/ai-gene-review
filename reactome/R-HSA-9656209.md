summary: After phosphorylation of MAPKs by complexes containing RAF1 mutants, activated
  MAPK signaling complexes dissociate in a manner similar to wildtype, although this
  has not been explicitly demonstrated in all cases. Active complexes may signal from
  other cellular locations or may amplify signaling through rounds of heterodimerization
  with other inactive RAF monomers (reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011; Cseh et al,
  2014).

# Dissociation of RAS:RAF1 mutant complex

**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Summary

After phosphorylation of MAPKs by complexes containing RAF1 mutants, activated MAPK signaling complexes dissociate in a manner similar to wildtype, although this has not been explicitly demonstrated in all cases. Active complexes may signal from other cellular locations or may amplify signaling through rounds of heterodimerization with other inactive RAF monomers (reviewed in Matallanas et al, 2011; Cseh et al, 2014).
