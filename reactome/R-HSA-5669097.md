display_name: LTA trimer binds TNFRSF1A,1B,14
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA) is a cytokine produced by lymphocytes that plays
  an important role in the inflammatory and immunologic response. LTA is a product
  of stimulated T cells and can help elicit cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. In
  its homotrimeric form, LTA binds the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily
  members TNFRSF1A, 1B and 14 (Aggarwal 2003).
