species: Homo sapiens
summary: The steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein-related lipid transfer
  (START) domain proteins constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved and widely
  expressed proteins that have been implicated in lipid transport, metabolism, and
  signaling. Human PCTP-like protein (STARD10) (Olayioye et al. 2005) is thought to
  be a dual specificity lipid transfer protein capable of shuttling phosphatidylcholine
  (PC) (and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), not shown here) between intracellular membranes,
  especially to lamellar body membranes. Saturated PC is a major component of pulmonary
  surfactant, a mixture of proteins and phospholipids that plays an important role
  in facilitating gas exchange by maintaining alveolar stability. After synthesis
  in the endoplasmic reticulum, saturated PC is transported to lamellar bodies (LBs)
  for storage prior to secretion. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1)
  mediated reacylation is a final step in saturated PC synthesis prior to transport
  and LPCAT1 is proposed to form a complex with STARD10 at the ER membrane to facilitate
  the synthesis then transport of saturated PC to LBs (Lin et al. 2015).
