summary: 'Secretory cargo destined to be secreted or to arrive at the plasma membrane
  (PM) leaves the ER via distinct exit sites. This cargo is destined for the Golgi
  apparatus for further processing.


  About 25% of the proteome may be exported from the ER in human cells. This cargo
  is recognized and concentrated into COPII vesicles, which range in size from 60-90
  nm, and move cargo from the ER to the ERGIC. Soluble cargo in the ER lumen is concentrated
  into COPII vesicles through interaction with a receptor with the receptor subsequently
  recycled to the ER in COPI vesicles through retrograde traffic.


  The ERGIC (ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment, also known as vesicular-tubular
  clusters, VTCs) is a stable, biochemically distinct compartment located adjacent
  to ER exit sites.


  Retrograde traffic makes use of microtubule-directed COPI-coated vesicles, carrying
  ER proteins and membrane back to the ER.'

## Summary

Secretory cargo destined to be secreted or to arrive at the plasma membrane (PM) leaves the ER via distinct exit sites. This cargo is destined for the Golgi apparatus for further processing.

About 25% of the proteome may be exported from the ER in human cells. This cargo is recognized and concentrated into COPII vesicles, which range in size from 60-90 nm, and move cargo from the ER to the ERGIC. Soluble cargo in the ER lumen is concentrated into COPII vesicles through interaction with a receptor with the receptor subsequently recycled to the ER in COPI vesicles through retrograde traffic.

The ERGIC (ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment, also known as vesicular-tubular clusters, VTCs) is a stable, biochemically distinct compartment located adjacent to ER exit sites.

Retrograde traffic makes use of microtubule-directed COPI-coated vesicles, carrying ER proteins and membrane back to the ER.
