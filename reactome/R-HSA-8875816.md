display_name: STAT3 binds activated MET receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The STAT3 transcription factor may bind, directly and indirectly, to activated
  MET. Direct binding of STAT3 involves phosphorylated tyrosine residue Y1356 of MET.
  Indirect binding of STAT3 to activated MET involves GAB1, but this interaction has
  not been studied in detail (Schaper et al. 1997, Boccaccio et al. 1998).
