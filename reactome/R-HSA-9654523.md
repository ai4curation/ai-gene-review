display_name: ARL2:GTP bind PDE6D on KRAS4B
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ARL2:GTP binds to an allosteric site on PDE6D, promoting a conformational
  change in PDE6D that releases the prenyl group on KRAS4B (Ismail et al, 2011; Schmick
  et al, 2014; reviewed in Schmick et al, 2015). Although the details remain to be
  fully established, it is possible that after release from PDE6D, KRAS4B is recycled
  to the plasma membrane by virtue of interaction with the negatively charged membrane
  of recyling endosomes (Chen et al, 2010; Schmick et al, 2014; reviewed in Schmick
  et al, 2015).
