stable_id: R-HSA-5228523
display_name: RANBP2 SUMOylates MDM2 with SUMO1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RANBP2 of the nuclear pore complex SUMOylates MDM2 with SUMO1 at lysine-182
  (Mayauchi et al. 2002). An unSUMOylatable mutant of MDM2 accumulates in the cytosol
  so SUMOylation may be part of the process of nuclear import of MDM2 (Miyauchi et
  al. 2002).

## Summary

RANBP2 of the nuclear pore complex SUMOylates MDM2 with SUMO1 at lysine-182 (Mayauchi et al. 2002). An unSUMOylatable mutant of MDM2 accumulates in the cytosol so SUMOylation may be part of the process of nuclear import of MDM2 (Miyauchi et al. 2002).
