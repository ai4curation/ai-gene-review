species: Homo sapiens
summary: Dynamin is recruited to the growing vesicle and, under conditions that interfere
  with its GTPase activity, dynamin forms a collar or ring around the neck of the
  budding vesicle. It is unclear whether dynamin acts as a mechanochemical transducer
  to generate fission or as a recruiter to attach other proteins that are directly
  responsible for the fission step. Lipid-modifying enzymes such as endophilin are
  also involved in vesicle formation. Endophilin is an acyltransferase that interacts
  with dynamin and that generates lysophosphatidic acid. The current view is that
  this reaction produces a negative curvature at the neck of the vesicle.
