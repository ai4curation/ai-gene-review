species: Homo sapiens
summary: Misfolded proteins in the cytosol are targeted to degradation via ubiquitination.
  The E2 UBE2N/UBE2V1 and E3 ligase ubiquitination system recruits and transfers ubiquitin
  molecules to misfolded proteins. The E3 ligase Parkin tags the proteins with multiple
  K63-linked ubiquitin molecules (Olzmann JA et al. 2007).

## Summary

Misfolded proteins in the cytosol are targeted to degradation via ubiquitination. The E2 UBE2N/UBE2V1 and E3 ligase ubiquitination system recruits and transfers ubiquitin molecules to misfolded proteins. The E3 ligase Parkin tags the proteins with multiple K63-linked ubiquitin molecules (Olzmann JA et al. 2007).
