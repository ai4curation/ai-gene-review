stable_id: R-HSA-6790454
display_name: SUMOylation of XPC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: XPC undergoes SUMOylation following UV irradiation on several consensus SUMOylation
  sites (van Cuijk et al. 2015). SUMOylation of XPC probably succeeds the UV-DDB mediated
  ubiquitination of XPC, as the presence of both DDB2 and XPA is required for SUMOylation
  (Wang et al. 2005), but it has also been reported that SUMOylation of XPC was DDB2-independent
  (Akita et al. 2015). It is unclear whether XPC is modified by SUMO1 (Wang et al.
  2005, Akita et al. 2015) or poly-SUMO2/3 (Poulsen et al. 2013). SUMO conjugases
  PIAS1 and PIAS3 both interact with XPC and may catalyze XPC SUMOylation (Akita et
  al. 2015).
