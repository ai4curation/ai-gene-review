species: Homo sapiens
summary: The loading of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) leads to recruitment
  of pol delta, the process of polymerase switching. Human PCNA is a homotrimer of
  36 kDa subunits that form a toroidal structure. The loading of PCNA by RFC is a
  key event in the transition from the priming mode to the extension mode of DNA synthesis.
  The processive complex is composed of the pol delta holoenzyme and PCNA (Murakami
  et al.2010). Both PCNA and the DNA polymerase delta are needed for telomeric C-strand
  synthesis in a human telomere replication model (Lormand et al. 2013).
