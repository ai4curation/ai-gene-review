display_name: HCMV Formation of Final Envelopment Complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: VPS4A and CHMP1A components localize within the assembly compartment (AC),
  with a striking colocalization of the chromatin modifying protein 1A (CHMP1A) and
  assembled gM:gN. Both the Vps4A and CHMP1A localized in the vicinity of viral cytoplasmic
  assembly compartments are sites of viral maturation that develop in human cytomeglovirus
  (HCMV)-infected cells. The accumulation of viral tegument also occurs during this
  step of viral maturation.
