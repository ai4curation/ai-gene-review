species: Homo sapiens
summary: Lysosomal degradation of glycoproteins is part of the cellular homeostasis
  of glycosylation (Winchester 2005). The steps outlined below describe the cleavage
  of heparan sulfate/heparin from heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and its degradation.
  Complete degradation of glycoproteins is required to avoid build up of glycosaminoglycan
  fragments which can cause lysosomal storage diseases. The proteolysis of the core
  protein of the glycoprotein is not shown here.
