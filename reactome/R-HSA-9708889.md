  viral protein 6 expressing plasmid (Li JY et al. 2020; Yuen CK et al. 2020; Xia
  H et al. 2020; Miorin L et al. 2020). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that the
  expression of viral 6 (ORF6) protein blocked translocation of interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) to the cell nucleus in poly(I:C)-induced human alveolar basal epithelial
  A549 cells (Xia H et al. 2020) and in Sendai virus (SeV)-induced HEK293 cells (Lei
  X et a. 2020; Yuen CK et al. 2020). The overexpression of ORF6 also blocked the
  nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)
  and STAT2 in HEK293T cells and African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells (Xia H et
  al. 2020; Lei X et a. 2020; Miorin L et al. 2020). Upon activation, IRF3:IRF3, STAT1:STAT1
  or STAT1:STAT2 dimers translocate into the nucleus by binding to the import receptor
  karyopherin (importin) alpha proteins such as KPNA1 which bind to nuclear localization
  signals (NLS) in cargo substrates. KPNA1 in turn interacts with karyopherin (importin)
  β‑1 (KPNB1), which mediates docking of NLS-containing cargo substrate bound to importin
  alpha subunit to the nuclear pore complex (NPC). SARS-CoV-2 6 (ORF6) was found to
  bind KPNA2 blocking IRF3 and STAT nuclear translocation (Xia H et al. 2020). In
  addition, viral ORF6 localized at NPC where it directly interacted with NUP98 and
  RAE1 in ORF6-expressing HEK293T cells (Miorin L et al. 2020; Addetia A et al. 2021;
  Kato K et al. 2021). Mass spectrometry-based proteomics further confirm the 6:NUP98:RAE1
  complex formation (Gordon DE et al. 2020; Meyers JM et al. 2021). Orf6 binding to
  NUP98 is thought to impair docking of he NLS‑cargo:KPNA1:KPNB1 ternary complexes
  at the NPC (Miorin L et al. 2020). Similar findings were reported for SARS-CoV-1
  ORF6 which inhibited IRF3-regulated interferon production (Kopecky-Bromberg SA et
  al. 2007) and antagonized STAT1 function (interferon signalling) by tethering the
  nuclear import factors KPNA2 and KPNB1 to the ER/Golgi membrane (Frieman M et al.
  2007) or by impairing docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex thus
  disrupting nuclear import (Miorin L et al. 2020).<p>In addition to blocking nuclear
  import of host proteins, targeting the NUP98:RAE complex by SARS-CoV-2 6 prevents
