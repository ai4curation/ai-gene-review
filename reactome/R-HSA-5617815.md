stable_id: R-HSA-5617815
display_name: BBSome binds RAB3IP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The BBS1 component of the BBSome complex binds RAB3IP, a GEF for the small
  GTPase RAB8A. RAB3IP is required for RAB8A to localize to the cilium, and depletion
  of RAB3IP compromises cilia formation (Nachury et al, 2007; Loktev et al, 2008).
  GTP-bound RAB8A may promote ciliogenesis by promoting the traffic of post-Golgi
  vesicles to the base of the cilium (Nachury et al, 2007; reviewed in Zerial and
  McBride, 2001; Ishikawa et al, 2011; Hsiao et al, 2012; Sung and Leroux, 2013).
