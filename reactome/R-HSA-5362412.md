display_name: SYVN1 ubiquitinates Hh C-terminal fragments
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SYVN1 ubiquitinates Hh-C as part of the retrotranslocon that targets these
  Hh fragments for degradation through the ERAD pathway.  Both depletion of SYVN1
  by siRNA and expression of a catalytically inactive form of the enzyme strongly
  inhibits Hh-C degradation.  Consistent with this, a dominant negative version of
  SYVN1 abrogates the polyubiquitination of Hh-C as assessed by IP-Western from HEK293
  cells (Chen et al, 2011).
