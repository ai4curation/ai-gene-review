stable_id: R-HSA-5633241
display_name: Defective ALG14 does not transfer GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to GlcNAcDOLP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase subunit ALG14 homolog (ALG14) forms a
  complex with ALG13 protein and is required for the addition of the second N-acetylglucosamine
  (GlcNAc) to the lipid linked oligosaccharide (LLO) intermediate (GlcNAcDOLDP) (Gao
  et al. 2005). Defects in ALG14 can cause congenital myasthenic syndrome (ALG14-CMS),
  which is due to a defect in neuromuscular signal transmission (Cossins et al. 2013).
  The most commonly affected muscles include proximal limb muscles. Mutations causing
  ALG14-CMS include p.P65L and p.R104* (Cossins et al. 2013).
