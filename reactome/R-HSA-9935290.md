display_name: The RNA exosome in RNA exosome:NEXT:ZC3H4:WDR82:CBCA:capped RNA hydrolyzes
  capped RNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The NEXT complex is bound to the RNA cap via ZC3H4. The MTREX (MTR4, SKIV2L2)
  subunit of the NEXT complex recruits the RNA exosome (Lubas et al. 2011, Andersen
  et al. 2013) to hydrolyze substrate RNA by 3'-5' exonuclease activities of the DIS3
  and EXOSC10 subunits of the RNA exosome (Liu et al. 2006, Januszyk et al. 2011,
  Weick et al. 2018, reviewed in Schmid and Jensen 2019, Ogami and Suzuki 2021). The
  RNA exosome degrades pervasive intergenic transcripts after the transcripts have
  dissociated from chromatin (Agostini et al. 2021).
