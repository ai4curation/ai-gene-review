display_name: SARS-CoV-1 7a binds BCL2L1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 1 (SARS-CoV-1) 7a protein
  can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in cell lines derived from different organs,
  including lung, kidney and liver (Tan YJ et al. 2004; Schaecher SR et al. 2007;
  Tan YX et al. 2007). The induction of apoptosis by 7a was blocked by the overexpression
  of the Bcl-2-like protein 1 (BCL2L1, also known as BCLX, Bcl-xL), which is a prosurvival
  member of the Bcl-2 family (Tan YX et al. 2007). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments
  showed that viral 7a interacted with BCL2L1 upon co-expression in human embryonic
  kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and also in SARS-CoV-1-infected African green monkey kidney
  (Vero E6) cells. Subcellular fractionation and localization studies revealed that
  7a colocalized with BCL2L1 at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as the mitochondria
  (Tan YX et al. 2007). The data suggest that SARS-CoV-1 7a induces pro-apoptotic
  signaling through interaction with anti-apoptotic BCL2L1.
