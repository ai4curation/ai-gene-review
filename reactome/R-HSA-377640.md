display_name: Autophosphorylation of SRC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Clustering of Integrin alphaIIb beta3 complexes results in the trans auto-phosphorylation
  of SRC tyrosine residue 419 (often referred to as 418 in the literature, as the
  initiating methionine is cleaved in the mature peptide) in SRC's kinase activation
  loop.
