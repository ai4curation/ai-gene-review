display_name: GPX4-2 reduces 17(S)-Hp-DHA to 17(S)-HDHA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cytosolic phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPX4 isoform
  2, GPX4-2) (Yagi et al. 1996) is a likely candidate for the reduction of organic
  hydroperoxides such as 17(S)-hydroperoxy-docosahexaenoic acid (17(S)-Hp-DHA) to
  17(S)-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17(S)-HDHA) (Han et al. 2013) using glutathione
  (GSH) as an electron donor (Brigelius-Flohe & Maiorino 2013).
