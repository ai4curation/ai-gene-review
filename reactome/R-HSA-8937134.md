stable_id: R-HSA-8937134
display_name: miR-27a binds RUNX1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MicroRNA miR-27a binds the 3'UTR of the RUNX1 mRNA. As miR-27a inhibits translation
  of the RUNX1 mRNA without affecting the RUNX1 mRNA stability, miR-27a is assumed
  to function within the nonendonucleolytic RISC (Ben-Ami et al. 2009).
