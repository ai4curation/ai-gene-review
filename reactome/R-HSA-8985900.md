display_name: p-Y701-STAT1, p-Y705-STAT3, p-Y649-STAT5 dissociates from IL9:p-Y407-IL9R:JAK1:IL2RG:p-904,939-JAK3:p-Y705-STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (STAT1), STAT3
  and STAT5A/STAT5B (collectively termed STAT5) are believed to dissociate from the
  Interleukin 9:Interleukin 9 receptor complex.<br><br>STAT1 (Demoulin et al, 1996),
  STAT3 (Yamasaki et al. 2010) and STAT5 (Demoulin et al. 2000) have been identified
  as parts of complexes associated with DNA in the nucleus following IL9 stimulation.
  All 3 STATs are believed to follow the standard model for STAT signaling, namely
  dissociation from the receptor complex, dimerization and translocation to the nucleus
  (Demoulin et al. 2000, Demoulin et al. 2000, Levy & Darnell 2002).
