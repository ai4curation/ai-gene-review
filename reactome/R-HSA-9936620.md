summary: <p>ATG16L2 binds the complex ATG5:ATG12, as originally shown in a mouse model
  system (Ishibashi et al. 2011) and subsequently confirmed with human proteins (Wible

  of the ATG16L1:ATG5:ATG12 complex and the subsequent formation of autophagosomes
  (Ishibashi et al. 2011, Wible et al. 2019, reviewed in Don Wai Luu et al. 2022).
