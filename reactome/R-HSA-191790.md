display_name: Loading and methylation of Sm proteins onto SMN Complexes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex binds to Sm proteins and small
  nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in the cytoplasm. Sm is part the SMN multiprotein complex
  that contains Gemins 2 – 7, including the DEAD-box RNA helicase Gemin3. The binding
  of the SMN complex to the snRNAs depends on the presence of specific, high-affinity
  (nanomolar) binding domains in the snRNAs. The SMN complex binds the Sm proteins
  through the Sm domains interaction with the Gemins, the TUDOR domain, and through
  unique arginine- and glycine-rich (RG) domains found in three of these, SmB, SmD1
  and SmD3. The association with RG domains is strongly enhanced by the post-translational
  symmetric dimethylation of specific arginines in these domains, a process that is
  carried out by the methylosome (JBP1 or PRMT5) complex.
