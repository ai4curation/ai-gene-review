display_name: Cleavage of Holliday junctions by GEN1 or SLX1A:SLX4:MUS81:EME1,(MUS81:EME2)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Holliday junctions are efficiently cleaved either by GEN1 endonuclease or
  the SLX-MUS complex, composed of the SLX1A:SLX4 heterodimer and the heterodimer
  of MUS81 and EME1 (or, possibly, EME2). Both SLX1A:SLX4 and MUS1:EME1,EME2 possess
  endonucleolytic activity and act in a coordinated fashion. SLX1A:SLX4 cleaves the
  double Holliday junction first, which is followed by MUS81:EME1 (or MUS81:EME2)
  mediated cleavage of the incised Holliday junction. Cleavage by both GEN1 and SLX-MUS
  predominantly leads to exchange of genetic material between sister chromatids, creating
  crossover products (Wyatt et al. 2013, Sarbajna et al. 2014).
