display_name: FN1 aggregation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The binding of integrins to each of the monomers in the FN1 dimer pair is
  thought to trigger a conformational change in FN1 that allows additional FN1 dimers
  to bind without pre-association with integrins (Singh et al. 2010). Domain I1-5
  functions as the primary unit of FN1 matrix assembly (Sottile et al. 1991) but the
  process is not fully characterised and other FN1 units are likely to be involved
  (Singh et al. 2010). In this reaction an arbitrary 10 FN1 monomers are represented
  as being incorporated into the FN1 polymeric matrix. '
