summary: Dimers of ERBB2 and EGF-bound EGFR trans-autophosphorylate on six EGFR tyrosine

  activate downstream signaling cascades (Ricci et al. 1995, Pinkas-Kramarski et al.

  GRB7 (Y1199 and Y1262). Since ERBB3 lacks catalytic activity, it cannot phosphorylate
  ERBB2. Hovewer, since ERBB2:ERBB3 heterodimers usually oligomerize on the cell surface,
  ERBB2 can become trans-autophosphorylated by an adjacent ERBB2 protein. It is not
