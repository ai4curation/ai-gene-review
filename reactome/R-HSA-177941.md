stable_id: R-HSA-177941
display_name: GRB2:GAB1 binds to phosphorylated EGFR
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The regulatory subunit of PIK3 mediates the association of GAB1 and receptor
  protein-tyrosine kinases such as the  EGF receptor, which can phosphorylate GAB1.
  It appears that the PIK3 regulatory subunit acts as an adaptor protein allowing
  GAB1 to serve as a substrate for several tyrosine kinases.
