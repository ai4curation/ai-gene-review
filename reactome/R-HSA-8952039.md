summary: 'UBE2F is specific for the CUL5:RBX2-containing E3 ligase complex (Huang
  et al, 2009; Monda et al, 2013).  Interaction between UBE2F and the CUL5 E3 complex
  is facilitated by a DCUN1D (also known as DCNL) scaffold protein, of which there

  Monda et al, 2013; Keuss et al, 2016). DCUN1D proteins interact with higher affinity
  to the N-terminally acetylated forms of UBE2F and UBE2M (Scott et al, 2011; Monda
  et al, 2013). Although each of the 5 DCUN1D proteins appears to interact with most
  cullin subtypes, specificity may arise through differences in expression and localization,
