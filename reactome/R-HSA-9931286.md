display_name: CD274 N-linked glycosylation in ER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PD-L1 (CD274) glycosylation plays a critical role in determining the protein
  function and stability. PD-L1 is N-glycosylated at N192, N200 and N219 by the OST
  complex (STT3A and STT3A) in the ER lumen. This process is important for PD-L1 stability
  and inhibits its targeting for proteasomal degradation by GSK3B (Li et al., 2016,
  Hsu et al., 2018). Also, JAK1 activated by the IL6 pathway positively regulate the
  glycosylation process by aiding in the recruitment of  endoplasmic reticulum-associated
  N-glycosyltransferase STT3A (part of the OST-A complex) to catalyse PD-L1 glycosylation
  (Chan et al., 2019).
