summary: Autosomal recessive IRAK4 deficiency leads to impaired TLR responses in leukocytes
  and is associated with increased susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections
  in childhood (Picard C et al. 2010, 2011; Medvedev AE et al. 2003; Yamamoto T et
  al. 2014). Here we describe two nonsense mutations IRAK4 Q293* and IRAK4 E402* that
  create premature stop codons leading to abolished IRAK4 production (Picard C et
  al. 2003; Ku CL et al. 2007; Yamamoto T et al. 2014). This Reactome event also describes
  the missense IRAK4 R12C variant with protein level comparable to wild type (WT)
  when expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293T) cells (Ku CL et al. 2007;
  Yamamoto T et al. 2014). Analytical gel filtration of recombinant WT or mutant IRAK4
  and MyD88 proteins revealed that IRAK4 R12C failed to form a complex with MyD88.
  These results are in agreement with a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titration
  study that showed a lower affinity of IRAK4 R12C variant towards 1H-15N-labeled
  MyD88 N-terminal domain (Yamamoto T et al. 2014). These IRAK4 variants (Q293*, E402*
  and R12C) have been shown to compromise TLR2 and TLR4 signaling in response to their
  agonists Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2), Pam2CSK4 (TLR2/6) and LPS (TLR4) (Ku CL et al. 2007;
  Yamamoto T et al. 2014; De S et al., 2018).
