display_name: CR1 gene expression is stimulated by RUNX1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Binding of the RUNX1:CBFB complex to the promoter of the CR1 (CD35) gene
  stimulates CR1 transcription. The CR1 gene encodes Complement receptor type 1. Binding
  of an ETS family member to an ETS site adjacent to the RUNX1 site in the CR1 gene
  promoter probably contributes to CR1 expression (Kim et al. 1999, Rho et al. 2004).

## Summary

Binding of the RUNX1:CBFB complex to the promoter of the CR1 (CD35) gene stimulates CR1 transcription. The CR1 gene encodes Complement receptor type 1. Binding of an ETS family member to an ETS site adjacent to the RUNX1 site in the CR1 gene promoter probably contributes to CR1 expression (Kim et al. 1999, Rho et al. 2004).
