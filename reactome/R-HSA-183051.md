stable_id: R-HSA-183051
display_name: CBL ubiquitinates Sprouty
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Sprouty is ubiquitinated by CBL in an EGF-dependent manner. EGF stimulation
  induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of Sprouty, which in turn enhances the interaction
  of Sprouty with CBL. The CBL-mediated ubiquitination of Sprouty targets the protein
  for degradation by the 26S proteasome.
