display_name: LRP2-mediated uptake of extracellular CUBN:GC:25(OH)D
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Megalin (LRP2, glycoprotein 330) is a member of the low density lipoprotein
  receptor family and is abundant in kidney proximal tubules (Kounnas et al. 1995,
  Hjalm et al. 1996). LRP2 complexed with LDLRAP1 (low density lipoprotein receptor
  adapter protein 1, aka ARH) mediates the endocytic uptake of GC:25(OH)D complexes,
  thereby preventing the loss of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol, 25(OH)D) in urine
  (Nykjaer  et al. 1999, Kaseda et al. 2011).
