summary: 'The first crucial event in autophagy is the induction or nucleation of the

  structures on the ER. LC3-positive membranes were observed to emerge from these
  structures, and named omegasomes as they resembled the Greek letter omega (Axe et
  al. 2008). 3D tomographic imaging of isolation membranes have shown cup-shaped isolation
  membranes sandwiched between two sheets of ER, connected by a narrow membrane tube
  (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009, Yla-Anttila et al. 2009) suggesting that isolation
  membrane formation and elongation may be guided by the adjacent ER sheets (Shibutani

  the PAS in an Atg1 dependent manner, where Atg1 mediated phosphorylation of Atg9
  facilitates the recruitment of Atg8 and Atg18 and subsequent phagophore expansion
  (Papinski et al. 2014). Vesicular or tubular trafficking from recycling endosomes
  might is thought to feed ATG9  and ATG16L1 positive membrane onto the growing phagophore
  in a process that appears to be regulated by the PX BAR protein SNX18 and by the

## Summary

The first crucial event in autophagy is the induction or nucleation of the membrane that will become an autophagosome. This is also the least well understood step (Tooze & Yoshimuri 2010). Following PI3P enrichment of the membrane, the associated membrane is distinct from its precursor and considered to be a new cellular structure, called a phagophore or an isolation membrane. Though the origins of this membrane are not unequivocally established, recent studies using mammalian cells indicate a strong relationship between autophagosome formation sites and the ER. The PI3P binding protein DFCP1 is localized to the ER. In starved cells it forms dot-like structures on the ER. LC3-positive membranes were observed to emerge from these structures, and named omegasomes as they resembled the Greek letter omega (Axe et al. 2008). 3D tomographic imaging of isolation membranes have shown cup-shaped isolation membranes sandwiched between two sheets of ER, connected by a narrow membrane tube (Hayashi-Nishino et al. 2009, Yla-Anttila et al. 2009) suggesting that isolation membrane formation and elongation may be guided by the adjacent ER sheets (Shibutani & Yoshimuri 2014).
