display_name: DSPG and CSPG translocate to the lysosome for degradation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: As part of the natural turnover of GAGs, extracellular KSPGs translocate
  to the lysosome to be degraded. The translocation process is unsure but could be
  either endocytosis from outside the cell or autophagy from inside the cell (Winchester
  2005).

## Summary

As part of the natural turnover of GAGs, extracellular KSPGs translocate to the lysosome to be degraded. The translocation process is unsure but could be either endocytosis from outside the cell or autophagy from inside the cell (Winchester 2005).
