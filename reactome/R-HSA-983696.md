display_name: The Immunoglobulin of the BCR binds antigen
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mature, unstimulated B cells express IgM and IgD immunoglobulins on their
  surfaces (Fu et al. 1974, Fu et al. 1975, reviewed in Kunkel 1975). The immunoglobulins
  form B cell receptor (BCR) complexes with disulfide-linked heterodimers of Ig-alpha
  (CD79A) and Ig-beta (CD79B), which have cytoplasmic tails containing immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) (van Noesel et al. 1992, Saouaf et al.
  1995, inferred from mouse Hombach et al. 1990, Wienands et al. 1990).  Upon binding
  of antigen to the immunoglobulin a chain of phosphorylation events is triggered
  (Nel et al. 1984, Saouaf et al. 1994, Hata et al. 1994, Saouaf et al. 1995, reviewed
  in Harwood and Batista 2010).
