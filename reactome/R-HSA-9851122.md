display_name: p-Y705,S727 STAT3 dimer binds NOTCH gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Phosphorylated STAT3 binds to the promoter of the NOTCH gene downstream of
  NPM1-ALK signaling in ALCL as assessed by chromatin coimmunoprecipitation (ChIP).
  NPM1-ALK-dependent NOTCH expression contributes to cellular proliferation and abrogation
  of NOTCH signaling through treatment with either short hairpin RNAs or gamma secretase
  inhibitors leads to apoptosis (Larose et al, 2021).

## Summary

Phosphorylated STAT3 binds to the promoter of the NOTCH gene downstream of NPM1-ALK signaling in ALCL as assessed by chromatin coimmunoprecipitation (ChIP). NPM1-ALK-dependent NOTCH expression contributes to cellular proliferation and abrogation of NOTCH signaling through treatment with either short hairpin RNAs or gamma secretase inhibitors leads to apoptosis (Larose et al, 2021).
