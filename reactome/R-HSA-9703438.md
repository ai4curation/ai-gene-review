stable_id: R-HSA-9703438
display_name: FLT3 fusions phosphorylate GAB2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GAB2 is presumed to be phosphorylated downstream of active FLT3 fusion proteins,
  but this has not been directly demonstrated. ETV6-FLT3 is unable to transform primary
  myeloid cells from the bone marrow of Gab2-/- mice, implicating signaling through
  this pathway (Chonabayashi et al, 2013).
