display_name: ISGF3 binds the ISRE promoter elements in IFN-stimulated genes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Effects of IFNs result from induction of a subset of genes, called IFN stimulated
  genes (ISGs). These ISGs are mainly implicated in anti-viral, anti-angiogenic, immunomodulatory,
  cell cycle inhibitory effects and apoptotic functions. All IFNA/B-stimulated genes
  have a conserved region of about 15bp in their promoter called the Interferon Stimulation
  Response Element (ISRE). The transcription factor ISGF3 binds to this ISRE and induce
  the transcription of these genes by IFN.
