species: Homo sapiens
summary: G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) sense extracellular signals and activate
  different Guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). Upon activation, GPCRs
  can replace the GDP with GTP in the alpha subunit of G proteins. GTP binding modifies
  the conformation of G alpha proteins and activates them. The Regulator of G protein
  Signalling (RGS) are GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs) that can directly inhibit
  the G alpha subunit activity. There are at least 25 different types of RGS proteins
  known. Several of these RGS proteins (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21)
  can bind and stabilize the transition state of Guanine nucleotide binding protein
  G(q) subunit alpha class (GNAQ/GNA11/GNA14/GNA15).  Subsequently, the RGS domain
  in the complex facilitates the hydrolyses of G alpha (q):GTP to G alpha (q):GDP.
  Following this, the complex dissociates releasing inactive G alpha (q) (Neubig &
  Siderovski 2002, Kach et al. 2012). The primary function of G alpha (q) is activation
  of phospholipase C beta thereby triggering phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium
  mobilization and protein kinase C activation.
