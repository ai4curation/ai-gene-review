display_name: Formation of the 19S regulatory particle base precursor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Following the formation of PSMD10:PSMC4:PSMC5:PAAF1, PSMD9:PSMC3:PSCM6, and
  PSMD5:PSMC2:PSMC1:PSMD2 modules of the base of the proteasome 19S regulatory particle
  (19S RP), they associate with one another, along with binding of PSMD1 (ortholog
  of yeast Rpn2) and ADRM1 (ortholog of yeast Rpn13), and release of PSMD9 (Nas2/p27),
  to form the base precursor. ATPase subunits of the base, Rpt1-6 in yeast, and PSMC1
  (Rpt2), PSMC2 (Rpt1), PSMC3 (Rpt4), PSMC4 (Rpt6), PSMC5 (Rpt3) and PSMC6 (Rpt5)
  in human 19S RP, are required not only for substrate unfolding using energy released
  by ATP hydrolysis, but also for a ring channel opening in the 20S core particle
  (20S CP). The order of the base precursor assembly has not been fully elucidated.
  PAAF1, PSMD10, and PSMD2 can be found bound to the fully assembled 19S regulatory
  particle (19S RP) but not to the 26S proteasome, suggesting that they are normally
  released prior to or during 19S RP binding to the 20S core particle (20S CP) (reviewed
  in Tomko and Hochstrasse 2013).<br><br>Study of the assembly of human 19S RP base
  shows that the PSMD9 module is the last to incorporate during the base formation
  and that PSMD9 likely prevents premature association of the PSMC3:PSMC6 dimer with
  the base (Kaneko et al. 2009). The PSMC3:PSMC6 dimer is likely needed for the association
  of PSMD1 (Rpn2) with the base, and binding of PSMD1 to the base appears to be mutually
  exclusive with binding of PSMD9 (Kaneko et al. 2009).<br><br>PSMD1 provides a docking
  site for ADRM1 (ortholog of yeast Rpn13) and enables recruitment of ADRM1, which
  serves as a ubiquitin receptor, to the proteasome base (Hamazaki et al. 2006; Chen
  et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2015; Lu et al. 2017; VanderLinden et al. 2017). The interaction
  between ADRM1 and PSMD1 may be regulated by PSMD1 SUMOylation (Ryu et al. 2014)
  and phosphorylation (Hemmis et al. 2019).
