display_name: TPX2 promotes AURKA autophosphorylation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TPX2 promotes aurora kinase A (AURKA) activation via autophosphorylation
  of AURKA on threonine residue T288. Continuous association of TPX2 with AURKA facilitates
  active state conformation of AURKA and may prevent inactivation of AURKA by protein
  phosphatases (Bayliss et al. 2003).<p>Molecular dynamic simulations suggest the
  existence of two TPX2-dependent switches for Aurora A activation. 1) TPX2 binding
  to Aurora A forces lysine residue K143 of AURKA into an “open” state, which pulls
  ADP out of the ATP binding site in AURKA to promote kinase activation. 2) Arginine
  residue R180 of AURKA undergoes a “closed” movement upon TPX2 binding, thus capturing
  phosphorylated threonine T288 of AURKA into a buried position and locking AURKA
  in its active conformation. The existence of two TPX2-dependent switches in AURKA
  activation was further verified by the analysis of two AURKA mutants (K143A and
  R180A) (Xu et al. 2011).AURKA activation is enabled through phosphorylation and
  TPX2 binding; these two activating switches act synergistically and withough a predefined
  order (Dodson and Bayliss 2012).
