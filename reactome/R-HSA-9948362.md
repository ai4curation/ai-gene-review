display_name: LTN1 K48 polyubiquitinates the nascent peptide in NEMF:60S ribosomal
  subunit:peptidyl-tRNA with nascent peptide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: LTN1 ubiquitinates exposed lysine residues on the nascent peptide after the
  residues emerge from the exit tunnel of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Shao et al. 2013,
  Shao and Hegde 2014, Osuna et al. 2017, Kuroha et al. 2018, Abaeva et al. 2025,
  inferred from yeast homologs in Bengtson and Joazeiro 2010). LTN1 is able to use
  UBE2D1 as the E2 ubiquitin donor in vitro (Abaeva et al. 2025). TCF25, the human
  homolog of RQC1 in yeast, interacts with the RING domain of LTN1 to orient the ubiquitin
  substrate molecules to produce K48 linkages in the polyubiquitin product (Kuroha
  et al. 2018, Abaeva et al. 2025).

## Summary

LTN1 ubiquitinates exposed lysine residues on the nascent peptide after the residues emerge from the exit tunnel of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Shao et al. 2013, Shao and Hegde 2014, Osuna et al. 2017, Kuroha et al. 2018, Abaeva et al. 2025, inferred from yeast homologs in Bengtson and Joazeiro 2010). LTN1 is able to use UBE2D1 as the E2 ubiquitin donor in vitro (Abaeva et al. 2025).
