display_name: CALM1:Ca2+ binds CNG channel
species: Homo sapiens
summary: As the channels reopen, rising Ca2+ levels result in binding of Ca2+  to
  calmodulin (CALM1). By targeting the beta subunit of the channel, CALM1:Ca2+ reduces
  the apparent affinity of the channel for cGMP (Chen et al. 1994, Hsu & Molday 1993,
  Hsu & Molday 1994).
