stable_id: R-HSA-6783524
display_name: OSM,LIF,CTF1 receptor complex binds gp130
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Glycoprotein (gp)130 is the common signal transducer for LIF, OSM and CTF1
  receptor complexes. gp130/OSMRbeta complex is used solely by OSM, the gp130/LIFR
  complex is shared by the three receptors LIF, OSM and CTF1. Binding of OSM to either
  the gp130/LIFR or the gp130/OSMRbeta complex triggers the activation of multiple
  members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family.
