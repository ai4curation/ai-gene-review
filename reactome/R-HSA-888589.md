stable_id: R-HSA-888589
display_name: Release of GABA at the synapse
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GABA synaptic vesicles are fused to the presynaptic terminal membrane with
  the help of SNARE complex proteins, synaptobrevin located in the synaptic vesicle,
  SNAP 25 and syntaxin located in the plasma membrane. Complexin optimizes partially
  assembled SNARES for Ca2+ dependent exocytosis. Fusion of the synaptic vesicle is
  triggered by the influx of Ca2+ through N, P/Q Ca2+ channels, which binds to synaptobrevin
  on the synaptic vesicles triggering a series of steps leading to fusion of the synaptic
  vesicle to the presynatic terminal membrane and release of GABA.
