display_name: NOTCH precursor cleaved to form mature NOTCH
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The NOTCH receptor is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide (approx. 300
  kDa) associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The mature NOTCH receptor
  is produced by proteolytic cleavage to form a heterodimer. The enzyme responsible
  is a furin-like convertase which cleaves the full-length precursor into a transmembrane
  fragment (NTM) of approximate size 110 kDa and an extracellular fragment (NEC) of
  approximate size 180 kDa. The mature NOTCH receptor is reassembled as a heterodimer
  (Blaumueller et al. 1997, Logeat et al. 1998). Both disulfide bonds and calcium-mediated
  ionic interactions stabilize the heterodimer (Rand et al. 2000, Gordon et al. 2009).
  This process takes place in the trans-Golgi network . Mammalian NOTCH is predominantly
  presented as a heterodimer on the cell surface. Although FURIN-mediated cleavage
  is evolutionarily conserved, it may not be mandatory for Drosophila Notch function
  (Kidd et al. 2002).
