display_name: RQT complex:K63polyUb-80S ribosome dissociates yielding K63polyUb-40S
  subunit and 60S subunit:peptidyl-tRNA with nascent peptide
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The ribosome quality control trigger (RQT) complex (ASCC2:TRIP4:ASCC3, homologous
  to the CUE3:RAT4:SLH1 complex from yeast, Sitron et al. 2017, Matsuo et al. 2017),
  splits stalled 80S K63-polyubiquitinated ribosomes into 60S subunits and K63-polyubiquitinated
  40S subunits (Hashimoto et al. 2020, Juszkiewicz et al. 2020, Narita et al. 2022,
  Miścicka et al. 2024). The cryo-EM structure of the CUE3:RAT4:SLH1 complex in yeast
  indicates that the SLH1 subunit (homologus to ASCC3) may apply an ATP-powered pulling
  force on the mRNA to dissociate the 80S ribosome into 40S and 60S subunits (inferred
  from yeast homologs in Best et al. 2023). The peptidyl-tRNA containing the nascent
  peptide remains at the P site of the 60S subunit. The mRNA dissociates from the
  ribosomal subunits and is thought to be degraded at this time. In the case of collided
  yeast ribosomes, the mRNA is first endonucleolytically cleaved by Cue2 (mammalian
  homolog N4BP2) and the cleavage products are exonucleolytically degraded by XRN1
  and the exosome (Ikeuchi et al. 2019).

The ribosome quality control trigger (RQT) complex (ASCC2:TRIP4:ASCC3, homologous to the CUE3:RAT4:SLH1 complex from yeast, Sitron et al. 2017, Matsuo et al. 2017), splits stalled 80S K63-polyubiquitinated ribosomes into 60S subunits and K63-polyubiquitinated 40S subunits (Hashimoto et al. 2020, Juszkiewicz et al. 2020, Narita et al. 2022, Miścicka et al. 2024).
