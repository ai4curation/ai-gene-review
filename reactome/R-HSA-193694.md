species: Homo sapiens
summary: NGF binding to p75NTR induces recruitment of the atypical PKC interacting
  protein, p62, necessary for coupling IKKbeta with p75NTR. The kinase activity of
  IRAK1 is necessary for p62 (sequestosome-1) recruitment. IRAK1 interaction with
  TRAF6 precedes (1 min) its interaction with p62 (5 min). p62 has two protein interaction
  domains, named UBA and PB1. The UBA domain binds non-covalently to polyubiquitin
  chains. The PB1 domain has structural homology with the UbL (ubiquitin like) domain,
  and is able to interact with the 26S proteasome subunit Rpt1. Other  protein interaction
  domains also exist within p62, suggesting that it may have a role in the formation
  of multimeric signalling complexes.p62 forms a complex with TRAF6, which involves
  the two domains PB1 at the p62 C-terminal end, and UBA, at the N-terminus.
