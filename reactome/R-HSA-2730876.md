display_name: Phosphorylation of IKK-beta by TAK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In humans, the IkB kinase (IKK) complex serves as the master regulator for
  the activation of NF-kB by various stimuli. It contains two catalytic subunits,
  IKK alpha and IKK beta, and a regulatory subunit, IKKgamma/NEMO. The activation
  of IKK complex is dependent on the phosphorylation of IKK alpha/beta at its activation
  loop and the K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO. This basic trimolecular complex
  is referred to as the IKK complex. <br>IKK subunits have a N-term kinase domain
  a leucine zipper (LZ) motifs, a helix-loop-helix (HLH) and a C-ter NEMO binding
  domain (NBD). IKK catalytic subunits are dimerized through their LZ motifs.  IKK
  beta is the major IKK catalytic subunit for NF-kB activation. Activated TAK1 phosphorylate
  IKK beta on S177 and S181 (S176 and S180 in IKK alpha) in the activation loop and
  thus activate the IKK kinase activity, leading to the IkB alpha phosphorylation
  and NF-kB activation.
