summary: The cytosolic phosphorylase kinase complex catalyzes the phosphorylation
  of glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL). Two forms of phosphorylase kinase complex have
  been described (Brushia and Walsh 1999). The one annotated here, consisting of four

  (Burwinkel et al. 2003a), PHKG2 (gamma catalytic) (Burwinkel et al. 2003b; Maichele
  et al. 2006) and CALM (calmodulin) subunits is abundant in liver and its action
  on the form of phosphorylase (PYGL) abundant in liver is described.<p>While initial
  studies of glycogen phosphorylase PGYM from rabbit muscle suggested that it is a
  homotetramer (Keller and Cori 1953), more recent work indicates that under physiological
  conditions the enzyme occurs as a homodimer (Huang and Graves 1970) and a dimeric
  structure for human PYGL enzyme is inferred here.
