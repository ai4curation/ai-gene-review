display_name: Syndecan-4:PI(4,5)P2 binds PKC alpha:DAG
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Syndecans have attached heparan sulfate (HS) and to a lesser extent chondroitin
  sulfate (CS) chains. These allow interactions with a large number of proteins. Various
  enzymes involved in post-translational HS chain modifications produce unique binding
  motifs that selectively recognize different proteins (Tkachenko et al. 2005). <br><br>Syndecans
  are also signalling molecules, interacting with cytoplasmic proteins. Most of the
  work done has involved syndecan-4 (Multhaupt et al. 2009). Zebrafish and murine
  syndecan-4 V regions bind the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  (PI(4,5)P2) undergoing a shape change revealed by NMR spectroscopy (Oh et al. 1998,
  Whiteford et al. 2008). The resulting complex is able to bind protein kinase C alpha
  which is persistently activated in the absence of Ca2+ (Oh et al. 1997, Lee et al.
  1998, Keum et al. 2004).
