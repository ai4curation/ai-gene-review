stable_id: R-HSA-5607744
display_name: MALT1 binds BCL10
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1)
  is the main downstream target of BCL10. MALT1 interacts directly with BCL10 and
  this interaction involves a short stretch of amino acids that follow the BCL10 CARD
  motif (amino acids 107–119 of human BCL10) and the two immunoglobulin-like domains
  of MALT1 (Uren et al. 2000, Lucas et al. 2001).
