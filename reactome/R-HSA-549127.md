display_name: SLC-mediated transport of organic cations
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The organic cation transporters comprise three SLC22 members, OCT1-3. They
  can transport a wide range of organic cations including weak bases. All transport
  by OCTs is electrogenic, sodium-independent and bidirectional. Two further organic
  cation transporters mediate transport of ergothioneine and carnitine (Koepsell H
  and Endou H, 2004).
