stable_id: R-HSA-9701003
display_name: BAP1 binds BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimer
species: Homo sapiens
summary: BAP1 binds to the BRCA1:BARD1 complex mainly through interaction with BARD1,
  although BRCA1 enhances the interaction. Amino acid residues 182-365 of BAP1 bind
  to the RING domain of BARD1, but outside of the BRCA1-binding site in the BARD1
  RING domain (Nishikawa et al. 2009).
