stable_id: R-HSA-379867
display_name: aspartate + tRNA(Asp) + ATP => Asp-tRNA(Asp) + AMP + pyrophosphate
species: Homo sapiens
summary: DARS (cytosolic aspartyl tRNA synthetase) catalyzes the reaction of aspartate,
  tRNA(Asp), and ATP to form Asp-tRNA(Asp), AMP, and pyrophosphate. The enzyme, a
  class II tRNA synthetase, is a homodimer found in the cell as a component of the
  mutienzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (Escalante and Yang 1993).
