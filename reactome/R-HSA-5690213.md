display_name: DNA polymerases delta, epsilon or kappa bind the GG-NER site
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The DNA repair synthesis complex, consisting of PCNA, RFC, RPA and polymerase
  delta (POLD) or epsilon (POLE) complexes, or DNA translesion synthesis polymerase
  kappa (POLK) (Ogi et al. 2010), is formed at the nucleotide excision repair (NER)
  site following the incision of the damaged DNA strand 5' to the lesion by the ERCC1:ERCC4
  (ERCC1:XPF) complex. 3' incision by XPG (ERCC5) is not required for the loading
  of the DNA polymerases and may not be required for the initiation of NER-mediated
  DNA synthesis (Staresincic et al. 2009). XPG and RPA promote the assembly of the
  DNA synthesis complex at the NER site (Mocquet et al. 2008).
