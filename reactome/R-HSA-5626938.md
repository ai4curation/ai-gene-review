display_name: Beta-catenin binds SOX proteins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SOX protein family members are the transcription factors that regulate many
  different development processes and also control homeostasis in adult tissues. SOX
  proteins can be either transcriptional activators or repressors depending on the
  cellular context and their associated interacting proteins (Kormish et al. 2010).
  There are over twenty SOX proteins encoded in mammalian genome of which many of
  these can physically interact with beta-catenin and TCF (T-cell factor) transcription
  factors and modulate the Wnt signaling. Evidences suggest that SOX proteins have
  widespread role in modulating Wnt signaling in development and disease. In most
  cases SOX proteins repress WNT transcriptional responses, however some SOX proteins
  appear to enhance WNT-regulated gene expression. The precise mechanism by which
  SOX proteins regulate beta-catenin/TCF activity are still unclear. Differential
  recruitment of transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors is one mechanism by
  which SOX factors can either enhance or repress Wnt-target gene transcription. Another
  mechanism by which some SOX proteins repress Wnt signaling is by promoting proteosome-mediated
  beta-catenin degradation (Kormish et al. 2010). <br>Human SRY binds beta-catenin
  through a N-terminal domain (Bernard et al. 2008), SOX6 interacts via a centrally
  located leucine zipper (LZ/Q) element (Iguchi et al. 2007), and mammalian SOX7,
  SOX9 and SOX17 all bind beta-catenin via their C-terminal regions (Zorn et al.,
  1999; Takash et al., 2001; Akiyama et al., 2004; Sinner et al., 2007, Kormish et
  al. 2010). SRY and SOX9 function in part by suppressing canonical Wnt signaling
  by promoting beta-catenin phosphorylation in the nucleus (Topol et al. 2009). SOX9
  and SRY are involved in the regulation of mammalian sex determination and mutation
  in human SRY and SOX9 results in sex reversal, with female development in XY individuals
  (Bernard et al. 2008). SOX2 binds beta-catenin and promotes cell proliferation by
  transcriptionally activating the Wnt target Cyclin D1 gene in breast cancer cells
  (Chen et al., 2008), whereas SOX6 represses Cyclin D1 transcription in pancreatic
  cells (Iguchi et al., 2007). SOX7 and SOX17 reduce cyclin-D1 expression and repress
  proliferation by stimulating beta-catenin degradation (Sinner et al. 2007, Zhang
  et al. 2008, 2009).
