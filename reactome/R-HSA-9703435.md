display_name: FLT3 fusions activate STAT5
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Active FLT3 fusions promote signaling through the STAT5 pathway as assessed
  by Western blotting against phosphorylated STAT5 (Grand et al, 2007; Vu et al, 2009;
  Chonabayashi et al, 2013; reviewed in Kazi and Roonstrand, 2019). In studies with
  the ETV6-FLT3 fusion EF1, STAT5 activation was shown to depend on tyrosine residues
  in the juxtamembrane domain and tyrosine kinase domain 1 region of FLT3 (Vu et al,
  2009).
