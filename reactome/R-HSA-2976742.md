stable_id: R-HSA-2976742
display_name: NOTCH2 coactivator complex binds FCER2 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The promoter of FCER2 (CD23A) contains several RBPJ (CSL i.e. CBF) binding
  sites that are occupied by RBPJ transcription complexes that contain NICD2, but
  not NICD1. The association of NICD2 with RBPJ promoter elements of FCER2 gene was
  demonstrated by electromobility shift assays on nuclear extracts of human B-cell
  chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells (Hubmann et al. 2002).
