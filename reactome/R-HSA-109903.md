stable_id: R-HSA-109903
display_name: cytidine or uridine + ATP => CMP or UMP + ADP [UCK2]
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Cytosolic uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) catalyzes the reactions of cytidine
  or uridine with ATP to form CMP or UMP and ADP (Greenberg et al. 1977; Van Rompay
  et al. 2001). Crystallographic data show the enzyme to be a tetramer (Suzuki et
  al. 2004). When it is expressed as a fusion construct with green fluorescent protein,
  the protein localizes primarily to the cytosol of transfected CHO cells (Van Rompay
  et al. 2003).
