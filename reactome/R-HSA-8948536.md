display_name: PTENP1 mRNA binds miR-20 RISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PTENP1 mRNA is the product of the PTEN pseudogene PTENP1 and is highly homologous
  to PTEN mRNA. PTENP1 mRNA contains a perfect match for the miR-20 family of microRNAs,
  which target PTEN mRNA for degradation. miR-20a was shown to suppress both PTENP1
  and PTEN transcript levels, and it is possible that miR-20b functions in a similar
  manner.<br>Overexpression of PTENP1 3'UTR results in de-repression of both PTEN
  mRNA and protein in the presence of mature PTEN-targeting microRNAs. Knockdown of
  PTENP1 decreases abundance of PTEN mRNA and protein. PTENP1 therefore functions
  as a competing endogenous RNA (ce-RNA) in microRNA-mediated PTEN regulation. PTENP1
  losses have been reported in cancer (Poliseno et al. 2010).
