display_name: 18SE pre-rRNA in pre-40S particles is nucleolytically processed during
  translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Exonuclease activity of the exosome (Preti et al. 2013) and endonuclease
  activity of  NOB1 (inferred from yeast, Pertschy et al. 2009) process the 3' end
  of precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) 18SE to yield mature 18S rRNA. During the processing,
  pre-rRNA 18SE is bound in the pre-40S ribosome subunit, which contains ribosomal
  proteins and processing factors such as NOB1 and BYSL. The pre-40S subunit is exported
  from the nucleus to the cytosol where processing factors are released and recycled
  back to the nucleus. The kinases RIOK1, RIOK2, CSNK1D and CSNK1E are associated
  with the pre-40S rRNA subunit in both the nucleus and cytosol and their kinase activity
  is required for recycling of processing factors back to the nucleus (Zemp et al.
  2009, Zemp et al. 2014). RIOK1 and RIOK2 are also required for 18SE processing (Widmann
  et al. 2012, Zemp et al. 2009). RIOK3 (RIO3) is a cytosolic kinase that associates
  with the pre-40S ribosomal particle after export from the nucleus and is required
  for release of processing factors (Baumas et al. 2012).
