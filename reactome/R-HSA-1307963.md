display_name: Autocatalytic phosphorylation of BetaKlotho-bound FGFR4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After being bound by BetaKlotho and FGF19, FGFR4 undergoes autophosphorylation
  on tyrosine residues in the intracellular portion of the receptor.  The phosphorylation
  sites on FGFR4 have not been accurately determined in vitro or in vivo but are predicted
  based on sequence comparison with the other FGF receptors.

## Summary

After being bound by BetaKlotho and FGF19, FGFR4 undergoes autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues in the intracellular portion of the receptor.  The phosphorylation sites on FGFR4 have not been accurately determined in vitro or in vivo but are predicted based on sequence comparison with the other FGF receptors.
