summary: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR is a chloride channel in the apical membrane
  of epithelial cells where it functions to maintain salt and fluid homeostasis. CF
  is the most common autosomal recessive disease in Caucasian populations. It is a
  life-limiting condition, with respiratory failure secondary to end-stage lung disease
  as the main cause of mortality. The majority of disease-causing mutations lead to
  misfolding of CFTR, including the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508, F508del,
  occurring in around 90% of patient alleles. Misfolding results in a defective channel
  where the mutant protein is either released to the cell surface, where it displays
  dysfunctionality, or is retained in the ER and translocated into the cytosol for
  degradation by the proteasome.<br><br>CFTR correctors have been developed that rescue
  misfolded mutant CFTRs from the ER that can then translocate to the cell surface
  to allow any mutant to gain functionality (Mijnders et al. 2017). Small molecule
  CFTR correctors such as the approved drugs elexacaftor, lumacaftor and tezacaftor
  and the next-generation corrector bamocaftor have the potential to improve up to
  90% of CF patients with the F508del mutation when combined with a CFTR potentiator
  such as ivacaftor (Keating et al. 2018, Davies et al. 2018, Heijerman et al. 2019).
