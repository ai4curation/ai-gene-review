display_name: The cofactor BH4 is required for electron transfer in the eNOS catalytic
  cycle
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) ensures endothelial nitric oxide synthase
  (eNOS) couples electron transfer to L-arginine oxidation (Berka et al. 2004). During
  catalysis, electrons derived from NADPH transfer to the flavins FAD and FMN in the
  reductase domain of eNOS and then on to the ferric heme in the oxygenase domain
  of eNOS. BH4 can donate an electron to intermediates in this electron transfer and
  is oxidised in the process, forming the BH3 radical. This radical can be reduced
  back to BH4 by iron, completing the cycle and forming ferrous iron again. Heme reduction
  enables O2 binding and L-arginine oxidation to occur within the oxygenase domain
  (Stuehr et al. 2009).

## Summary

The cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) ensures endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) couples electron transfer to L-arginine oxidation (Berka et al. 2004). During catalysis, electrons derived from NADPH transfer to the flavins FAD and FMN in the reductase domain of eNOS and then on to the ferric heme in the oxygenase domain of eNOS. BH4 can donate an electron to intermediates in this electron transfer and is oxidised in the process, forming the BH3 radical. This radical can be reduced back to BH4 by iron, completing the cycle and forming ferrous iron again. Heme reduction enables O2 binding and L-arginine oxidation to occur within the oxygenase domain (Stuehr et al. 2009).
