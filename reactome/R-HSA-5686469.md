## Summary

Based on studies in yeast, D-loop cleavage by MUS81 in complex with EME1 or EME2 always produces crossovers between sister chromatids (Osman et al. 2003). The identity of the DNA polymerase(s) and ligase(s) that complete DNA repair synthesis and ligation after MUS81:EME1 or MUS81:EME2 cleavage of D-loops has not been determined.
