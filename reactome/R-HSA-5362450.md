display_name: Hh processing variants bind lectins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Like the WT C-terminal fragment of Hh, processing-defective variant precursors
  of full-length Hh are also targetted for degradation by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated
  degradtion (ERAD) pathway (Chen et al, 2011; Huang et al, 2013).  This pathway delivers
  N-glycosylated ER-resident substrates to a retrotranslocation channel, where they
  are ubiquitinated and translocated to the cytosol for proteasome-mediated degradation
  in an ATP-ase dependent fashion (reviewed in Vembar and Brodsky, 2008).  Recognition
  and targetting of ER proteins for the ERAD pathway depends at least in part by modification
  and binding of the glycosyl groups, and as is the case for the WT C-terminal fragment,  lectins
  OS9 and ERLEC1 are required for the degradation of processing-defective variants
  of Hh (Chen et al, 2011).  OS9 and ERLEC1 may target substrates to the retrotranslocation
  channel by virtue of their interaction SEL1, an ER membrane protein with established
  roles in the ERAD pathway (Christianson et al, 2008; Mueller et al, 2008; Hosokawa
  et al, 2008; Hosokawa et al, 2009).
