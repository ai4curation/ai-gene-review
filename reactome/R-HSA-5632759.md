stable_id: R-HSA-5632759
display_name: TP53 binds the SCO2 gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TP53 (p53) binds the p53 response element in the intron 1 of SCO2 (Synthesis
  of Cytochrome c Oxidase 2) gene (Matoba et al. 2006). The binding of TP53 on SCO2
  gene was verified in a genome wide chromatin immunoprecipitation study (Wei et al.
  2006). Tp53 was also found to bind to the promoter region in mouse Sco2 gene to
  stimulate its expression in response to physical exercise (Qi et al. 2011).
