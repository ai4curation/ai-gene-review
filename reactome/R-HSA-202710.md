## Summary

MerTK appears to be required for ingestion of apoptotic cells by professional phagocytes such as monocytes/macrophages, retinal pigment epithelial cells and dendritic cells. Mer appears to be able to induce the cytoskeletal remodelling that is required for engulfment during phagocytosis. For instance, a deletion in the MERTK gene was identified as the underlying cause for retinal dystrophy which involves an impairment in the ingestion of shed photoreceptor cell fragments by retinal pigment epithelial cells. <p>
