display_name: TRAF6 ubiquitinqtes IRF7 within the activated TLR7/8 or 9 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was shown to be essential for IRF7 activation,
  although the role of TRAF6-dependent ubiquitination remains unclear [Kawai T et
  al 2004]. It has been demonstrated that IRF7 is ubiquitinated by TRAF6 at multiple
  sites both in vitro and in vivo[Ning et al 2008].It has been also shown that K63-linked
  ubiquitination of IRF7 is independent of its C-terminal functional phosphorylation
  sites.
