stable_id: R-HSA-9760122
display_name: AcK-NFE2L2-dependent GCLC gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The GCLC gene encodes the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase,
  which produces glutathione from glutamate and cysteine. Glutathione contributes
  to the antioxidant response by reducing peroxides, detoxifying and exporting xenobiotic
  agents and acting as a redox buffer reviewed in Lu, 2013). GCLC expression is regulated
  in part by the binding of acetylated NFE2L2 to the anti-oxidant response element
  (ARE) in its promoter (Sun et al, 2009; Sekhar et al, 2000; McMahon 2001; Thimmulappa
  et al, 2002; reviewed in Lu, 2013).
