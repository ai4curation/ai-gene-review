summary: After NUMB:ITCH-mediated ubiquitination, GLI1 is degraded by the proteasome.  This
  degradation limits the extent and duration of the response to Hh signaling (di Marcotullio

## Summary

After NUMB:ITCH-mediated ubiquitination, GLI1 is degraded by the proteasome.  This degradation limits the extent and duration of the response to Hh signaling (di Marcotullio et al, 2006; Huntzicker et al, 2006; di Marcotullio et al, 2011).
