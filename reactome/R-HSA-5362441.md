display_name: C-terminal Hh fragments are recruited to SEL1:SYVN1 at the ER membrane
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After binding to OS9/ERLEC1, the Hh C-terminal fragments are recruited to
  the ER membrane through a lectin-SEL1 interaction.  SEL1 is a component of a multiprotein
  retrotranslocation complex in the ER membrane that also includes the E3 ubiquitin
  ligase SYVN1 (also known as HRD1; present as a dimer), DERL2 and the hexameric ATPase
  VCP (Christianson et al, 2008; Hosokawa et al, 2008; Mueller et al, 2008; Chen et
  al, 2011; Huang et al, 2013; reviewed in Vembar and Brodsky, 2008). Depletion of
  SEL1, SYVN1, VCP or DERL2 results in the accumulation of the Hh-C in the ER lumen
  (Chen et al, 2011; Huang et al, 2013).
