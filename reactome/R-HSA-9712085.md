display_name: ALK mutants phosphorylate STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: STAT3 is tyrosine phosphorylated at residue 705, and this phosphorylation
  is required for STAT3 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. The
  function of serine 727 phosphorylation is not clear, however it occurs independently
  of tyrosine phosphorylation (reviewed in Yu et al, 2014; Guanizo et al, 2018).

## Summary

STAT3 is tyrosine phosphorylated at residue 705, and this phosphorylation is required for STAT3 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. The function of serine 727 phosphorylation is not clear, however it occurs independently of tyrosine phosphorylation (reviewed in Yu et al, 2014; Guanizo et al, 2018).
