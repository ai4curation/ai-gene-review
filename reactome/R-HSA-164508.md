species: Homo sapiens
summary: The gp41 glycoprotein contains N- and C-terminal heptad repeats, which form
  a stable six-helical bundle.  This six-helix bundle represents a fusion-active gp41
  core, and its conformation is critical for membrane fusion.  Among the interactions
  necessary for the six helix bundle conformation is the formation of a salt bridge
  between the Asp632 residue in the C-terminal heptad repeat and the Lys574 terminal
  in the N-terminal coiled-coil.  Disruption of this interaction has been found to
  lead to destabilization of the six helix bundle formation, with a subsequent severe
  reduction in viral fusion activity.  Also, the N-terminal heptad repeat alone was
  found to be important in viral fusion, as removal or truncation of this repeat reduced
  the fusion activity of the peptide even when the adjacent, full length N-terminal
  fusion peptide was in place.  The bundle itself is formed during the fusion process,
  prior to pore formation but after insertion of the gp41 fusion peptide into the
  target cell membrane.  Upon insertion of the fusion peptide, the three N-terminal
  helices of gp41 adjacent to the target cell membrane and three C-terminal helices
  adjacent to the viral membrane undergo a conformational change which brings them
  into close proximity with one another, creating a six-helix bundle and leading to
  eventual fusion.<br>
