display_name: Activation of RAC1 by VAV
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The organized movements of membranes and the actin cytoskeleton are coordinated
  in phagocytosis by small GTPases of the Rho family. Specifically, RAC1 and CDC42
  are known to be stimulated upon engagement of FCGR and are essential for the extension
  of the pseudopods that surround and engulf the phagocytic particle (Scott et al
  2005). RAC1 is known to regulate actin dynamics. It is active throughout the phagocytic
  cup and activated RAC1 is necessary to assemble F actin. However,  closing the phagocytic
  cup requires RAC1 to be deactivated (Naakaya et al 2007). Deletion of RAC1 prevents
  FCGR mediated phagocytosis (Hall et al 2006). RAC1 activation involves transition
  from an inactive GDP bound to an active GTP bound state catalysed by guanine exchanges
  factors (GEFs). VAV has been implicated in the activation of RAC1 (Patel et al 2002).
