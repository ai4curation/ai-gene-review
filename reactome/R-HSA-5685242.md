stable_id: R-HSA-5685242
display_name: CHEK1 phosphorylates BRCA2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CHEK1 phosphorylates BRCA2 on threonine residue T3887, in the C-terminal
  region of BRCA2. CHEK1-mediated BRCA2 phosphorylation, as well as CHEK1 mediated
  RAD51 phosphorylation, promotes the association of BRCA2 with RAD51 (Bahassi et
  al. 2008).
