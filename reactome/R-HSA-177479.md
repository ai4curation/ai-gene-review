display_name: Axonal transport of NGF:Trk complexes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Of the internalized NGF:TRK complexes, many undergo recycling and/or proteolysis.
  Only a small fraction is retrogradely transported. Vesicles containing neurotrophin,
  activated receptors and downstream kinases are transported through axons by the
  action of dynein, which produces a force towards the end of microtubules.

## Summary

Of the internalized NGF:TRK complexes, many undergo recycling and/or proteolysis. Only a small fraction is retrogradely transported. Vesicles containing neurotrophin, activated receptors and downstream kinases are transported through axons by the action of dynein, which produces a force towards the end of microtubules.
