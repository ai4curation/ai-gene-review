stable_id: R-HSA-6783177
display_name: USP21 deubiquitinates GATA3,IL33
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Though not required for normal development (Pannu et al. 2015), USP21 is
  essential in innate and adaptive immune responses (Tao et al. 2014). It deubiquitinates
  the Th2 specific transcription factor GATA3. This positive regulation is important
  for the function of regulatory T cells (Zhang et al. 2013). USP21 also deubiquitinates
  IL-33, which is both a cytokine and a chromatin-associated nuclear protein known
  as Nuclear factor from high endothelial venule (NF-HEV), which is associated with
  many inflammatory diseases (Garlanda et al. 2013). IL-33 can bind to the RELA (NFkB
  p65) promoter region, inducing endothelial cell activation (Choi et al. 2012). Depletion
  of USP21 reduces IL-33 protein levels and IL-33-mediated RELA promoter activity
  (Tao et al. 2014).
