display_name: CCNE1 gene transcription is stimulated by E2F1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: E2F1 directly stimulates transcription of the CCNE1 gene, encoding cyclin
  E1 (DeGregori et al. 1995, Ohtani et al. 1995).Cyclin E proteins play an important
  role in the transition from G1 to S-phase by associating with CDK2.
