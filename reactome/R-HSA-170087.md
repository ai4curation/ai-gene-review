display_name: CAK phosphorylates CDK1 bound to CCNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Full activity of most CDKs is dependent on CAK mediated phosphorylation at
  a conserved residue (Thr161 in CDK1, also known as Cdc2). This modification is thought
  to improve substrate binding. High affinity binding of Cyclin A within the Cyclin
  A:Cdc2 complex requires this phosphorylation (Desai et al 1995, Merrick et al. 2008).
  CAK is unable to phosphorylate monomeric CDK1 and only phosphorylates it when it
  is bound to cyclin A or cyclin B (Merrick et al. 2008). Using two-dimensional gel
  electrophoresis of protein extracts of cycling human cells, it was shown that CDK1
  phosphorylated at both T14 nad T161 can be co-immunoprecipitated with CCNA2 before
  mitosis (Coulonval et al. 2011).
