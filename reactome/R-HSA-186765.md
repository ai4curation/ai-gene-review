stable_id: R-HSA-186765
display_name: PLC-gamma binds to the active receptor
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PLC-gamma 1 has been shown to bind to phosphorylated Tyr 1021 of the PDGF
  beta-receptor with high affinity and to Tyr 1009 with low affinity. In the alpha-receptor,
  Tyr 988 and Tyr 1018 bind PLC-gamma1. Association of PLC-gamma1 with the activated
  PDGF receptor has been shown to be necessary for its activation.<br>
