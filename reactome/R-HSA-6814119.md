display_name: TRiC/CCT binds unfolded G-protein beta subunit
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex binds nascent, unfolded, G-protein beta subunit
  (GNB1, GNB2, GNB3, GNB4 or GNB5) (Wells et al. 2006). G-beta reaches a near-native
  state in the folding cavity of TRiC, except that TRiC cannot mediate the folding
  of the seven-bladed beta propeller of the G-protein beta to a stable conformation
  (Plimpton et al. 2015).

## Summary

The TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex binds nascent, unfolded, G-protein beta subunit (GNB1, GNB2, GNB3, GNB4 or GNB5) (Wells et al. 2006). G-beta reaches a near-native state in the folding cavity of TRiC, except that TRiC cannot mediate the folding of the seven-bladed beta propeller of the G-protein beta to a stable conformation (Plimpton et al. 2015).
