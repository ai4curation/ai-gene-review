stable_id: R-HSA-5694527
display_name: Loss of SAR1B GTPase
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Sar1p-GTP hydrolysis is increased 15-30-fold by Sec23p. Sar1p-GDP is released
  as a result of this hydrolysis and used in further vesicle sculpting cycles. Sar1p-GTP
  hydrolysis occurs at two critical points during the cycle, first (as represented
  here) as a proofreading step, insuring that the cargo is loaded. Later in the cycle
  Sar1p-GTP hydrolysis triggers the uncoating of the budded vesicle.
