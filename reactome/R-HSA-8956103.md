summary: 'The best characterized CRL2 substrate binding F-box protein is the von Hippel-
  Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, which targets the alpha subunit of hypoxia inducible
  factor (HIFalpha) for ubiquitination and degradation through VCP/p97 and the 26
  S proteasome (Sufan and Ohh, 2006; Heir et al, 2013; reviewed in Cai and Yang, 2016).
  UBXN7 is an adapter that binds to neddylated CUL2 and interferes with the ability
  of the CUL2:EloB:EloC:VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to ubiquitinate HIF alpha,
  in this way causing accumulation of HIF alpha (Bandau et al, 2012; Den Besten et
  al, 2012).

  MUL1 is an E3 ligase located in the outer mitochondrial membrane with its RING domain
  facing the cytosol. MUL1 ubiquitinates the cullin scaffold/adaptor protein UBXN7
  at lysine residues K14 and K412, promoting its 26S proteasome-dependent degradation
  (Cilenti et al, 2020, DiGregorio et al, 2021). By inactivating UBXN7, MUL1 activity
  promotes the CUL2:RBX1-mediated degradation of HIF1 alpha (Di Gregorio et al, 2021).'
