stable_id: R-HSA-937079
display_name: MyD88 oligomerization within the complex of activated TLR:TIRAP:MyD88
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Structural analysis of MyD88:IRAK4 and MyD88:IRAK4:IRAK2 suggested that upon
  MyD88 recruitment to an activated dimerized TLR the MyD88 death domains clustering
  induces the formation of Mydosome, a large oligomeric signaling platform (Motshwene
  PG et al 2009, Lin SC et al 2010). Assembly of  these Myddosome complexes brings
  the kinase domains of IRAKs into proximity for phosphorylation and activation. The
  oligomer complex stoichiometry was reported as 7:4 and 8:4 for MyD88:IRAK4 (Motshwene
  PG et al 2009), and 6:4:4 in the complex of MyD88:IRAK4:IRAK2(Lin SC et al 2010).
