## Summary

CDCA5 (Sororin) is essential for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion at centromeres. Experiments in which a recombinant tagged mouse CDCA5 was expressed in human HeLa cell line showed that CDCA5 starts to accumulate on chromatin in S-phase and dissociates from centromeres in anaphase (Nishiyama et al. 2010).
