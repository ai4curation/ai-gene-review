display_name: TREX complex binds spliced, capped mRNA:CBC:EJC cotranscriptionally
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The THO subcomplex of the TREX complex initially interacts with the serine-2,5
  phosphorylated C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (Strasser et al. 2002, Inferred
  from yeast in Meinel et al. 2013) then with CBP80 of the cap binding complex (Cheng
  et al. 2006, Dufu et al. 2010, Chi et al. 2013). A TREX complex binds spliced mRNA
  near the cap during transcription (Cheng et al. 2006). Recruitment is dependent
  on splicing of the mRNA (Masuda et al. 2005). THO/TREX is required for efficient
  mRNP biogenesis and export (reviewed in Luna et al 2012). In yeast, components of
  the THO/TREX complex also affect transcription and 3' processing of mRNA, (Rondon
  et al. 2003, Rougemaille et al. 2008, Johnson et al. 2011, reviewed in Katahira
  2015), however the human TREX complex does not appear to affect transcription (Masuda
  et al. 2005). The AREX complex, which contains DDX39A (UHR49) rather than DDX39B
  (UAP56) appears to perform the same function as TREX in mRNA export, but acts on
  a different subset of mRNAs (Yamazaki et al. 2010).
