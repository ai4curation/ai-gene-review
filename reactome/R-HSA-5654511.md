stable_id: R-HSA-5654511
display_name: FGFRL1 dimer binds FGFs
species: Homo sapiens
summary: FGFRL1 is a fifth member of the FGFR family of receptors that shares 40%
  sequence similarity with the extracellular region of FGFR1-4, but FGFRL1 lacks the
  internal kinase domain required for typical downstream FGFR signaling. Instead,
  FGFRL1 has a short intracellular domain with a C-terminal histidine rich region
  that has been shown to interact with the MAP kinase regulator SPRED proteins (Sleeman
  et al, 2001; Zhuang et al, 2011; reviewed in Trueb et al, 2013). FGFRL1 forms constitutive
  dimers and has been shown to bind to a wide range of FGF ligands, including FGF3,4,8,10,
  22 and with lower affinity to FGF2,5,17,18 and 23 (Reickman et al, 2008; Steinberg
  et al, 2010). FGFRL1 knockout mice die shortly after birth from lung and renal defects
  (Gerber et al, 2009; Gerber et al, 2012; Trueb et al, 2013). FGFRL1 has been postulated
  to act as a decoy receptor that sequesters ligand away from canonical FGF receptors;
  more recently, however, alternate roles for FGFRL1 in enhancing ERK1/2 activation
  or promoting FGFR1-mediated signaling have been suggested (Sleeman et al, 2001;
  Steinberg et al, 2010; Silva et al, 2013; Amann and Trueb, 2013).  Further work
  will be required to elucidate the role(s) of FGFRL1.
