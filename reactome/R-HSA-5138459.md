stable_id: R-HSA-5138459
display_name: WNT5A:FZD4 is endocytosed
species: Homo sapiens
summary: WNT5A-dependent FZD4 uptake into clathrin-coated vesicles depends upon AP-2
  and possibly ARBB2 (Chen et al, 2003; Yu et al, 2007).  Evidence suggests that ARBB2
  dissociates from the receptor-ligand complex before internalization (Chen et al,
  2003).

## Summary

WNT5A-dependent FZD4 uptake into clathrin-coated vesicles depends upon AP-2 and possibly ARBB2 (Chen et al, 2003; Yu et al, 2007).  Evidence suggests that ARBB2 dissociates from the receptor-ligand complex before internalization (Chen et al, 2003).
