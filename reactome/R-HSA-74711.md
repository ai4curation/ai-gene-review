stable_id: R-HSA-74711
display_name: Phosphorylation of IRS
species: Homo sapiens
summary: At the beginning of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'ATP', and 1 molecule of
  'IRS:activated insulin receptor' are present. At the end of this reaction, 1 molecule
  of 'phospho-IRS:activated insulin receptor', and 1 molecule of 'ADP' are present.<br><br>
  This reaction takes place on the 'internal side of plasma membrane' and  is mediated
  by the 'transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity' of 'IRS:activated
  insulin receptor'.<br>
