display_name: EGFR binds EGF ligand
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The prototypic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) EGFR is composed of 3 major
  domains; an extracellular domain linked via a single membrane-spanning domain to
  a cytoplasmic domain. EGF binds to the extracellular domain from where the signal
  is transmitted to the cytoplasmic domain.
