summary: 'As keratinocytes progress towards the upper epidermis, they undergo a unique
  process of cell death termed cornification (Eckhart et al. 2013). This involves
  the crosslinking of keratinocyte proteins such as loricrin and involucrin by transglutaminases
  and the breakdown of the nucleus and other organelles by intracellular and secreted
  proteases (Eckhart et al. 2000, Denecker et al. 2008). This process is strictly
  regulated by the Ca2+ concentration gradient in the epidermis (Esholtz et al. 2014).
  Loricrin and involucrin are encoded in ‘Epidermal Differentiation Complex’ linked
  to a large number of genes encoding nonredundant components of the CE (Kypriotou
  et al. 2012, Niehues et al. 2016). Keratinocytes produce specialized proteins and
  lipids which are used to construct the cornified envelope (CE), a heavily crosslinked
  submembranous layer that confers rigidity to the upper epidermis, allows keratin
  filaments to attach to any location in the cell membrane (Kirfel et al. 2003) and
  acts as a water-impermeable barrier. The CE has two functional parts: covalently
  cross-linked proteins (10 nm thick) that comprise the backbone of the envelope and
  covalently linked lipids (5 nm thick) that coat the exterior (Eckert et al. 2005).
  Desmosomal components are crosslinked to the CE to form corneodesmosomes, which
  bind cornified cells together (Ishida-Yamamoto et al. 2011). Mature terminally differentiated
  cornified cells consist mostly of keratin filaments covalently attached to the CE
  embedded in lipid lamellae (Kalinin et al. 2002). The exact composition of the cornified
  envelope varies between epithelia (Steinert et al. 1998); the relative amino-acid
  composition of the proteins used may determine differential mechanical properties
  (Kartasova et al. 1996).'

## Summary

As keratinocytes progress towards the upper epidermis, they undergo a unique process of cell death termed cornification (Eckhart et al. 2013).
