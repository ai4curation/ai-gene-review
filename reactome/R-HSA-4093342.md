species: Homo sapiens
summary: Syndecan-2 (SDC2), upon phosphorylation by EPHB2, undergoes multimerization
  and clustering on dendrites leading to spinogenesis. Pathways downstream of SDC2
  that ultimately leads to cytoskeletal rearrangement of the spine have yet to be
  elucidated. Ethell et al. hypothesised that EPHB2 may associate with SDC2 after
  clustering and localise SDC2 to sites of nascent spines. Subsequent recruitment
  of syntenin and CASK by SDC2 via PDZ interactions may promote spinogenesis (Ethell
  et al. 2001, Lin et al. 2007).
