species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Fusions of an N-terminal partner and the cytosolic domain of PDGFRA or PDGFRB
  occur at low frequency in some cancers, particularly haematological disease (Cools
  et al, 2003; Ozawa et al, 2010; Hidalgo-Curtis et al, 2010; reviewed in Wang et
  al, 2016; Appiah-Kubi et al, 2017). Fusion proteins are constitutively active in
  the absence of ligand. Constitutive activation is promoted in many cases by the
  presence of an oligomerization domain in the N-terminal fusion partner, which promotes
  dimerization and subsequent trans-autophosphorylation. This is not always the case,
  however. In the instance of FIP1L1-PDGFRA, for example, constitutive activation
  is independent of the FIP1L1 portion of the protein, and dimerization depends on
  the relief of PDGFRA autoinhibition through disruption of the juxtamembrane region

## Summary

Fusions of an N-terminal partner and the cytosolic domain of PDGFRA or PDGFRB occur at low frequency in some cancers, particularly haematological disease (Cools et al, 2003; Ozawa et al, 2010; Hidalgo-Curtis et al, 2010; reviewed in Wang et al, 2016; Appiah-Kubi et al, 2017). Fusion proteins are constitutively active in the absence of ligand. Constitutive activation is promoted in many cases by the presence of an oligomerization domain in the N-terminal fusion partner, which promotes dimerization and subsequent trans-autophosphorylation. This is not always the case, however. In the instance of FIP1L1-PDGFRA, for example, constitutive activation is independent of the FIP1L1 portion of the protein, and dimerization depends on the relief of PDGFRA autoinhibition through disruption of the juxtamembrane region (Stover et al, 2006; reviewed in Reilly, 2003; Appiah-Kubi et al, 2017).
