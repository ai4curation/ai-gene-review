display_name: Intracellular metabolism of fatty acids regulates insulin secretion
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'Fatty acids augment the glucose triggered secretion of insulin through two
  mechanisms: activation of FFAR1 (GPR40) and intracellular metabolism of fatty acids.
  Fatty acids are transported into the cell by CD36 (FAT) (Noushmehr et al. 2005)
  and metabolized by ligation to coenzyme A (Ansari et al. 2017), transport into mitochondria,
  and beta oxidation which generates ATP. The ATP increases the intracellular ratio
  of ATP:ADP and thereby closes potassium channels (K(ATP) channels) at the plasma
  membrane (reviewed in Acosta-Montano and Garcia-Gonzalez 2018). The enzymes that
  metabolize fatty acids in beta cells also metabolize fatty acids in other tissues
  however their combinations and subcellular locations may differ.'

## Summary

Fatty acids augment the glucose triggered secretion of insulin through two mechanisms: activation of FFAR1 (GPR40) and intracellular metabolism of fatty acids. Fatty acids are transported into the cell by CD36 (FAT) (Noushmehr et al. 2005) and metabolized by ligation to coenzyme A (Ansari et al. 2017), transport into mitochondria, and beta oxidation which generates ATP. The ATP increases the intracellular ratio of ATP:ADP and thereby closes potassium channels (K(ATP) channels) at the plasma membrane (reviewed in Acosta-Montano and Garcia-Gonzalez 2018). The enzymes that metabolize fatty acids in beta cells also metabolize fatty acids in other tissues however their combinations and subcellular locations may differ.
