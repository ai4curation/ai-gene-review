display_name: IL1F10(?-152) binds IL1RAPL1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Interleukins are immunomodulatory proteins that elicit a wide array of responses
  in cells and tissues. Interleukin 1 family member 10 (IL1F10, IL 38) is a member
  of the IL1 family (Lin et al. 2001, Bensen et al. 2001). IL1F10 is selectively produced
  by human apoptotic cells (Mora et al. 2016) and human epidermal keratinocytes (based
  on mRNA studies) (Boutet M A et al. 2016). IL1F10 can bind to interleukin 1 receptor
  like 2 (IL1RL2) and may result in the suppression of IL 17 and IL 22 and induction
  of IL 6 production (van de Veerdonk et al. 2012, Mora et al. 2016). IL1F10 is synthesized
  as precursors that require N terminal processing to attain full receptor agonist
  or antagonist function (Mora et al. 2016). Both full length (1 – 152 amino acids)
  and N terminal truncated (20 – 152 amino acids) IL1F10 can bind Interleukin 1 receptor
  accessory protein like 1 (IL1RAPL1) (Mora et al. 2016). The binding affinity of
  truncated IL1F10 is much higher than that of the full length.  However, binding
  of the full length or truncated forms has distinct outcomes; the former induces
  IL6 and the latter suppresses IL6 via JNK and AP1 signaling (Mora et al. 2016).
