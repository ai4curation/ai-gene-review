stable_id: R-HSA-8855375
display_name: PTPN22 dissociates from CSK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In unstimulated T-lymphocytes, protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN22 (LYP,
  PEP) is associated with CSK, which inhibits the catalytic activity of PTPN22. In
  response to TCR-stimulation, the complex of CSK and PTPN22 dissociates through an
  unknown mechanism, which allows PTPN22 to be recruited to lipid rafts. The PTPN22
  variant PTPN22 R620W, the result of a SNP associated with autoimmune diseases, does
  not bind to CSK and is constitutively active (Vang et al. 2012).
