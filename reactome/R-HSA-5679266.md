display_name: Beclin-1 complex translocates to the ER
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Beclin-1 complex (ATG14:PIK3C3:PIK3R4:BECN1) associates with the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). The ATG14 component of the complex contains an ER-binding motif
  in its N-terminal domain, which appears to be essential for its function in autophagy
  and for the recruitment of the other Beclin-1 complex subunits  to the site of phagophore
  formation (Matsunaga et al. 2010). N-terminal myristoylation of the PIK3R4 (p150)
  component may also anchor the Beclin-1 complex to the membrane (Panaretou et al.
  1997, Wirth et al. 2013).
