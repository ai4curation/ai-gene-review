display_name: NAGLU hydrolyses Heparan sulfate chain(4)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) hydrolyses the non-reducing, terminal
  N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue from heparan sulfate. The active form of the enzyme
  (77kDa) is derived from a 82kDa precursor (Weber et al. 1996). Defects in NAGLU
  cause of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPSIIIB, MIM:252920) also known as Sanfilippo
  syndrome type B (Beesley et al. 2005).
