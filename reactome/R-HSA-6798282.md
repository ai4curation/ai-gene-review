stable_id: R-HSA-6798282
display_name: TP53 and E2F4 bind the CDC25C gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The promoter of the CDC25C gene contains p53 response elements as well as
  E2F binding sites and can bind both TP53 (St Clair et al. 2004) and E2F4 (Benson
  et al. 2014). E2F4 transcription repressor complex consists of E2F4, a transcriptional
  co-factor TFDP1 (DP1) or TFDP2 (DP2), and a retinoblastoma family protein RBL1 (p107)
  or RBL2 (p130). The CDK inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A), induced by TP53, positively affects
  E2F4 recruitment to the CDC25C promoter, probably by upregulating RBL2 (Helmbold
  et al. 2009, Benson et al. 2014).
