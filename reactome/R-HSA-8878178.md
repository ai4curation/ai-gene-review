display_name: The complex of RUNX3, SMAD3 and SMAD4 binds the CDKN1A gene promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The CDKN1A (p21) gene promoter contains five putative RUNX3 binding sites.
  RUNX3 binds the CDKN1A promoter. The complex of SMAD4 and activated SMAD3, a known
  CDKN1A transcriptional activator, can bind to RUNX3 to cooperatively activate the
  CDKN1A gene transcription (Chi et al. 2005).
