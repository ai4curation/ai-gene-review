stable_id: R-HSA-1248002
display_name: Ligand-independent dimerization of EGFRvIII mutant
species: Homo sapiens
summary: EGFRvIII mutant lacks the ligand binding domain and is therefore unable to
  bind EGFR ligands, but is able to dimerize spontaneously. Self-dimerization may
  be dependent on N-linked glycosylation.

## Summary

EGFRvIII mutant lacks the ligand binding domain and is therefore unable to bind EGFR ligands, but is able to dimerize spontaneously. Self-dimerization may be dependent on N-linked glycosylation.
