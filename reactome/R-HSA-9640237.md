display_name: CASTOR1 in CASTOR1:CASTOR2 binds L-arginine and dissociates from GATOR2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CASTOR1 in a heterodimer with CASTOR2 interacts with the GATOR2 complex via
  the MIOS subunit of GATOR2 (Chantranupong et al. 2016, Gai et al. 2016). The ACT
  domains of the CASTOR1 subunit bind L-arginine (Chantranupong et al. 2016, Saxton
  et al. 2016, Xia et al. 2016, Gai et al. 2016) and CASTOR1:arginine dissociates
  from GATOR2, which then prevents GATOR1 from activating the GTPase of RRAGA,B (Chantranupong
  et al. 2016). GATOR1 is recruited to the lysosomal membrane by the KICSTOR complex
  (Wolfson et al. 2017).

## Summary

CASTOR1 in a heterodimer with CASTOR2 interacts with the GATOR2 complex via the MIOS subunit of GATOR2 (Chantranupong et al. 2016, Gai et al. 2016). The ACT domains of the CASTOR1 subunit bind L-arginine (Chantranupong et al. 2016, Saxton et al. 2016, Xia et al. 2016, Gai et al. 2016) and CASTOR1:arginine dissociates from GATOR2, which then prevents GATOR1 from activating the GTPase of RRAGA,B (Chantranupong et al. 2016).
