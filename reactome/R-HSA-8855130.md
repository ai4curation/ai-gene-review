species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to very
  low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), the resultant complex is internalised
  via the canonical clathrin-dependent endocytic machinery. This degradation route
  that does not require ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor and
  does not involve proteasomal or autophagy pathways. The PCSK9:VLDLR:Clathrin-coated
  vesicle complex translocates from the plasma membrane, via endosomes to the lysosomal
  membrane where the receptor is degraded (Zhang et al. 2007, Poirier et al. 2008).

## Summary

This degradation route that does not require ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor and does not involve proteasomal or autophagy pathways. The PCSK9:VLDLR:Clathrin-coated vesicle complex translocates from the plasma membrane, via endosomes to the lysosomal membrane where the receptor is degraded (Zhang et al. 2007, Poirier et al. 2008).
