display_name: Ferritin Complex oxidises 4Fe2+ to Fe(3+)O(OH)
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Ferritin oxidises Fe(2+) ions to Fe(3+), migrates them to its centre, and
  collects thousands of them as ferric hydroxide (Fe(3+)O(OH)) in the central mineral
  core from which they can be later remobilised  (Harrison & Arrosio 1996).
