stable_id: R-HSA-9724099
display_name: ALK mutants:p-3Y SHC binds GRB2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: GRB2 is found in complex with SHC in cells expressing a number of ALK fusion
  proteins and may contribute to signaling through the MAP kinase and PI3K pathways.
  In some backgrounds, GRB2 may also bind directly to the fusion protein itself to
  promote signaling (Fukimoto et al, 1996; Hernandez et al, 2002; Trinei et al, 2000;
  reviewed in Hallberg and Palmer, 2013; Hallberg and Palmer, 2016; Roskoski, 2013).
