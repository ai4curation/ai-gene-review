species: Homo sapiens
summary: The remaining flap, which is too short to support RPA binding, is then processed
  by FEN-1. There is evidence that binding of RPA to the displaced end of the RNA-containing
  Okazaki fragment prevents FEN-1 from accessing the substrate.  FEN-1 is a structure-specific
  endonuclease that cleaves near the base of the flap at a position one nucleotide
  into the annealed region. Biochemical studies have shown that the preferred substrate
  for FEN-1 consists of a one-nucleotide 3'-tail on the upstream primer in addition
  to the 5'-flap of the downstream primer.
