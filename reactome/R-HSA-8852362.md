display_name: GTSE1 binds CDKN1A
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Stabilization of the newly synthesized protein product of the CDKN1A (p21)
  gene, a CDK inhibitor and a TP53 (p53) transcriptional target, requires binding
  of CDKN1A to FKBPL (WISp39). FKBPL simultaneously interacts with CDKN1A and a chaperone
  protein HSP90, forming a ternary complex (Jascur et al. 2005). GTSE1 was identified
  as another component of the complex of CDKN1A, FKBPL and HSP90. GTSE1 directly interacts
  with CDKN1A and FKBPL and contributes to CDKN1A stabilization (Bublik et al. 2010).
  Increased CDKN1A levels delay G2/M onset and rescue cells from G2 checkpoint-induced
  apoptosis, thus causing resistance to taxol induced cytotoxicity (Yu et al. 1998,
  Bublik et al. 2010).

## Summary

Stabilization of the newly synthesized protein product of the CDKN1A (p21) gene, a CDK inhibitor and a TP53 (p53) transcriptional target, requires binding of CDKN1A to FKBPL (WISp39). FKBPL simultaneously interacts with CDKN1A and a chaperone protein HSP90, forming a ternary complex (Jascur et al. 2005). GTSE1 was identified as another component of the complex of CDKN1A, FKBPL and HSP90. GTSE1 directly interacts with CDKN1A and FKBPL and contributes to CDKN1A stabilization (Bublik et al. 2010). Increased CDKN1A levels delay G2/M onset and rescue cells from G2 checkpoint-induced apoptosis, thus causing resistance to taxol induced cytotoxicity (Yu et al. 1998, Bublik et al. 2010).
