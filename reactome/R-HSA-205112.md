summary: Neurotrophin or proneurotrophin signalling promotes p75NTR cleavage by gamma-secretase,
  allowing the release of p75 ICD and NRIF. This mechanism was shown in sympathetic
  neurons.<br>Gamma-secretase can be activated in a number of ways, including  signalling
  via p75NTR. The phorbol esther PMA induces p75 cleavage, followed by NRIF nuclear
  translocation, after 30 min. Neurotrophin binding to p75, instead, triggers the
  same events only after 12 h.
