display_name: RAB1:GTP recruits GBF1 to the ERGIC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In its GTP-bound active state, RAB1 recruits the ARF GEF GBF1 to the ERGIC
  (Monetta et al, 2007). GBF1 is the only ARF activator required for the formation
  of COPI coats, and it therefore has roles in the anterograde ERGIC-to-cis-Golgi
  pathway as well as in COPI-mediated retrograde transport within the Golgi and back
  to the ERGIC and ER (Kawamoto et al, 2002; Szul et al, 2005; Zhao et al, 2006; Szul
  et al, 2007; reviewed in Szul and Sztul, 2011).  GBF1 activates ARF4 which is concentrated
  at the ERGIC compartment, but also ARF1 and ARF5 which have more generalized localization
  within the secretory pathway (Volpicelli-Daley et al, 2005; Chun et al, 2008; reviewed
  in D'Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006). GBF1 also interacts with the USO1 homodimer,
  a long coiled-coil tethering factor (Garcia-Mata and Sztul, 2003).

## Summary

In its GTP-bound active state, RAB1 recruits the ARF GEF GBF1 to the ERGIC (Monetta et al, 2007). GBF1 is the only ARF activator required for the formation of COPI coats, and it therefore has roles in the anterograde ERGIC-to-cis-Golgi pathway as well as in COPI-mediated retrograde transport within the Golgi and back to the ERGIC and ER (Kawamoto et al, 2002; Szul et al, 2005; Zhao et al, 2006; Szul et al, 2007; reviewed in Szul and Sztul, 2011).
