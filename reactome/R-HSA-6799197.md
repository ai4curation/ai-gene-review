stable_id: R-HSA-6799197
display_name: ND4, ND5 bind the 550kDa complex to form the 815kDa complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Distal components of the membrane arm MT-ND4 and 5 associate with the 550kDa
  complex to form the 815kDa complex (Mckenzie & Ryan 2010, Andrews et al. 2013).
  Distal membrane-arm assembly complex proteins 1 and 2 (DMAC1, DMAC2) are required
  for the integration of ND4 and ND5. Knockout of DMAC1 or DMAC2 led to severe Complex
  I deficiency in HEK293T cells (Stroud et al., 2016).
