display_name: PSMD5 and PSMD2 bind PSMC2:PSMC1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The subcomplex of the base of the proteasome 19S regulatory particle (19S
  RP), the PSMC2:PSMC1 dimer (orthologous to the yeast Rpt1:Rpt2 dimer) binds the
  chaperone proteins PSMD5 (orthologous to yeast Hsm3, also known as S5b) and PSMD2
  (orthologous to yeast Rpn1) (reviewed in Tomko and Hochstrasser 2013). Formation
  of the heterotetramer between endogenous human proteins PSMC2 (Rpt1), PSMC1 (Rpt2),
  PSMD5 (Hsm3/S5b) and PSMD2 (Rpn1) was demonstrated in human embryonic kidney cell
  line HEK293T (Kaneko et al. 2009). Using recombinant human proteins, it was shown
  that PSMD5 directly interacts with PSMC2 while PSMD2 directly interacts with PSMC1
  (Kaneko et al. 2009). Knockdown of either PSMC1, PSMC2, or PSMD2 reduces the protein
  levels of all of the subunits of the PSMD5:PSMC2:PSMC1:PSMD2 heterotetramer, except
  that knockdown of PSMC1 or PSMC2 only modestly affects PSMD2 levels (Kaneko et al.
  2009). Knockdown of PSMD5 does not significantly affect the levels of PSMC1, PSMC2,
  or PSMD2 (Kaneko et al. 2009). Interactions of human PSMD2, PSMC1, and PSMC2 with
  each other and the surrounding proteins in different 19S RP conformations were structurally
  characterized by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (Lu et al. 2017).
