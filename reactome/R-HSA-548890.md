display_name: Removal of the third glucose by glucosidase II and release from the
  chaperone
species: Homo sapiens
summary: While the protein is bound to the chaperone complex, the glycan is still
  accessible to glucosidase II, which eventually removes the last remaining glucose
  residue. This also results in breaking the interaction between the chaperone and
  the glycoprotein, independently of whether the latter has achieved proper folding
  (Pelletier MF et al, 2000). This has been interpreted as a 'timing mechanism', in
  which a protein has only a limited period of time to achieve correct folding when
  bound to the chaperone, to avoid the scenario where proteins that take too long
  to fold would block the availability of CNX or CRT. Proteins with folding defects
  get transported to the Endoplasmic Reticulum Quality Control Compartment, while
  proteins with correct folding are transported to the cis-Golgi where the glycan
  is further modified.
