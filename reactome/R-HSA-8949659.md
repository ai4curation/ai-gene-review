stable_id: R-HSA-8949659
display_name: AFG3L2 (m-AAA protease) degrades SMDT1 that is not assembled in MCU
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Free SMDT1 (EMRE) that is not complexed with MICU1 and MICU2 (or MICU3) is
  degraded by AFG3L2 (m-AAA protease) (Konig et al. 2016). This degradation appears
  to prevent the formation of MCU complexes that contain MCU and SMDT1 but lack MICU1
  and MICU2 (or MICU3) and are therefore unregulated.
