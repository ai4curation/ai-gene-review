display_name: CFTR F508del binds components of the ERAD machinery for ubiquitination
  and degradation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Deletion of phenylalanine 508 in CFTR is the most prevalent mutation causing
  cystic fibrosis (Riordan et al, 1989; Kerem et al, 1989).  F508 deletion causes
  destabilization and subsequent targeting for co-translational degradation by the
  ER-associated degradation machinery (ERAD).  Like misfolded WT CFTR protein, F508del
  is ubiquitinated by ERAD-associated E3 ligases including RNF5 and RNF 185, targeting
  it for VCP-mediated retrotranslocation and 26S proteasomal degradation (Meachem
  et al, 2001; Rosser et al, 2008; Younger et al, 2004; Younger et al, 2006; El Khouri
  et al, 2013; reviewed in Pranke and Sermet-Gaudelus, 2014).
