display_name: POLZ elongates POLI-incorporated dNMP
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After it incorporates a dNMP opposite to a damaged template base, DNA polymerase
  iota (POLI) is unable to efficiently elongate the DNA strand further. The elongation
  step is performed by the DNA polymerase zeta complex (POLZ), composed of REV3L and
  MAD2L2 subunits (Johnson et al. 2000). POLK has also been implicated in the elongation
  step (Washington et al. 2004).
