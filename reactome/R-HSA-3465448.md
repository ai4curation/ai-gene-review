display_name: Caspase-8 and FLIP(L) processing at DISC
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the presence of FLIP(L), both caspase-8 and FLIP(L) are recruited and
  partially processed at the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). The partially
  processed proteins stay bound to the DISC.<p>The long cellular FLIP (FLIP(L) or
  c-FLIPL) has two death effector domains (DED) and a caspase-like domain that lacks
  catalytic activity due to absence of a cysteine residue. Processing of FLIP(L) occurs
  at the DISC and depends on caspase-8 activity (zymogen and mature form). Upon activation
  FLIP(L) is cleaved to generate N-terminal FLIP(p43) and C-terminal FLIP(p12)(Irmler
  M et al. 1997; Jong WY et al. 2009). Processed FLIP(L) can enhance the proteolytic
  activity of procaspase-8 (Chang DW et al. 2002; Jong WY et al. 2009; Pop C et al.
  2011). However, the increased FLIP(L) protein levels in cells have been found to
  limit caspase-8 activity and inhibit apoptotic signaling pathway,
