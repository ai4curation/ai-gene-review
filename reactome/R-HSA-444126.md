stable_id: R-HSA-444126
display_name: HUT2 and HUT11 mediate urea transport in kidney and erythrocytes respectively
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Carrier-mediated urea transport allows rapid urea movement across the cell
  membrane, which is particularly important in the process of urinary concentration
  and for rapid urea equilibrium in non-renal tissues. Two carriers exist in humans,
  HUT2 which is renal-specific (Olives B et al, 1996) and HUT11, which is erythrocyte-specific
  (Olives B et al, 1994).

## Summary

Carrier-mediated urea transport allows rapid urea movement across the cell membrane, which is particularly important in the process of urinary concentration and for rapid urea equilibrium in non-renal tissues. Two carriers exist in humans, HUT2 which is renal-specific (Olives B et al, 1996) and HUT11, which is erythrocyte-specific (Olives B et al, 1994).
