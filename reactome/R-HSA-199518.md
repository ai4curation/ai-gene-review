species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'CD19 is a lymphocyte cell surface molecule that functions as a general response
  regulator or rheostat, which defnes signalling thresholds. These responses are infuenced
  by signals transduced through a CD19-CD21 cell surface receptor complex, where the
  binding of complement C3d to CD21 links humoral immune responses with the innate
  immune system. The CD19-CD21 complex is composed of at least four non-covalently
  associated proteins: CD19, CD21(complement receptor 2),CD81 and CD225.'
