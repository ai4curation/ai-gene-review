display_name: IL10 gene produces IL10 protein
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The Interleukin 10 (IL10) gene is located at chromosome 1q31-32. It encodes
  for a protein with the same name that acts as a pleiotropic cytokine expressed primarily
  by monocytes and to a smaller degree by lymphocytes. IL10 down-regulates the expression
  of Th1 cytokines, MHC class II and costimulatory molecules on macrophages (Eskdale
  et al. 1997).
