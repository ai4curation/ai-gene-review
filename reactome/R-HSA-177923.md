stable_id: R-HSA-177923
display_name: Sustained activation of SRC kinase by SHP2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SHP2 can dephosphorylate paxillin, which leads to CSK dissociation from the
  paxillin-SRC complex and SRC activation. SRC is an SHP2 effector in EGF-stimulated
  ERK activation and cell migration.
