stable_id: R-HSA-3928592
display_name: p190RhoGEF exchanges GTP for GDP on RHOA, activating it
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Receptor stimulation induces translocation of RHOA from the cytosol to the
  plasma membrane and subsequent activation of RHOA. Rho guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor 28 (p190RhoGEF, ARHGEF28) is a specific activator of RHOA that stimulates
  the exchange of GDP for GTP. In neuronal cells p190RhoGEF binds to and activates
  RHOA with its Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology domain (van Horck et al. 2001).
