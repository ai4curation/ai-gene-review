display_name: Formation of the Spliceosomal Pre-B complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex loosely binds the Spliceosomal A complex to
  form the Spliceosomal Pre-B complex (Boesler et al. 2016). The U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP
  comprises the U4 snRNA base-paired with the U6 snRNA within U4/U6 di-snRNP, the
  U5 snRNP and tri-snRNP specific factors. The 3' end of the U2 snRNA is bound to
  the branch point sequence which leaves the 5' end of the U2 snRNA free to base-pair
  with the 3' end of the U6 from the tri-snRNP (Hausner et al. 1990, Boesler et al.
  2016). In addition, the SF3A1 component of the U2 snRNP binds the U4/U6 region of
  tri-snRNP (Charenton et al. 2019). U1 snRNP, bound to the 5’splice site transiently
  interacts with tri-snRNP proximal to the DDX23 helicase and U6 and U5 acceptor sequences.
  The PRPF4B kinase involved B complex formation via phosphorylation of tri-snRNP
  components, is loosely bound to the pre-B complex. The components of the Spliceosomal
  Pre-B complex have been ascertained using proteomic and structural methods (Boesler
  et al. 2016, Zhan et al. 2018, Charenton et al. 2019)..
