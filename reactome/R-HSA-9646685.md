display_name: Aggresome dissociates from dynein and microtubule
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Misfolded proteins are transformed into aggresomes at the microtubule organizing
  center. Dynein motor proteins facilitate the transport of misfolded proteins along
  the microtubule. Subsequently, the system disassembles to release the aggresome.
  The aggresome then recruits chaperone to be degraded by the autophagy machinery
  (Garcia Mata R et al. 1999).

## Summary

Misfolded proteins are transformed into aggresomes at the microtubule organizing center. Dynein motor proteins facilitate the transport of misfolded proteins along the microtubule. Subsequently, the system disassembles to release the aggresome. The aggresome then recruits chaperone to be degraded by the autophagy machinery (Garcia Mata R et al. 1999).
