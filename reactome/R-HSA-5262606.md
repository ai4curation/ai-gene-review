stable_id: R-HSA-5262606
display_name: XAV939 binds tankyrase to stabilize axin and inhibit WNT signaling
species: Homo sapiens
summary: XAV939 binds to the catalytic sites of tankyrase 1 and 2 and inhibits the
  ADP-ribosylation of AXIN1 and 2. Treatment of cells with XAV939 significantly increases
  the protein, but not the mRNA levels of AXIN1 and 2 and supports a strong increase
  in the level of GSK3beta-AXIN complexes.  These cells also show increased phosphorylation
  of beta-catenin, decreased beta-catenin protein levels and a corresponding decrease
  in beta-catenin dependent transcription.  Treatment of DLD-1 cells with XAV939 has
  also been shown to inhibit proliferation (Huang et al, 2009).  XAV939 has not been
  tested in a clinical setting.
