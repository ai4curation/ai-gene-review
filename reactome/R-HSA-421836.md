display_name: trans-Golgi Network Derived Vesicle Uncoating
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The heat shock protein Hsc70 and auxilin, a J-domain containing protein,
  are responsible for clathrin disassembly through an ATP-dependent reaction. This
  uncoating step may be a point in the pathway subject to regulation. This final step
  releases the vesicle from the clathrin cage. The vesicle still contatins a specific
  Vamp molecule, part of the targeting and fusion mechanism that delivers the vesicle
  to its ultimate destination. This vesicle also contains its cargo, membrane proteins
  embeded in the Golgi-associated vesicle membrane.
