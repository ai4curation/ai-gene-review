species: Homo sapiens
summary: Vertebrate SUFU plays a critical role in the negative regulation of Hh signaling
  in the absence of ligand.  Disruption of SUFU causes constitutive activation of
  the pathway, and is associated with the development of medulloblastoma in humans
  (Cooper et al, 2005; Svard et al, 2006; Taylor et al, 2002; Pastorino et al, 2009).  SUFU
  binds directly to all three GLI proteins (Pearse et al, 1999; Stone et al, 1999;
  Jia et al, 2009; Svard et al, 2006).  Formation of a SUFU:GLI complex is required
  for the processing of GLI3 to the GLI3R repressor form, and the processing depends
  on transit through the primary cilia (Kise et al, 2009; Humke et al, 2010; Huangfu
  and Anderson, 2005). Despite this, primary cilia are not required for SUFU to inhibit
  GLI activity; SUFU may also serve in a cilia-independent manner to sequester the
  full-length protein in the cytoplasm in the absence of Hh signal (Chen et al, 2009;
  Humke et al, 2010; Jia et al, 2009; Tukachinsky et al, 2010). After processing,
  GLI3R dissociates from SUFU and its activity is SUFU-independent (Humke et al, 2010;
  Tukachinsky et al, 2010).  Nuclear SUFU may also play a direct role as a transcriptional
  co-repressor through interaction with the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of GLI proteins,
  though this remains to be fully elaborated (Monnier et al, 1998; Pearse et al, 1999;
  Cheng and Bishop, 2002; Paces-Fessy et al, 2004; Dunaeva et al, 2003; Szczepny et
  al, 2014).
