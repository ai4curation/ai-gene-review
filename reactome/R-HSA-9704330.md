display_name: Defective D-loop formation mediated by PALB2, BRCA2 and RAD51 due to
  loss-of-function of PALB2 in BRCA1 binding
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The coiled-coil domain at the N-terminus of PALB2 represents a hotspot for
  mutations in <i>PALB2</i>. Several <i>PALB2</i> missense mutants have been characterized
  either in targeted studies (Sy et al. 2009, Foo et al. 2017, Song et al. 2018) or
  as part of high throughput approaches to characterize clinical variants of uncertain
  significance (reviewed in Boonen et al. 2020).<br><br>The following PALB2 missense
  mutants have been shown to be at least partially defective in their ability to bind
  to BRCA1 (some of these mutants were also shown to be defective in their ability
  to homodimerize and to promote homologous recombination repair (HRR); in addition,
  some have been shown to confer sensitivity to DNA damaging agents or to PARP inhibitors):<br>PALB2
  L21A (originally studied as a synthetic mutant with an amino acid substitution at
  one of the coiled-coil domain residues of PALB2 that are critical for BRCA1 binding
  and homodimerization (Sy et al. 2009, Song et al. 2018); this mutant has also been
  reported clinically, in Clingen Allele Registry (Pawliczek et al. 2018), as a consequence
  of an in-frame indel in <i>PALB2</i>)<br>PALB2 L24S (Boonen et al. 2019; Wiltshire
  et al. 2020; also shown to be defective in HRR (Boonen et al. 2019, Wiltshire et
  al. 2020), confer sensitivity to cisplatin (Wiltshire et al. 2020) and PARP inhibitor
  olaparib (Wiltshire et al. 2020))<br>PALB2 Y28C (partially impaired in BRCA1 binding,
  Foo et al. 2017; significantly impaired BRCA1 binding, Rodrigue et al. 2019; does
  not disrupt PALB2 self-interaction (Foo et al. 2017); not significantly defective
  in HRR and does not confer sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and PARP inhibitors
  (Foo et al. 2017); partially defective in HRR (Rodrigue et al. 2019, Wiltshire et
  al. 2020) and significantly sensitive to cisplatin and PARP inhibition (Boonen et
  al. 2019))<br>PALB2 L35P (Foo et al. 2017, Rodrigue et al. 2019, Boonen et al. 2019,

  also shown to be defective in HRR (Foo et al. 2017, Rodrigue et al. 2019, Boonen
  et al. 2019, Wiltshire et al. 2020), confer sensitivity to platinum salts (Foo et

  Rodrigue et al. 2019, Boonen et al. 2019, Wiltshire et al. 2020))<br><br>Interestingly,
  some of the PALB2 variants that show a defective interaction with BRCA1, such as
  PALB2 L24S, PALB2 Y28C, and PALB2 L35P, seem to have slightly elevated protein levels
  (Foo et al. 2017, Boonen et al. 2019, Wiltshire et al. 2020).<br><br>Synthetic PALB2
