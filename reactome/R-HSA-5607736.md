display_name: MALT1 oligomerizes
species: Homo sapiens
summary: After binding BCL10, MALT1 also undergoes oligomerization. Like traditional
  caspases, MALT1 also becomes activated through the formation of oligomers. Once
  the CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome is assembled, MALT1 functions as the effector
  protein and mediates activation of the IKK complex (McAllister-Lucas & Lucas 2008).
