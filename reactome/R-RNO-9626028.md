stable_id: R-RNO-9626028
display_name: Hspa8:Substrate dissociates from Lamp2 multimer
species: Rattus norvegicus
summary: Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) translocates substrates from the
  cytosol to the lysosomal membrane where it binds to Lysosome-associated membrane
  glycoprotein 2 (Lamp2a). The Lamp2a complex then multimerizes and stabilizes. Subsequently,
  the substrate unfolds and translocates to the lumen. The substrate bound Hspa8 then
  dissociates from Lamp2a multimer (Agarraberes FA et al. 1997, Cuervo AM et al. 1997).
  The function of Lamp2a multimer is now complete and starts to disassemble.
