stable_id: R-HSA-202724
display_name: P-selectin binds P-selectin ligand
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PSGL-1 is expressed as a homodimer of two 120-kDa subunits that binds all
  four selectins, with the highest affinity for P-selectin, and is known to be constitutively
  expressed on the surface of platelets and most types of leukocytes. Besides playing
  a critical role in the inflammatory response by mediating leukocyte-leukocyte and
  leukocyte-endothelium interactions, PSGL-1 also participates in the hemostatic process
  by mediating leukocyte-platelet interactions.
