## Summary

The presence of an exon junction complex (EJC) downstream of a termination codon enhances nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) but is not absolutely required for NMD. The EJC is deposited during splicing and remains bound to the mRNA until a ribosome dislodges it during the pioneer round of translation, distinguished by the presence of the cap-binding complex at the 5' end. If translation terminates at least 50-55 nucleotides 5' to an EJC during the pioneer round then termination factors (eRF1 and eRF3) and the EJC recruit UPF1 and other NMD machinery (Lykke-Andersen et al. 2001, Ishigaki et al. 2001,  Le Hir et al. 2001, Gehring et al. 2003, Hosoda et al. 2005, Kashima et al. 2006, Singh et al. 2007, Chamieh et al. 2008, Ivanov et al. 2008, Buchwald et al. 2010).<br>A current model for NMD enhanced by the EJC posits recruitment of UPF1, SMG1, SMG8, and SMG9 to eRF3 at the ribosome to form the SURF complex (Kashima et al. 2006, Chang et al. 2007, Isken et al. 2008, Muhlemann et al. 2008, Stalder and Muhlemann 2008, Chamieh et al. 2009, Maquat and Gong 2009, Rebbapragada and Lykke-Andersen 2009, Hwang et al. 2010, Nicholson et al. 2010).
