display_name: RUNX1 and GATA1 bind the promoter of the MIR27A gene
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The RUNX1:CBFB complex can bind to the promoter of the MIR27A gene, encoding
  microRNA miR-27A (Ben-Ami et al. 2009). Based on analogy with the ITGA2B gene transcription
  (Zhao et al. 2008), the PRMT1-mediated arginine-methylation increases transcriptional
  activity of the RUNX1:CBFB complex at the MIR27A gene promoter (Herglotz et al.
  2013). In addition to the RUNX1:CBFB complex, the complex of GATA1 and ZFPM1 (FOG1)
  (Freson et al. 2003) is also recruited to the MIR27A promoter (Herglotz et al. 2013),
  likely through the interaction between GATA1 and RUNX1 (Elagib et al. 2003). The
  zinc finger domain of GATA1 is involved in binding to RUNX1 (Xu et al. 2006). Along
  with RUNX1 and GATA1, histone acetyltransferases p300 (EP300) and PCAF (KAT2B),
  as well as the WDR5-containing histone methyltransferase MLL complex are also recruited
  to the MIR27A promoter. Dimethylation of histone H3 on lysine residue K4 (K5 when
  taking into account the initiator methionine), known as the H3K4me2 mark, is characteristic
  of nucleosomes associated with megakaryocyte specific promoters, including the MIR27A
  gene, prior to the onset of differentiation (Herglotz et al. 2013).
