display_name: ATF4, CEBPB, and ATF3 bind the CHAC1 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: ATF4 binds the ATF/CRE element and the ACM elements in the promoter of the
  CHAC1 gene. ATF3 and CEBPB bind the ATF/CRE element (Crawford et al. 2015). The
  stoichiometry and interaction between the transcription factors at the promoter
  is unknown.
