display_name: MIR34 microRNAs bind 3'UTR of NOTCH1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Translation of NOTCH1 mRNA is inhibited by MIR34 microRNAs (MIR34A, MIR34B
  and MIR34C), which bind to the 3'UTR of NOTCH1 mRNA. Expression of MIR34 microRNAs
  is directly regulated by the p53 (TP53) tumor suppressor gene (Chang et al. 2007,
  Raver-Shapira et al. 2007), and MIR34-mediated downregulation of NOTCH1 signaling
  is thought to negatively regulate cell survival, motility and maintenance of an
  undifferentiated state.
