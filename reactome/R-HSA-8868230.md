summary: Actin polymerization is not absolutely required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis,
  and disruption of actin does not interfere with the early stages of clathrin-coated
  pit formation. Actin is required to complete vesicle formation under conditions
  of high membrane tension, such as on the apical side of polarized epithelial cell,
  while actin is dispensable for this process in the absence of membrane tension (Boulant
  et al, 2011). In cases where actin is required, it appears to be recruited late
  to the emerging clathrin-coated pit, just prior to or coincident with the recruitment
  of dynamin and vesicle scission (Taylor et al, 2011; Taylor et al, 2012; reviewed
  in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011).  Recruitment of actin depends on the ARP2/3 complex,
  and cortactin or the neural Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome proteins WASL. These proteins,
  in turn, are recruited through interactions with N-BAR domain containing proteins
  such as SNX9 (Yarar et al, 2007; Shin et al, 2007; Shin et al, 2008; Ferguson et
  al, 2009; reviewed in Lundmark and Carlsson, 2009; McMahon and Boucrot, 2011).<br>HIP1
  and HIP1R are additional components of the late clathrin-coated pit that interact
  with clathrin and AP-2 and may contribute to actin nucleation (Waelter et al, 2001;

## Summary

Actin polymerization is not absolutely required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and disruption of actin does not interfere with the early stages of clathrin-coated pit formation. Actin is required to complete vesicle formation under conditions of high membrane tension, such as on the apical side of polarized epithelial cell, while actin is dispensable for this process in the absence of membrane tension (Boulant et al, 2011).
