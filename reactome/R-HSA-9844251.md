display_name: GP1BA variant binds to VWF multimer:collagen
species: Homo sapiens
summary: This Reactome event describes gain-of-function variants of glycoprotein Ib
  α GPIbα (encoded by GP1BA) that cause macrothrombocytopenia and mucocutaneous bleeding
  in patients with platelet-type von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD) due to enhanced affinity
  for von Willebrand factor (VWF) (Miller JL et al., 1991; Russell SD & Roth GJ 1993;
  Matsubara Y et al., 2003; Enayat S et al., 2012; Woods AI et al., 2014; Blenner
  MA et al., 2014; Bury L et al., 2022).<p>Circulating VWF binds to exposed vascular
  collagen at sites of vascular injury (Colace TV & Diamond SL 2013). Upon binding
  to collagen, VWF becomes anchored to the damaged surface. Shear forces then induce
  conformational changes to mechanosensitive VWF causing the bound VWF to stretch
  and unfold (Li F et al., 2004; Schneider SW et al., 2007; Fu H et al., 2017). VWF
  unfolding leads to exposure of the A1 domain to allow binding to GP1BA, a subunit
  of the platelet surface GP1B:IX:V complex (also known as GPIb complex) (Dumas JJ
  et al., 2004; Ju L et al., 2013). Genetic mutations in VWF or platelet glycoproteins
  such as GP1BA can compromise hemostatic processes such as platelet adhesion, activation
  and aggregation. <p>Caplacizumab (CABLIVI®, also known as ALX-0081), is a bivalent
  humanized antibody fragment consisting of a single variable domain that binds the
  A1 domain of VWF with high affinity (Lee HT et al., 2021). Caplacizumab inhibits
  binding between VWF and GPIbα.
