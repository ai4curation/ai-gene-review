display_name: IL20:IL20RA:JAK1:IL20RB:p-JAK3,p-JAK2:STAT3 phosphorylates STAT3
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A and 5B (STAT5A, STAT5B)
  is phosphorylated after binding the Interleukin-20 (IL20) receptor complex, which
  consist of IL20, Interleukin-20 receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA), phosphorylated
  Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1), Interleukin-20 receptor subunit beta (IL20RB),
  phosphorylated Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2 (JAK2), Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK3
  (JAK3) and STAT5. After IL20 stimulation STAT5 is phosphorylated at Tyr-694 (Tritsaris
  et al. 2007). It is not clear which kinase subunit of the receptor complex is responsible
  for STAT5 phosphorylation.
