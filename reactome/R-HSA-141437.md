species: Homo sapiens
summary: Upon release from the kinetochore, Mad2 associates with Cdc20, hBUBR1, and
  hBUB3 to form the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC). Assembly of this complex does
  not depend on kinetochores but this complex can only inhibit APC/C that has undergone
  mitotic modifications.
