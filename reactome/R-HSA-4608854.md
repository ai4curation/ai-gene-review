display_name: SMURF1/2 are recruited to the DVL2:PARD6A complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The E3 ubiquitin ligases SMURF1/2 are recruited to the DVL:PARD6A complex
  after WNT5A stimulation.  Recruitment depends on DVL2 phosphorylation and is mediated
  by the DEP domain of DVL2 that is important for PCP signaling (Narimatsu et al,
  2009; Boutros et al, 1998).  Smurf1 and 2 mutant mice show defects in convergent
  extension and neural tube closure, as well as misorientation of sensory hairs in
  the inner ear, phenotypes consistent with a role for SMURFs in the PCP pathway (Narimatsu
  et al, 2009).
