display_name: NEXT1 PEST domain mutants are cleaved to produce NICD1 PEST domain mutants
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NEXT1 PEST domain mutant fragments are expected to be cleaved by the gamma-secretase
  complex at the S3 site in a similar manner to wild-type NEXT1 (Schroeter et al.
  1998, De Strooper et al. 1999, Huppert et al. 2000, Fortini 2002, Rustighi et al.
