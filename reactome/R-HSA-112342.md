stable_id: R-HSA-112342
display_name: Inactivation of MAP2K1 by CDK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: At the beginning of this reaction, 2 molecules of 'ATP', and 1 molecule of
  'MEK1' are present. At the end of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'phospho_MEK1', and
  2 molecules of 'ADP' are present.<br>This reaction takes place in the 'cytosol'
  and  is mediated by the 'protein serine/threonine kinase activity' of 'phospho-Cdc2
  (Thr 161)'(Shah et al.2003 ).
