species: Homo sapiens
summary: Prekallikrein in a complex with kininogen and C1q binding protein on the
  plasma membrane is cleaved to generate active kallikrein, which remains bound to
  the complex. In the body, this reaction appears to occur on the surfaces of endothelial
  cells and may require the presence of activated platelets. Recent work indicates
  that the protease that cleaves prekallikrein under these conditions is prolylcarboxypeptidase.
  Although this enzyme was originally isolated from lysosomes (Odya et al. 1978; Tan
  et al. 1993), it is associated with plasma membranes of cultured human endothelial
  cells in vitro (Moreira et al. 2002; Shariat-Madar et al. 2002), and the purified
  recombinant enzyme efficiently cleaves prekallikrein (Shariat-Madar et al. 2004).
  In contrast factor XII, despite its activity on prekallikrein in vitro, appears
  not to be responsible for prekallikrein activation on the cell surface (Rojkjaer
  et al. 1998).
