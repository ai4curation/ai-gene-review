display_name: Phosphorylation and activation of VAV2/VAV3 by SYK
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'VAV exists in an auto-inhibitory state, folded in such a way as to inhibit
  the GEF activity of its DH domain. This folding is mediated through binding of tyrosines
  in the acidic domain to the DH domain and through binding of the calponin homology
  (CH) domain to the C1 region. Activation of VAV may involve three events which relieve
  this auto-inhibition: phosphorylation of tyrosines in the acidic domain causes them
  to be displaced from the DH domain; binding of a ligand to the CH domain may cause
  it to release the C1 domain; binding of the PI3K product PIP3 to the PH domain may
  alter its conformation (Aghazadeh et al. 2000). VAV2/3 are phosphorylated on Y172/Y173
  respectively in the acidic domain. This is mediated by SYK and Src-family tyrosine
  kinases (Deckert et al. 1996, Schuebel et al. 1998). Once activated, VAV2/VAV3 are
  involved in the activation of RAC1, PAK1, MEK and ERK.'
