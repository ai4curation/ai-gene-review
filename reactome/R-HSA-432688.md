display_name: trans-Golgi Network Derived Lysosomal Vesicle Uncoating
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The heat shock protein Hsc70 and auxilin, a J-domain containing protein,
  are responsible for clathrin disassembly through an ATP-dependent reaction. This
  uncoating step may be a point in the pathway subject to regulation. This final step
  releases the vesicle from the clathrin cage. The vesicle still contatins a specific
  Vamp molecule, part of the targeting and fusion mechanism that delivers the vesicle
  to its ultimate destination. This vesicle also contains its cargo, membrane proteins
  embeded in the lysosome membrane.
