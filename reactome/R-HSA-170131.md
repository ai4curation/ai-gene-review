summary: "The rapid translocation of cyclin B1:Cdc2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus\
  \ at the onset of mitosis is a result of an increase in the  rate of import and,\
  \ likely, a\r decreased  rate of export. The increased rate of nuclear import  is\
  \ dependent upon phosphorylation of the CRS which creates a nuclear import signal\
  \ in the amino terminus of cyclin B1 (Hagting et al, 1999)."

## Summary

The rapid translocation of cyclin B1:Cdc2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at the onset of mitosis is a result of an increase in the  rate of import and, likely, a decreased  rate of export. The increased rate of nuclear import  is dependent upon phosphorylation of the CRS which creates a nuclear import signal in the amino terminus of cyclin B1 (Hagting et al, 1999).
