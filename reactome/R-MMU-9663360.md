display_name: MET channel transports cations from the extracellular region into the
  cytosol of stereocilia of cochlear outer hair cell
species: Mus musculus
summary: 'The mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels (also called mechanotransducer
  channels) located at the tips of stereocilia on the apical surface of outer hair
  cells (OHCs) are opened by mechanical force exerted on the channels by Cdh23:Pcdh15
  tip links that traverse the tips of stereocilia (Siemens et al. 2004, Ahmed et al.
  2006, Kazmierczak et al. 2007, Narui and Sotomayor 2018, Oroz et al. 2019). A Cdh23
  dimer is connected to the cytoskeleton of a taller stereocilium via Ush1c (Harmonin),
  Ush1g (SANS), and Myo7a (MyoVIIa) (Boeda et al. 2002, Adato et al. 2005, Bahloul
  et al. 2010, Grati and Kachar 2011, Bahloul et al. 2017). By a calcium-dependent
  interaction, a Cdh23 dimer on a taller stereocilium is bound to a Pcdh15 dimer (Elledge
  et al. 2010, Schwander et al. 2009, Sotomayor et al. 2010) that is connected to
  a MET channel on a shorter stereocilium. The MET channel comprises at least Tmc1
  and Tmc2 (Kawashima et al. 2011, Pan et al. 2013, Beurg et al. 2015, Kurima et al.
  2015, Corns et al. 2016, Beurg et al. 2018, Pan et al. 2018, Beurg et al. 2019,

  (Michel et al. 2017, Wang et al. 2017) and Lhfpl5 (also called Tmhs), which interacts
  with Pcdh15 (Xiong et al. 2012, Geng et al. 2013, Beurg et al. 2015, Ge et al. 2018).
  In mice, Tmc2 expression is highest during the first week after birth and decreases
  in adulthood; Tmc1 expression is low in the first week after birth and increases

  et al. 2017) and potassium ions to pass from the extracellular scala media to the

## Summary

The mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels (also called mechanotransducer channels) located at the tips of stereocilia on the apical surface of outer hair cells (OHCs) are opened by mechanical force exerted on the channels by Cdh23:Pcdh15 tip links that traverse the tips of stereocilia (Siemens et al. 2004, Ahmed et al. 2006, Kazmierczak et al. 2007, Narui and Sotomayor 2018, Oroz et al. 2019).
