display_name: Desaturation of eicosatetraenoyl-CoA to eicosapentaenoyl-CoA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Eicosatetraenoyl-CoA (ETA-CoA) is desaturated by an additional carbon-carbon
  bond to form 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z-eicosapentaenoyl-CoA (EPA-CoA, 5,8,11,14,17-20:5(n-3)).
  Delta-5-desaturase is required for this conversion. EPA-CoA has health benefits
  due to its anti-inflammatory actions. It is a precursor for the anti-inflammatory
  series-3 prostaglandins (PG), the series-5 leukotrienes (LT) and the series-3 thromboxanes
  (TA), which are anti-atherogenic and anti-thrombogenic (Ross et al. 2009).
