stable_id: R-HSA-981680
display_name: C4b binding protein displaces C2a
species: Homo sapiens
summary: C4 binding protein accelerates the decay of C4bC2a in a dose-dependent fashion.
  The mechanism of this is poorly understood, but is distinct from Factor I mediated
  degradation of C4b and believed to represent the displacement of C2a from specific
  binding sites on C4b (Gigli et al. 1979).
