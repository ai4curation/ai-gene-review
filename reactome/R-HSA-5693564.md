display_name: Association of RAD51 with RAD52:DNA double-strand break ends
species: Homo sapiens
summary: RAD52 can simultaneously interact with RAD51 and RPA. The interaction with
  RAD51 may inhibit the formation of the invading RAD51 filament by sequestering RAD51
  from RPA, thus promoting single strand annealing (SSA) instead of homologous recombination
  (Chen et al. 1999, Stark et al. 2004, Singleton et al. 2002, Mansour et al. 2008).
  The interaction of RAD51 and RAD52 is promoted by ABL1-mediated phosphorylation
  of both RAD51 and RAD52 (Chen et al. 1999, Van Dyck et al. 1999), which also increases
  RAD52 affinity for DNA (Honda et al. 2011).
