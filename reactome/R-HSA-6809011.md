display_name: cis-Golgi t-SNAREs bind YKT6 on tethered vesicle
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Membrane fusion is mediated by the zippering of a four membered anti-parallel
  helix bundle formed by the v-SNARE and the three t-SNARES. t-SNARE complexes that
  are found at the cis-Golgi include STX5:GOSR1:GOSR2, STX5:GOSR1:BET1 and STX5:GOSR1:BET1L
  among others (Xu et al, 2002; Zhang et al 1997; Volchuk et al, 2004; reviewed in
