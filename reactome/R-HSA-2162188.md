display_name: COQ5 methylates MDMQ10H2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 2-methoxy-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinol methylase (COQ5) catalyses the C-methyltransferase
  conversion of 2-methoxy-6-decaprenyl-1,4-benzoquinol (MDMQ10H2) to 6-methoxy-3-methyl-2-decaprenyl-1,4-benzoquinol
  (DMQ10H2). The monomer, while localized in the mitochondrial matrix, is part of
  a multimeric complex associated to the mitochondrial inner membrane (Chen et al.,
  2013; Nguyen et al., 2015; Yen et al., 2016). The activity was confirmed with an
  in vitro assay using a short chain substrate analog and a resurrected ancestral
  COQ5 (Nicoll et al., 2024). This reaction was first studied in yeast (Barkovich
  et al. 1997).
