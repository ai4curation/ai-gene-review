stable_id: R-HSA-8936058
display_name: miR-675 binds RUNX1 mRNA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Mature single stranded microRNA miR-675-5p is one of the two products of
  miR-675, which is produced from a precursor long non-coding RNA H19 (Cai and Cullen
  2007). miR-675-5p binds to the 3'UTR of RUNX1 mRNA, resulting in decreased RUNX1
  mRNA and protein levels. As it decreases RUNX1 mRNA levels, miR-675 is assumed to
  function as a component of the endonucleolytic RISC, but it is possible that it
  additionally functions as a component of the nonendonucleolytic RISC. Levels of
  miR-675 are increased in gastric cancer (Zhuang et al. 2014).
