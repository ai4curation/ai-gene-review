summary: <p>FZR1 (also known as CDH1 or Fizzy-related protein homolog or CDC20-like
  protein 1 or Cdh1/Hct1 homolog), a substrate-specific adapter for the anaphase promoting
  complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, was found to
  bind to CCNA2 specifically in G2 as compared with S phase (Pagliuca et al. 2011)
  and was reproducibly identified as a substrate of CCNA:CDK1 (Mitra et al. 2006,
  Dumitru et al. 2017). CCNA:CDK2 and CCNA:CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of FZR1 inhibits
