stable_id: R-MMU-9006327
display_name: Phospho-Jak2 phosphorylates Epor
species: Mus musculus
summary: Phosphorylated Jak2 phosphorylates 8 tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic
  tail of Epor (Miura et al. 1001, Damen et al. 1992, Yoshimura and Lodish 1992, Witthuhn
  et al. 1993, Miura et al. 1994, Sawyer and Penta 1996, Tilbrook et al. 1996, Ueda
  et al. 2017). The phosphorylated residues then serve as binding sites for downstream
  signaling molecules such as Stat5, phospholipase C, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (Sawyer and Penta 1996).
