display_name: CASP8 cleaves N4BP1 at D424, D490
species: Homo sapiens
summary: NEDD4-binding protein 1 (N4BP1) limits the activation of NF-kappaB downstream
  of TICAM1 (TRIF)-independent Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR7 or TLR9 signaling
  pathways, but not upon engagement of TLR3 or TLR4 which utilize the adaptor protein
  TICAM1 (Shi H et al. 2021; Gitlin AD et al. 2020). TLR3- or TRL4-induced TICAM1-dependent
  activation of caspase-8 (CASP8) was found to inactivate N4BP1 via the proteolytic
  cleavage thus promoting NF-kappa-B activation (Gitlin AD et al. 2020; Shi H et al.
  2021). Functional studies of N4BP1 mutants expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T
  (HEK293T) cells suggest that human N4BP1 is cleaved after D424 and/or D490 (Shi
  H et al. 2021).
