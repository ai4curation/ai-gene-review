stable_id: R-HSA-388832
display_name: PI3K binds CD28
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The phosphorylated YMNM motif in CD28 interacts with the Src homology 2 (SH2)
  domain of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, leading to the activation of the p110
  catalytic subunit. P110alpha and p110beta are broadly expressed in most cell types,
  whereas p110γgamma and p110delta expression is more limited to cells of the immune
  system. This activation allows PI3K to generate 3′-phosphoinositides, such as PIP3,
  which serve as docking sites for various signaling proteins containing pleckstrin
  homology (PH) domains (pages et al. 1994, Appleman et al. 2002, Vanhaesebroeck et
  al. 2010).
