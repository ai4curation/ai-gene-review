display_name: C-terminal Hh fragments are bound by lectins
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Promotion of the cholesterol-mediated autocleavage reaction is the only well
  documented role for the C-terminal region of intact Hh (reviewed in Briscoe and
  Therond, 2013), and recent in vitro studies suggest that the Hh-C fragment generated
  by autocleavage is subsequently targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated
  degradation (ERAD) pathway (Chen et al, 2011; Huang et al, 2013).  This pathway
  delivers N-glycosylated ER-resident substrates to a retrotranslocation channel,
  where they are ubiquitinated and translocated to the cytosol for proteasome-mediated
  degradation in an ATP-ase dependent fashion (reviewed in Vembar and Brodsky, 2008).  Recognition
  and targettng of ER proteins for the ERAD pathway depends at least in part on modification
  and binding of the glycosyl groups.  Consistent with this, depletion of the lectins
  OS9 and ERLEC1 abrogates degradation of the Hh-C fragments (Chen et al, 2011).  OS9
  and ERLEC1 may target Hh-C to the retrotranslocation channel by virtue of their
  interaction with SEL1, an ER membrane protein with established roles in the ERAD
  pathway (Christianson et al, 2008; Mueller et al, 2008; Hosokawa et al, 2008; Hosokawa
  et al, 2009).

## Summary

Promotion of the cholesterol-mediated autocleavage reaction is the only well documented role for the C-terminal region of intact Hh (reviewed in Briscoe and Therond, 2013), and recent in vitro studies suggest that the Hh-C fragment generated by autocleavage is subsequently targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Chen et al, 2011; Huang et al, 2013).
