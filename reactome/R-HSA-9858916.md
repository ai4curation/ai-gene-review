stable_id: R-HSA-9858916
display_name: MITF-M-dependent ATP6V1H gene expression
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MITF has been implicated in the regulation of expression of many components
  of the v-ATPase, including the cytosollic component ATP6V1H (Zhang et al, 2015).
  The v-ATPase is responsible for acidification of organelles such as the lysosome
  and the endosome. The lysosome is also a site of regulation of TORC1 (target of
  rapamycin complex 1) that promotes global protein synthesis. MITF-family members
  and TORC1 play varied but interconnected roles in the sensing and response to nutrient
  levels, with MITF either positively or negatively regulating TORC activity depending
  on context (reviewed in Martina et al, 2014), and TORC1 and RAG GTPases have been
  shown to regulate the localization of some MITF family members (Martina and Puertollano,
  2019). MITF has also been implicated as a regulator in a subset of genes associated
  with autophagy and lysosome biogenesis (Ploper et al, 2015; Moller et al, 2019;
  reviewed in Ploper and Robertis, 2015; Goding and Arnheiter, 2019).
