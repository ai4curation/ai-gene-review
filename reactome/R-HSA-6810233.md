display_name: CDK7 phosphorylates serine-5 and serine-7 of heptad repeats in C-terminal
  domain of RNA polymerase II at snRNA promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CDK7 phosphorylates serine-5 residues of heptad repeats (consensus YSPTSPS)
  in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit (POLR2A) of RNA polymerase II.
  Serine-7 residues of the heptad repeats are also phosphorylated at promoters of
  snRNA genes (Egloff et al. 2007) and CDK7 is required for phosphorylation of serine-7
  in vivo (Glover-Cutter et al. 2009). P-TEFb and DNA-PK are able to phosphorylate
  serine-7 in vitro (Glover-Cutter et al. 2009, Egloff et al. 2010). Impairment of
  CTD phosphorylation does not appear to affect transcription of snRNA genes but rather
  impairs 3' processing of the pre-snRNA (Medlin et al. 2003, Jacobs et al. 2004).
