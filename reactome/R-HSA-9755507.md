display_name: UBXN7:UBF1:NPLOC4:VCP hexamer binds NFE2L2:CRL3 complex
species: Homo sapiens
summary: VCP (also known as p97) is a hexameric ATPase with known roles in extracting
  ubiquinated substrates from multimeric E3 ligase complexes to promote their degradation
  by the 26S proteasome (Richly et al, 2005; Meyer et al, 2000; Rape et al, 2001;
  Tao et al, 2017; reviewed in van den Boom and Meyer, 2018). VCP has been shown to
  promote the extraction of ubiquitinated NFE2L2 from the KEAP1:CUL3:RBX1 complex
  in association with co-factors UBF1 and NPLOC4. UBXN7 also plays a role in the regulation
  of NFE2L2 protein levels, and interacts with VCP, UBF1 and NPLOC4 (Tao et al, 2017;
  Di Gregario et al, 2021).
