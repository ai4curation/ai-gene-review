display_name: POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG bind the DKK1 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: The DKK1 gene is bound by POU5F1 (OCT4) (Boyer et al. 2005, Jin et al. 2007,
  Jung et al. 2010), SOX2 (Lister et al. 2009), and NANOG (Boyer et al. 2005, Lister
  et al. 2009) in embryonic stem cells and POU5F1 (Babaie et al. 2007, Kunarso et
  al. 2010) represses expression. In mesenchymal stem cells, however, SOX2 appears
  to activate DKK1 expression (Park et al. 2012). DKK1 is a soluble inhibitor of Wnt
  signaling that binds the LRP5 receptor (reviewed in Pinzone et al. 2009). As inferred
  from mouse, DKK1 induces differentiation to neuroectoderm (Kong and Zhang 2009).
