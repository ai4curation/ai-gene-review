display_name: Dissociation of CaM and CAMK2 autophosphorylation
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Dissociation of Ca2+/CaM from activated CAMK2 allows subsequent phosphorylations
  at Thr 305 and Thr 306.  These phosphorylations, which occur within the CaM binding
  site, prevent reassociation of Ca2+/CaM (reviewed in Stratton et al, 2013).

## Summary

Dissociation of Ca2+/CaM from activated CAMK2 allows subsequent phosphorylations at Thr 305 and Thr 306.  These phosphorylations, which occur within the CaM binding site, prevent reassociation of Ca2+/CaM (reviewed in Stratton et al, 2013).
