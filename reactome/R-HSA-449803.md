stable_id: R-HSA-449803
display_name: IL10 dimer binds IL10RA:JAK1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'The IL-10 receptor is composed of at least two subunits, both members of
  the interferon receptor (IFNR) family (Liu et al. 1994). Interferon-10 receptor
  alpha chain (IL10RA) is the ligand-binding subunit, binding IL-10 with high affinity
  (Kd 35-200 pM) (Tan et al. 1993). IL10RA is constitutively associated with JAK1
  (Moore et al. 2001, Usacheva et al. 2002). This association is dependent on a membrane-proximal
  part of the receptor (amino acids 269-274) which contain a region designated the
  box 2B motif, characterized by a core of four hydrophobic residues flanked by a
  serine and charged residues (Usacheva et al. 2002). '
