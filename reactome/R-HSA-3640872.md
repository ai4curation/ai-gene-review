display_name: USP34 deubiquitinates AXIN1,AXIN2
species: Homo sapiens
summary: UBP34 (also known as USP34) is a ubiquitin protease that co-precipitates
  in AXIN-containing complexes.  In vitro studies show that the core domain of UBP34
  is able to deubiquitinate AXIN purified from HEK293 transfected cells, and knockdown
  of UBP34 reduces AXIN1 protein levels in vivo. Treatment of UBP34-knockdown cells
  with the tankyrase inhibitor XAV939 reverses the degradation of AXIN, suggesting
  that the activity of UBP34 counteracts the tankyrase-dependent ubiquitination and
  degradation of AXIN. UBP34 plays a not-fully characterized role in the nuclear accumulation
  of AXIN, where AXIN is thought to positively regulate beta-catenin mediated transcription
  (Lui et al, 2011).
