summary: In the second step in the formation of glutathione, gamma-glutamylcysteine
  (gGluCys) ligates with glycine (Gly) to form glutathione (GSH) (Gali & Board 1995).
  This reaction is catalysed by glutathione synthetase (GSS), a homodimeric enzyme
  present in the cytosol which requires one Mg2+ cofactor per subunit for activity
  (Polekhina et al. 1999).
