summary: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a key regulator
  of gene expression in response to signaling of many cytokines including interleukin-6
  (IL6), Oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Using microarray techniques,
  hundreds of genes have been reported as potential STAT3 target genes (Dauer et al.
  2005, Hsieh et al. 2005). Some of these genes have been proven to be direct STAT3
  targets using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation screening (Snyder et al.
  2008, Carpenter & Lo 2014). Genes for cytoplasmic proteins upregulated by STAT3
  include Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) (He et al. 2003), Induced myeloid
  leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl-1 (MCL1) (Becker et al. 2014), Heat shock
  protein HSP 90-alpha (HSP90AA1) (Chen et al. 2007), Fascin (FSCN1) (Snyder et al.
  2011), Vimentin (VIM) (Wu et al. 2004), Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoU (RHOU)
  (Schiavone et al. 2009), RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT1) (Xu et
  al. 2005), Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (CDKN1A) (Bellido et al. 1998), Phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase regulatory subunit alpha (PIK3R1) (Abell et al. 2005), Signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) (Han et al. 2013), Interferon regulatory
  factor 4 (IRF4) (Durant et al. 2010) and Nitric oxide synthase, inducible (NOS2)
  (Lo et al. 2005).
