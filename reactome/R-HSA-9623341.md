stable_id: R-HSA-9623341
display_name: p-S133 CREB1 dimer binds the CCND1 promoter
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Estrogen stimulation promotes cell cycle progression in a number of cell
  lines by upregulating the expression of the G1 cyclin CCND1 (Cyclin D1) (Castoria
  et al,1999; Castoria et al, 2001; reviewed in Castoria et al, 2010). Estrogen-responsive
  CCND1 expression is promoted through both the canonical ESR1 receptor and through
  the alternate receptor GPER1 (Castoria et al, 2001; Castoria et al, 2012; Kanda
  and Watanabe, 2003; Kanda and Watanabe, 2004). By electrophoretic mobility shift
  assay, phosphorylated CREB1 binds to a CRE element in the CCND1 promoter, and expression
  of a CRE-driven CCND1 reporter gene increases upon stimulation of cells with E2
  (Kanda and Watanbe, 2003; Kanda and Watanabe, 2004). Expression of CCND1 downstream
  of E2 and ESR1 or GPER1 stimulates cellular proliferation, consistent with studies
  in other cell lines (Vivacqua et al, 2006a; Vivacqua et al, 2006b; Albanito et al,
  2007; Albanito et al, 2008; Lin et al, 2009; Ariazi et al, 2010; reviewed in Filardo,
  2018).
