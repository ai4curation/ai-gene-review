stable_id: R-RNO-9620205
display_name: Hspa8:Rnase1 binds Lamp2a
species: Rattus norvegicus
summary: 'Intracellular proteins are targeted for proteolytic degradation in lysosome
  with the aid of chaperones. Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8) acts as the
  constitutive chaperone that binds Ribonuclease pancreatic beta-type (Rnase1) in
  the cytosol. Consequently, the Rnase1:Hspa8 complex translocates from cytosol to
  lysosomal membrane where it binds to Lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2
  (Lamp2) (Cuervo AM and Dice JF. 1996). Four positively charged amino acids in the
  cytosolic tail of the Lamp2a isoform is known to regulate the binding mechanism
  (Cuervo AM and Dice JF. 2000). '
