display_name: Beta-catenin recruits SMARCA4
species: Homo sapiens
summary: SMARCA4, one of two ATPase components of SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes,
  was identified in a two-hybrid screen for beta-catenin interactors that activate
  TCF/LEF-dependent transcription (Barker et al, 2001; Wilson and Roberts, 2011).   SMARCA4
  co-immunoprecipitates with beta-catenin when both tagged proteins are expressed
  in HEK293 cells; likewise, tagged SMARCA4 co-precipitates endogenous beta-catenin
  from a colon carcinoma cell line.   Expression of SMARCA4 enhances the expression
  of a TCF reporter in a manner that depends on a functional ATPase domain, indicating
  a probable role for chromatin remodelling at WNT-responsive promoters (Barker et
  al, 2001).  By ChIP, SMARCA4 and beta-catenin are associated with WNT-responsive
  promoters upon WNT pathway stimulation; this study also identified TERT, a telomerase
  reverse transcriptase, as SMARCA4-interacting protein that is present at WNT promoters
  (Park et al, 2009).
