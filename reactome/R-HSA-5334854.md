display_name: RAR:RXR binds SUMO-CRABP2:atRA
species: Homo sapiens
summary: In the nucleus, cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2), bound
  to all trans retinoic acid (atRA), directly binds to heterodimeric nuclear retinoic
  acid receptors (RAR:RXR) to form a complex through which atRA is channeled from
  the binding protein to RAR (Majumdar et al. 2011). The RAR:RXR heterodimer can be
  formed between any of three receptor isoforms for each; RARA, RARB, or RARG with
  RXRA, RXRB, or RXRG (Neiderreither and Dolle 2008). RARA requires sumoylation and
  phosphorylation for ligand binding and nuclear localisation (Zhu et al. 2009, Santos
  & Kim 2010).<br><br>RAR:RXR bind to their RA response elements (RARE, composed of
  tandem direct repeats of 5'-AGGTCA-3' spaced by either 2 bp or 5 bp (DR2, DR5) in
  response to their physiological ligand atRA, and regulate gene expression in various
  biological processes.
