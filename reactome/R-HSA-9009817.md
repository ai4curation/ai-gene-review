summary: Retinoids (vitamin A and its metabolites) are regulators of many cellular
  activities, including cellular growth and differentiation, and they mediate many
  essential regulatory functions. Biologically active retinoids exert their effects
  by binding to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARA, RARB and RARG), bound to their
  respective retinoid-X-receptors (RXRA, RXRB and RXRG). Acitretin (trade names Soriatane
  and Neotigason) is a second-generation synthestic retinoid. It is classed as a keratolytic
  agent and taken orally in the treament of severe resistant psoriasis. Acitretin
  is the active metabolite of etretinate and is the retinoid of choice for treating
  psoriasis because of its more favorable pharmacokinetic profile over etretinate.
  Despite clinically proven success in treating psoriasis, the mechanism of action
  of acitretin has not been fully elucidated but it is an agonist for all three subtypes
  of nuclear retinoic acid receptors, through which it may normalise keratinocyte
  proliferation, epidermal differentiation and keratinisation (Beckenbach et al. 2015).<p>ADAM10
  (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10) has been identified as the major physiological
  alpha-secretase in neurons (Kuhn et al. 2010), responsible for cleaving amyloid
  precursor protein (APP) in a non-amyloidogenic manner and producing APPs-alpha,
  a neuroprotective APP-derived peptide (Mockett et al. 2017, Endres & Deller 2017).
  Increasing ADAM10 activity may be an attractive target for the treatment of neurodegenerative
  diseases. However, it must be noted that ADAM10 is also implicated in the ectodomain
  shedding of NOTCH and ERB2, which can promote cancer progression and inflammatory
  diseases. Both, RARA and RARB are capable of inducing human ADAM10 promoter activity
  (Tippmann et al. 2009). In addition, treatment with acitretin (via binding to these
  receptors) shifts APP processing in AD model mice toward the alpha-secretase cleavage
  pathway (Tippmann et al. 2009).
