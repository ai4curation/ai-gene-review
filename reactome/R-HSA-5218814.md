stable_id: R-HSA-5218814
display_name: PAK2 autophorylates
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PAK2 undergoes autophosphorylation on serine and threonine residues, which
  maintains PAK2 in a catalytically active state. PAK is autophosphorylated at several
  sites but S141 flanking the kinase inhibitor region and T402 within the catalytic
  domain are the two conserved sites that regulate the catalytic activity (Chong et
  al. 2001, Gatti et al. 1999).
