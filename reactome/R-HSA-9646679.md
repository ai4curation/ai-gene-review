display_name: PolyUb-Misfolded proteins bind vimentin to form aggresome
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Dynein motor complex drives the multi-ubiquitinated misfolded proteins along
  the microtubule towards the microtubule organizing center. Here, intermediate filament
  proteins such as vimentin (VIM) are redistributed to ensheath misfolded proteins
  to form the aggresome (Johnston JA et al. 1998). Subsequently, the aggresome is
  removed with the help of autophagy machinery.

## Summary

Dynein motor complex drives the multi-ubiquitinated misfolded proteins along the microtubule towards the microtubule organizing center. Here, intermediate filament proteins such as vimentin (VIM) are redistributed to ensheath misfolded proteins to form the aggresome (Johnston JA et al. 1998). Subsequently, the aggresome is removed with the help of autophagy machinery.
