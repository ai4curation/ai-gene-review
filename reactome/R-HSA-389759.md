display_name: Interaction of SHP-1 or SHP-2 with phospho PD-1
species: Homo sapiens
summary: Once phosphorylated, SH2-domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and
  SHP-2 bind to the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibitory Motif (ITIM) and the
  Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Switch Motif (ITSM) of PD-1. This interaction is crucial
  for PD-1's inhibitory signaling pathway. Both phosphatases play significant roles
  in modulating T cell responses by dephosphorylating key signaling molecules involved
  in T cell activation. SHP-2, in particular, contributes to the attenuation of T
  cell receptor (TCR) signaling by dephosphorylating molecules such as CD3-zeta and
  PI3K, leading to reduced activation and proliferation of T cells (Chemnitz 1 et
  al. 2004).
