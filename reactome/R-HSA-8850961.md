display_name: PREX2 binds PTEN and inhibits it
species: Homo sapiens
summary: PREX2, a RAC1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), binds to PTEN and
  inhibits its catalytic activity, resulting in enhanced PI3K/AKT signaling (Fine
  et al. 2009). The interaction involves the inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase
  domain and the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PREX2 and the PDZ binding domain,
  the phosphatase domain and the C2 domain of PTEN (Fine et al. 2009, Hodakoski et
  al. 2014). PREX2 binds both the unphosphorylated PTEN and PTEN phosphorylated at
  the C-terminal tail by casein kinase II, but inhibits the lipid phosphatase activity
  of phosphorylated PTEN only (Hodakoski et al. 2014). The GEF activity of PREX2 is
  not needed for PTEN inhibition (Fine et al. 2009).<p>PREX2 is frequently overexpressed
  in breast and prostate cancer (Fine et al. 2009) and mutated in melanoma (Berger
  et al. 2012).
