stable_id: R-HSA-1112690
display_name: PTPN11 binds CBL
species: Homo sapiens
summary: 'SHP2 binds CBL in response to IL-6 stimulation in 293T cells and contributes
  to the ubiquitination of gp130 (Tanaka et al. 2008).<br>

  IL-6 stimulation induced lysosome-dependent degradation of gp130, which correlated
  with an increase in its K63-linked polyubiquitination. This  stimulation-dependent
  ubiquitination was mediated by CBL, an E3 ligase, which was recruited to gp130 in
  a tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP2-dependent manner. IL-6 induced a rapid translocation
  of gp130 from the cell surface to endosomal compartments. The vesicular sorting
  molecule Hrs contributed to the lysosomal degradation of gp130 by directly recognizing
  its ubiquitinated form. Deficiency of either Hrs or CBL suppressed gp130 degradation,
  leading to a prolonged and amplified IL-6 signal. '
