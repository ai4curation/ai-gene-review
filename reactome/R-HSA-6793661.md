display_name: (CDK1,CDK2):CCNA phosphorylates MDM2 at T218
species: Homo sapiens
summary: CDK1 or CDK2 in complex with CCNA (cyclin A) phosphorylates MDM2 at threonine
  residue T218. Phosphorylation of MDM2 at T218 increases its affinity for p14-ARF
  and reduces its affinity for TP53 (p53), thus resulting in TP53 upregulation (Zhang
  and Prives 2001).

## Summary

CDK1 or CDK2 in complex with CCNA (cyclin A) phosphorylates MDM2 at threonine residue T218. Phosphorylation of MDM2 at T218 increases its affinity for p14-ARF and reduces its affinity for TP53 (p53), thus resulting in TP53 upregulation (Zhang and Prives 2001).
