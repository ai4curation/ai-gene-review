## Summary

ALK induces expression of the plasma membrane immunosuppressive protein CD274, a ligand for the programmed cell death 1 receptor CD279. Interaction of CD274 with its CD279 receptor promotes normal T cell immune function and contributes to immune evasion in malignant cells (reviewed in Kythreotou et al, 2017). 
ALK-induced expression of CD274 depends on ALK kinase activity and promotes direct binding of STAT3 to its cognate site in the CD274 promoter as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and ChIP (Marzec et al, 2008).
