display_name: NSUN4 methylates cytidine-841 of 12S rRNA yielding 5-methylcytidine-841
species: Homo sapiens
summary: MTERF4 forms a complex with NSUN4 (Camara et al. 2011, Spahr et al. 2012,
  Yakubovskaya et al. 2012) and recruits NSUN4 to the ribosome where NSUN4 transfers
  a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the 5 position of cytidine-841 in 12S
  rRNA (Camara et al. 2011). Knockout of MTERF4 in mice is lethal and cardiomyocyte-specific
  knockout is accompanied by mitochondrial cardiomyopathy (Camara et al. 2011).
