<h1 id="over-annotation-in-the-gene-ontology-causes-impact-and-solutions">Over-Annotation in the Gene Ontology: Causes, Impact, and Solutions</h1>
<h2 id="understanding-over-annotation-in-go">Understanding Over-Annotation in GO</h2>
<p>Over-annotation in the Gene Ontology (GO) refers to a situation where a gene product is associated with an excessive number of GO terms, often including very general or indirectly supported terms. In principle, GO curators strive to annotate each gene with the <strong>most specific</strong> terms supported by evidence, rather than a multitude of broad terms<a href="https://advaitabio.com/faq-items/understanding-gene-ontology/#:~:text=When%20annotating%20genes%20with%20GO,%E2%80%9Cinduction%20of%20apoptosis%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Capoptosis%E2%80%9D">[1]</a>. For example, if a gene’s role is known to be the induction of apoptosis by hormones, it should be annotated to <em>“induction of apoptosis by hormones”</em> (a specific term) instead of higher-level terms like <em>“induction of apoptosis”</em> or <em>“apoptosis”</em><a href="https://advaitabio.com/faq-items/understanding-gene-ontology/#:~:text=When%20annotating%20genes%20with%20GO,%E2%80%9Cinduction%20of%20apoptosis%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Capoptosis%E2%80%9D">[1]</a>. Over-annotation arises when this principle is not followed, or when annotations accumulate without consistent curation, leading some genes to have dozens of GO terms. In extreme cases, curators may unintentionally “annotate to the experiment” – i.e. assign GO terms corresponding to a broad phenotype or experimental outcome rather than the gene’s direct role – which can introduce overly general Biological Process annotations. GO’s documentation explicitly notes that annotations should capture a gene product’s normal function, process, or location, whereas mutant phenotypes or disease roles are <strong>out of scope</strong> for GO annotations<a href="http://geneontology.org/docs/go-annotations/#:~:text=,is%20located%20when%20the%20activity">[2]</a>. When curators or automated pipelines do not adhere strictly to these guidelines, a gene can end up with many high-level or redundant terms, obscuring its core functions. Over-annotation thus reflects not deliberate misuse, but the challenge of consistently applying annotation rules across different curators, organisms, and eras of curation.</p>
<h2 id="causes-and-processes-leading-to-over-annotation">Causes and Processes Leading to Over-Annotation</h2>
<p>Several factors contribute to over-annotation in GO. A primary cause is <strong>inconsistent curatorial practices</strong> across different groups or time periods. In the past, some curators annotated genes to very broad Biological Process (BP) terms based on observable phenotypes. For instance, a knockout that causes a slow-growth phenotype might have led to annotating the gene to a broad process like “growth” or “development,” even if the gene’s direct action was in a specific pathway. This practice “annotates the phenotype” rather than the gene’s mechanistic role, inflating the number of BP annotations per gene. Modern GO standards discourage such broad attributions; curators are expected to find a more specific child term (e.g. a particular signaling or metabolic process affecting growth) or use phenotype ontologies separately, since GO’s scope is normal biological function<a href="http://geneontology.org/docs/go-annotations/#:~:text=,is%20located%20when%20the%20activity">[2]</a><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Those%20that%20are%20inappropriate%20for,for%20all%20gene%20products%20annotated">[3]</a>. Another driver of over-annotation is the <strong>hierarchical structure of GO</strong>. By GO’s true-path rule, an annotation to a specific term implies that all parent terms are also valid for that gene<a href="https://advaitabio.com/faq-items/understanding-gene-ontology/#:~:text=When%20a%20gene%20is%20annotated,%E2%80%9D%20But%2C%20because">[4]</a>. In well-maintained annotations, curators usually add only the most specific term and allow parent terms to be inferred; however, if curators manually add multiple parent terms (for thoroughness or due to older tool pipelines), this creates redundant annotations. A historical annotation might list both a granular term and all its ancestors for a single piece of evidence, effectively over-annotating the gene with many levels of the ontology.</p>
<p><strong>Automated annotation pipelines</strong> can also contribute. Electronic annotations (e.g. InterPro2GO mappings or automated transfer of annotations between orthologs) sometimes use broad terms when specific ones cannot be identified. For example, a conserved protein domain might only be linked to a high-level process term, leading all proteins with that domain to get that broad annotation automatically. Similarly, early versions of annotation propagation could add general “response to stress” or “transcription” terms to many genes based on limited data. GO curators recognized this issue: since 2012 the consortium has flagged certain terms as <strong>not for direct annotation</strong> because they are overly general<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Those%20that%20are%20inappropriate%20for,not%20be%20possible%20to%20choose">[5]</a>. For instance, the term <em>“response to stress”</em> (GO:0006950) is considered too broad to be useful for manual curation; curators are instructed to choose a more specific child term detailing the type of stress whenever possible<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Those%20that%20are%20inappropriate%20for,for%20all%20gene%20products%20annotated">[6]</a>. If a paper only says a gene is involved in “stress response” without specifics, a direct annotation to <em>“response to stress”</em> is now avoided in manual annotation. (The term is still allowed in automated electronic annotations, where specificity might not be attainable<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Those%20that%20are%20inappropriate%20for,for%20all%20gene%20products%20annotated">[3]</a>.) Such guidelines aim to prevent over-annotation with catch-all terms.</p>
<p>Another contributing factor is <strong>annotation transfer among gene families and paralogs</strong>. Modern GO curation uses tools like <strong>PAINT</strong> (Phylogenetic Annotation and INference Tool) to propagate experimentally-supported annotations across orthologous genes. This greatly expands annotation coverage, especially for less-studied species, but if not careful it can also propagate a broad function to many family members that may not all truly perform that role. PAINT curators mitigate this by manually reviewing each propagated annotation in the context of the phylogenetic tree, adding a “NOT” qualifier to genes where the function was lost or is not present<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Obsoleting%20terms%20from%20the%20ontologies">[7]</a><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=products%20that%20were%20associated%20with,accuracy%20of%20the%20resulting%20annotations">[8]</a>. Nonetheless, the propagation process can increase the number of annotations per gene (since a single experimentally characterized function in one species may be assigned to dozens of orthologs). In some cases paralogous genes get <strong>over-annotated</strong> – one well-studied paralog’s many functions might be bulk-assigned to its relatives by sequence similarity inference, even if some functions are lineage-specific. Ensuring that ISS/ISA (sequence similarity) annotations are made only when the source gene has experimental evidence for that term is one safeguard: for example, FlyBase curators require that a sequence-based annotation (ISS) be traceable to an experimentally annotated ortholog, to avoid propagating dubious functions<a href="https://wiki.flybase.org/wiki/FlyBase:Gene_Ontology_(GO)_Annotation#:~:text=FlyBase%20captures%20GO%20data%20based,before%20making%20an%20ISS">[9]</a>. High-throughput experiments pose another challenge: GO has special evidence codes (HDA, HMP, etc.) for high-throughput data, and curators only accept such annotations if they meet strict criteria to minimize false positives<a href="https://wiki.flybase.org/wiki/FlyBase:Gene_Ontology_(GO)_Annotation#:~:text=Infrequently%2C%20GO%20annotations%20will%20be,driven%20experiments">[10]</a>. In summary, over-annotation often stems from well-intentioned attempts to be comprehensive or to leverage all available data, but without consistent rules it leads to <strong>too many or too general GO terms per gene</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="impact-of-over-annotation-on-research">Impact of Over-Annotation on Research</h2>
<p>Over-annotation has significant downstream consequences for both biologists and computational analyses. One major impact is the introduction of bias in functional enrichment and gene function prediction analyses. Genes with many annotations – sometimes called <em>“multifunctional”</em> genes – can skew results by appearing relevant to numerous processes or functions simply because they are annotated to so many GO terms. <strong>Pavlidis et al.</strong> demonstrated this effect: if one ranks genes by the sheer number of GO categories they belong to, that ranking alone achieves surprisingly high performance in gene function prediction benchmarks<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017258#:~:text=the%20gene%20with%20the%20most,By%20itself%2C%20this%20is">[11]</a>. In their study, a single list of genes ordered by annotation count yielded an average AUC of 0.90 in predicting GO term membership – a essentially <em>“predicting”</em> functions by picking genes that are annotated with many functions already<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017258#:~:text=correct%20prediction%20more%20often%20across,of%20the%20apparent%20learnability%20of">[12]</a>. This result is not because those genes truly drive all functions, but because any gene in 100 GO categories is statistically likely to be in whatever category you test (relative to a gene in only one category)<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017258#:~:text=the%20gene%20with%20the%20most,By%20itself%2C%20this%20is">[11]</a>. The authors point out this is a <em>circular</em> and spurious form of prediction – it reveals that many computational methods inadvertently latch onto multifunctionality signals rather than specific biological associations<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017258#:~:text=is%20obtained%20in%20a%20%E2%80%9Ccircular%E2%80%9D,association%E2%80%9D">[13]</a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017258#:~:text=the%20distribution%20of%20GO%20annotations,can%20be%20attributed%20to%20multifunctionality">[14]</a>. In other words, over-annotated genes inflate performance metrics in gene network analysis and <em>“guilt-by-association”</em> predictions, calling into question how much of the signal is biologically meaningful<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017258#:~:text=1A%2C%20ranking%20genes%20by%20multifunctionality,different%20for%20different%20performance%20measures">[15]</a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017258#:~:text=assign%20new%20functions%20to%20genes,different%20for%20different%20performance%20measures">[16]</a>. Algorithms may appear to predict gene functions well by simply picking hub genes that have high annotation counts, a bias that needs to be controlled<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017258#:~:text=1A%2C%20ranking%20genes%20by%20multifunctionality,different%20for%20different%20performance%20measures">[15]</a>.</p>
<p>Another impact is on <strong>GO enrichment analysis</strong>, a common step in genomics studies. Over-annotated genes (often pivotal, well-studied genes like p53, TNF, etc.) tend to appear in many gene lists and contribute to many GO terms being enriched. This can lead researchers to chase broad, generic processes that are enriched largely due to one or two highly annotated genes in their dataset. A 2018 study quantified the inequality in GO annotations, showing that a small fraction of genes holds a disproportionate number of annotations. <em>Figure: Inequality in GO annotations has increased over time.</em> The Gini coefficient of the human GO annotation distribution rose from 0.25 in 2001 to \~0.47 by 2017<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19333-x?error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=694cfa95-5853-4a93-971b-f974138073d8#:~:text=Annotation%20inequality%20is%20increasing%20over,time">[17]</a>, indicating that annotation knowledge became more concentrated in a subset of genes. This bias can mislead researchers via a <em>“streetlight effect,”</em> where genes that are already well-annotated (and often well-known) are preferentially studied further<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19333-x?error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=694cfa95-5853-4a93-971b-f974138073d8#:~:text=We%20found%20tremendous%20inequality%20across,driven%20hypotheses">[18]</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19333-x?error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=694cfa95-5853-4a93-971b-f974138073d8#:~:text=Although%20GO%20includes%20predicted%20functional,studied%20genes%2035%2C10%20%2C%2037%2C12">[19]</a>. Haynes <em>et al.</em> warn that scientists tend to focus on genes with rich annotations rather than equally or more relevant genes with sparse annotations, simply because the former are easier to interpret<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19333-x?error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=694cfa95-5853-4a93-971b-f974138073d8#:~:text=We%20found%20tremendous%20inequality%20across,driven%20hypotheses">[20]</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19333-x?error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=694cfa95-5853-4a93-971b-f974138073d8#:~:text=Although%20GO%20includes%20predicted%20functional,studied%20genes%2035%2C10%20%2C%2037%2C12">[19]</a>. Over-annotation thus perpetuates a cycle: well-annotated genes get more attention and more annotations, while lesser-known genes remain under-characterized<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19333-x?error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=694cfa95-5853-4a93-971b-f974138073d8#:~:text=Although%20GO%20includes%20predicted%20functional,studied%20genes%2035%2C10%20%2C%2037%2C12">[19]</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19333-x?error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=694cfa95-5853-4a93-971b-f974138073d8#:~:text=inequality%20such%20that%20high%20coefficient,value%20indicates%20higher%20inequality17">[21]</a>. This can impede discovery, as novel or important genes might be overlooked. It also means that GO-based analyses may return very broad GO terms (e.g. “protein binding” or “cellular process”) that aren’t informative, or highlight processes that reflect generic biology (like metabolism or gene expression) simply because ubiquitous, multi-annotated genes are in the list. In summary, over-annotation can reduce the specificity and usefulness of GO analysis results, and it can give both human researchers and machine learning models a distorted view of biology – one dominated by a few superstar genes and overly general functions<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017258#:~:text=It%20is%20naturally%20of%20interest,into%20gene%20function%20or%20of">[22]</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19333-x?error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=694cfa95-5853-4a93-971b-f974138073d8#:~:text=We%20found%20tremendous%20inequality%20across,driven%20hypotheses">[18]</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-biological-process-is-most-affected">Why Biological Process is Most Affected</h2>
<p>The over-annotation problem is most pronounced in the <strong>Biological Process (BP)</strong> branch of GO, though it can occur in Molecular Function (MF) and Cellular Component (CC) as well. Biological Process terms are often multi-step pathways or broad outcomes (e.g. <em>“development,” “stress response,” “signaling pathway”</em>), and a single gene’s activity can be relevant to numerous processes. Curators historically sometimes annotated every process in which a gene was reported to have an effect. For example, a pleiotropic regulator might be annotated to dozens of BP terms ranging from cell cycle to apoptosis to metabolism, especially if mutant phenotypes were used as evidence for each process. Without careful restraint, the BP ontology can become a dumping ground for any observed consequence of altering the gene. In contrast, <strong>Molecular Function</strong> terms tend to be more discrete (enzyme activities, binding specific molecules, etc.), and a gene product usually has a limited number of molecular functions. It’s rare (and biologically suspect) for a protein to have 20 different molecular activities; thus MF annotations per gene are naturally bounded. <strong>Cellular Component</strong> annotations, similarly, are limited by the number of subcellular locations a protein resides in. A protein might localize to a few compartments or complexes, but it cannot be in every organelle. BP terms, however, can be very numerous because one gene can influence many pathways. Additionally, BP is where curators might inadvertently encode phenotypes – for instance, annotating a mouse gene to <em>“heart development”</em> because a knockout causes cardiac defects. GO now prefers such cases to be handled by phenotype ontologies (like the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology) for the phenotypic effect, and to only use GO BP if the gene’s mechanistic role in a developmental process is known. Nonetheless, legacy annotations and differing curator interpretations have made some genes, especially in model organisms, associated with long lists of BP terms.</p>
<p>This disparity is confirmed by studies of annotation distribution. Gillis and Pavlidis observed that the <strong>“most multifunctional” genes</strong> (those with the highest annotation counts) include many that are biologically central or heavily studied (e.g. <em>TP53, TNF, TGFB1</em>), and most of their plethora of annotations are in the BP domain<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017258#:~:text=It%20is%20naturally%20of%20interest,into%20gene%20function%20or%20of">[23]</a>. Many of those GO terms are high-level processes that these genes <em>appear</em> in due to widespread effects or broad research focus. By contrast, the number of distinct MF terms for a gene is usually much smaller – even TP53 essentially has a few known molecular functions (DNA-binding transcription factor activity, etc.), but dozens of process annotations. GO Consortium statistics also indicate that the BP ontology has grown larger and receives the most annotations. It is worth noting that <strong>over-annotation can occur in MF and CC as well</strong>, typically via automated methods. For instance, a protein with many predicted enzyme activities might get multiple MF annotations electronically (some of which could be incorrect). Or an overly zealous annotation pipeline might list a protein in every cellular compartment a GFP-fusion was ever observed, even transiently. However, GO curators have implemented quality control to limit this: terms like <em>“cellular component unknown”</em> are used when data is lacking, and extremely generic CC terms like <em>“cellular part”</em> are disallowed for direct use<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=1">[24]</a>. Overall, BP remains the area where curatorial discipline is most needed to avoid over-annotation, due to the temptation of capturing whole phenotypes or broad biological themes rather than the precise role of the gene product.</p>
<h2 id="curatorial-standards-and-quality-control">Curatorial Standards and Quality Control</h2>
<p>Improving annotation consistency is crucial to curbing over-annotation. The Gene Ontology Consortium has established <strong>best practices and rules</strong> to guide curators. One fundamental principle is: <strong>annotate to the most specific applicable GO term, and let the ontology’s structure imply the broader context</strong><a href="https://advaitabio.com/faq-items/understanding-gene-ontology/#:~:text=When%20annotating%20genes%20with%20GO,%E2%80%9Cinduction%20of%20apoptosis%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Capoptosis%E2%80%9D">[1]</a><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=experimental%20knowledge%20gained%20over%20time,could%20be%20interpreted%20that%20the">[25]</a>. This prevents redundancy. For example, if a curator has evidence that a protein kinase activates a specific pathway step, they should annotate “protein phosphorylation involved in [that process]” rather than separately annotating the kinase to generic terms like “signal transduction” and “phosphorylation” and “biological_process.” The latter broader terms would be automatically true via the ontology hierarchy once the specific term is in place. As GO evolves, the ontology often gains new granular terms to capture distinctions that were previously lumped into broad categories. Curators periodically <strong>revisit older annotations</strong> when new terms become available. A notable example was the apoptosis reannotation project: when GO added finer terms under <em>“apoptotic process,”</em> many gene annotations that were at the parent term were reviewed and moved to more specific terms reflecting the exact pathway (e.g. <em>“positive regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway via death domain receptors”</em>)<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=If%20we%20look%20at%20the,were%20not%20available%20at%20the">[26]</a><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=terms%20and%20therefore%2C%20a%20re,specific%20one%20could%20be%20made">[27]</a>. This kind of reannotation effort reduces over-annotation by ensuring we don’t keep a gene annotated to a broad term once a better one exists. Importantly, the original broad annotation wasn’t “wrong” – it adhered to GO’s true-path rule (if a gene is annotated to a child, it is implicitly annotated to all parents)<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=annotation%20to%20the%20less%20granular,of%20their%20proteins%20of%20interest">[28]</a>. But removing the redundant high-level term from the annotation file makes the gene’s profile more focused and informative. Users are thereby less likely to be misled by seeing an annotation to an overly general concept when a more precise one applies.</p>
<p>The GO Consortium also enforces formal <strong>annotation rules and checks</strong>. The GOC’s quality control pipeline includes a set of “GO rules” (implemented in validation tools like OWL reasoning and the Protein2GO curation interface) to catch common errors<a href="http://geneontology.org/docs/go-annotations/#:~:text=The%20GOC%20runs%20a%20number,For%20example">[29]</a>. For example, annotations must use valid IDs, have evidence codes and references, and cannot reference retracted papers<a href="http://geneontology.org/docs/go-annotations/#:~:text=The%20GOC%20runs%20a%20number,For%20example">[29]</a>. Some rules specifically target biologically inconsistent annotations, often via a curated <strong>annotation blacklist</strong><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Annotation%20blacklist">[30]</a>. The annotation blacklist enumerates certain gene–term combinations that should <em>not</em> be made because they are known to be biologically nonsensical or artifacts<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Annotation%20blacklist">[30]</a>. If an automated pipeline or even a human curator attempts to create such an annotation, the system flags or blocks it<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=The%20annotation%20blacklist%20allows%20us,populated%20from%20three%20sources%3A%201">[31]</a><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Function%20or%20Cellular%20Component%29,is%20publicly%20available%20as%20a">[32]</a>. For instance, if a mitochondrial protein were erroneously annotated to “nuclear envelope,” a blacklist rule might prevent that. This mechanism helps prevent some forms of over-annotation, especially those arising from erroneous ISS (sequence similarity) inferences across very different proteins. Another standard is to avoid annotating <strong>high-level process terms without specificity</strong>. We saw that GO marks certain terms like <em>“nuclear part”</em> or cell cycle phase terms as not acceptable for direct annotation<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=1">[24]</a>, and similarly terms like <em>“response to stress”</em> are disallowed for manual annotation due to being overly general<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Those%20that%20are%20inappropriate%20for,for%20all%20gene%20products%20annotated">[3]</a>. Curators are expected to always find a more specific child term (e.g. <em>“response to oxidative stress”</em> if the experiment describes peroxide treatment, rather than just <em>“response to stress”</em>)<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Those%20that%20are%20inappropriate%20for,for%20all%20gene%20products%20annotated">[3]</a>. These policies are part of curator training and are often enforced by annotation tools that show warnings if a disallowed term is chosen<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Those%20that%20are%20inappropriate%20for,not%20be%20possible%20to%20choose">[5]</a>. Additionally, evidence code usage is governed by guidelines to ensure appropriateness. For example, the <strong>IMP</strong> (inferred from mutant phenotype) evidence should support an annotation that is a plausible direct role of the gene, not just any phenotypic outcome. If an IMP experiment yields a very downstream effect, curators might use annotation extensions or simply not make a GO annotation if it falls outside GO’s scope of direct gene function<a href="http://geneontology.org/docs/go-annotations/#:~:text=,is%20located%20when%20the%20activity">[2]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-curator and cross-database consistency</strong> is also addressed through consortium efforts. Regular annotation jamborees, where curators from different model organism databases discuss tricky cases, help harmonize interpretations. The Alliance of Genome Resources (integrating FlyBase, MGI, SGD, WormBase, etc. with GO) has further improved consistency by sharing curation platforms and standards. Each new annotation (especially manual ones) goes through peer review by another curator or a project manager for accuracy and adherence to guidelines. Community feedback is encouraged too: researchers can report annotations they believe are incorrect or over-stated, and the GO consortium will review and correct them<a href="http://geneontology.org/docs/contributing-to-go/#:~:text=Suggesting%20revisions%20for%20existing%20annotations">[33]</a><a href="http://geneontology.org/docs/contributing-to-go/#:~:text=2,annotation%20team">[34]</a>. This openness helps catch cases where a gene might have been given an overly broad term historically.</p>
<h2 id="ongoing-initiatives-and-review-mechanisms">Ongoing Initiatives and Review Mechanisms</h2>
<p>To address over-annotation and improve annotation quality, the GO Consortium and broader community have launched several initiatives. One is the use of <strong>phylogenetic curation (PAINT and IBA evidence)</strong> not just to propagate annotations, but also as a <em>review mechanism</em>. In PAINT, curators examine a gene family tree annotated with experimental GO terms across species. This often brings to light inconsistencies: if one ortholog has a certain function but others in the clade do not, curators investigate whether the others truly lack that function or are just understudied. They can then propagate the annotation where appropriate, but also annotate a <em>NOT</em> for those that definitively don’t have the function<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Obsoleting%20terms%20from%20the%20ontologies">[7]</a><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=products%20that%20were%20associated%20with,accuracy%20of%20the%20resulting%20annotations">[8]</a>. This process can actually <em>reduce</em> over-annotation by ensuring that broad functions aren’t naively copied to every family member – each IBA (Inferred from Biological Aspect of ancestor) is added only if it passes the curator’s scrutiny. Moreover, as PAINT curators work, they occasionally spot original experimental annotations that seem odd or too general (for example, a species-specific annotation that doesn’t fit the pattern in related species), and they may flag those for review. Thus, the phylogenetic approach serves as a second layer of quality control across all GO annotations, refining them in an evolutionary context.</p>
<p>Another major development is the <strong>“Functionome” project (PAN-GO)</strong> for human genes. This recent effort, published in 2025, involved over 150 biologists consolidating knowledge about human gene functions using both literature curation and evolutionary modeling<a href="https://www.sib.swiss/news/sib-helps-create-most-complete-accurate-resource-for-human-gene-functions#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%2C%20biodata,published%20today%20in%20the%20journal%C2%A0Nature">[35]</a><a href="https://www.sib.swiss/news/sib-helps-create-most-complete-accurate-resource-for-human-gene-functions#:~:text=Developed%20by%20SIB%E2%80%99s%20Swiss,coding%20genes">[36]</a>. The PAN-GO functionome aimed to create a comprehensive, accurate set of functional annotations (and summary descriptions) for <em>all</em> human protein-coding genes, including those that were sparsely annotated before. By integrating data from model organisms and phylogenetic context, it <strong>assigned known functions to 82% of human genes</strong> – over 20,000 genes – up from the much smaller fraction that had direct experimental annotations in humans<a href="https://www.sib.swiss/news/sib-helps-create-most-complete-accurate-resource-for-human-gene-functions#:~:text=Researchers%20carrying%20out%20big%20data,and%20other%20computational%20data%20analyses">[37]</a><a href="https://www.sib.swiss/news/sib-helps-create-most-complete-accurate-resource-for-human-gene-functions#:~:text=Developed%20by%20SIB%E2%80%99s%20Swiss,coding%20genes">[36]</a>. This initiative is relevant to over-annotation in two ways: (1) it helps balance the annotation coverage so that lesser-known genes get some annotations (reducing the relative bias where only a few genes had tons of terms while many had none), and (2) it provides <em>expert-curated summaries</em> for each gene, which can help filter what the key functions are. In essence, the functionome project can highlight the <strong>most important, well-supported GO terms</strong> for a gene out of a long list. If a gene had 40 GO annotations but the functionome summary emphasizes the 5 core functions that are consistently supported across species, researchers can focus on those. The resource thus acts as a high-level review, potentially flagging annotations that might be spurious or of low confidence if they didn’t make it into the integrated summary. By combining computational prediction with human expert oversight, the functionome also likely identified cases of over-annotation (where a gene was annotated with a function that doesn’t actually hold up in comparative analysis) and corrected them. The fact that it’s <em>structured in a machine-readable format</em> means it can be used to improve bioinformatic analyses as well<a href="https://www.sib.swiss/news/sib-helps-create-most-complete-accurate-resource-for-human-gene-functions#:~:text=Researchers%20carrying%20out%20big%20data,and%20other%20computational%20data%20analyses">[37]</a> – e.g. algorithms can weight annotations by whether they are part of this high-confidence compendium.</p>
<p>There are also emerging tools leveraging <strong>AI and text mining</strong> to assist curation. For example, the <strong>ai4curation/ai-gene-review</strong> project (an experimental GitHub project) is exploring the use of large language models to automatically read papers and suggest GO annotations or reviews. While still in development, such tools could help flag potential over-annotation by comparing new literature statements with existing annotations. If an AI finds that a gene is being annotated to a process without clear support in text, it could alert curators to double-check. Additionally, GO Consortium members have discussed methods to use AI for consistency checking (for instance, detecting if two annotations for a gene appear contradictory or if a gene has an exceptionally high number of broad terms). The <strong>GO rules and ontology evolution</strong> described in the literature also represent ongoing housekeeping. The consortium regularly obsoletes terms that are prone to misuse or creates relations to infer annotations more sensibly<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20updating%20the,are%20used%20to%20create%20inferred">[38]</a><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=occurs%20in%20a%20specific%20subcellular,inferred%20from%20this%20ontology%20link">[39]</a>. For example, a prior link that inferred a BP annotation from an MF annotation (<em>sequence-specific DNA binding TF activity</em> implying <em>transcription, DNA-dependent</em>) was removed when it became clear not all transcription factors directly trigger transcription<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20updating%20the,are%20used%20to%20create%20inferred">[38]</a><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=annotations%20to%20Biological%20Process%20or,inferred%20from%20this%20ontology%20link">[40]</a>. That single ontology change automatically <strong>removed \~2,500 improper BP annotations</strong> that had been inferred across databases<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20updating%20the,process%2C%20or%20a%20process%20always">[41]</a> – essentially cleaning up a bulk over-annotation. This shows the consortium’s willingness to adjust the ontology structure to improve annotation quality.</p>
<p>Finally, community-driven projects like CAFA (Critical Assessment of Function Annotation) evaluate how well gene function prediction methods (many of which rely on GO) are doing, and in the process they highlight errors in the existing annotations. CAFA and similar efforts sometimes point out over-annotations or missing annotations as part of their assessments, giving the GO curators external feedback on where the knowledgebase might be over-stating or under-stating a gene’s functions.</p>
<h2 id="action-plan-to-fix-over-annotation">Action Plan to Fix Over-Annotation</h2>
<p>Addressing over-annotation in GO requires a multi-pronged approach focused on curation practices, tools, and researcher awareness. Below is an action plan summarizing steps to mitigate over-annotation and its effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strengthen and Enforce Curatorial Guidelines:</strong> Continue to train all GO curators in the principle of specificity – annotate to the most granular term supported by evidence, and avoid adding higher-level terms that don’t convey additional info<a href="https://advaitabio.com/faq-items/understanding-gene-ontology/#:~:text=When%20annotating%20genes%20with%20GO,%E2%80%9Cinduction%20of%20apoptosis%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Capoptosis%E2%80%9D">[1]</a>. Emphasize that curators should not “annotate the whole phenotype” or assign a gene to a process if the connection is indirect (e.g., a mutant screen should prompt mechanistic follow-up, not immediate broad annotations). Regular cross-checks and curator peer-reviews should be instituted, where curators audit each other’s annotations for unnecessary broad terms or redundant entries. Expanding the <strong>“not for direct annotation”</strong> term list (and keeping it updated in tools like QuickGO) will guide curators away from problematic high-level terms<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Those%20that%20are%20inappropriate%20for,not%20be%20possible%20to%20choose">[5]</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Curation Consistency and Audits:</strong> Establish periodic audits of genes that have unusually large numbers of annotations, especially in the Biological Process category. If a gene has, say, 30+ BP annotations, a review team should evaluate whether some of those are legacy broad terms that could be removed or consolidated. This could be facilitated by an <strong>automated report</strong> that flags potential over-annotation: for example, identifying genes where many annotations come from IMP evidence without a clear mechanistic link, or where multiple parent-child term pairs are co-annotated. The GO consortium’s annotation QC pipeline can be extended with rules to catch these patterns (some of this is already done via the annotation blacklist and ontology constraints<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=The%20annotation%20blacklist%20allows%20us,populated%20from%20three%20sources%3A%201">[31]</a><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=1">[24]</a>). Community input via the GO helpdesk or GitHub issues should be further encouraged for users to report suspect annotations<a href="http://geneontology.org/docs/contributing-to-go/#:~:text=Suggesting%20revisions%20for%20existing%20annotations">[33]</a><a href="http://geneontology.org/docs/contributing-to-go/#:~:text=2,annotation%20team">[34]</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhance Automated Checks:</strong> Leverage the power of <strong>AI and text mining</strong> to flag potential over-annotations. For instance, an NLP system could read the paper supporting an annotation and judge if the GO term is truly mentioned/supported or if the curator might have over-interpreted. The <em>ai-gene-review</em> concept could be developed into a tool that assigns a confidence score to each annotation by comparing it with literature context. Low-confidence, high-level annotations could then be queued for human review. This human-in-the-loop approach would harness AI to scale up oversight without replacing expert judgment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduce Annotation Redundancy:</strong> Technically, ensure that pipelines do not duplicate ancestor terms. If any GAF (Gene Association File) production step is still adding implicit parent terms explicitly, that should be stopped – one specific annotation is enough, thanks to the true-path rule. GO has already mostly eliminated explicit redundant annotations, but continued vigilance is needed, especially as groups integrate legacy data. When reannotating genes or ingesting annotations from external groups, incorporate a step to filter out any term that is an ancestor of another term already annotated to the same gene (unless there’s separate evidence that specifically supports the higher-level term under different conditions). This will keep annotation files leaner and more meaningful<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=terms%20and%20therefore%2C%20a%20re,specific%20one%20could%20be%20made">[27]</a><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=annotation%20to%20the%20less%20granular,of%20their%20proteins%20of%20interest">[28]</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focused Updates to Ontology and Annotations:</strong> Continue the targeted ontology development projects that create finer terms for complex processes (like the apoptosis, heart development examples<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=that%20have%20been%20done%20recently,personal%20communication">[42]</a><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=If%20we%20look%20at%20the,were%20not%20available%20at%20the">[26]</a>). Every such project should include a reannotation phase where existing annotations to the older broad terms are redistributed to the new specific terms. This both fixes over-annotation and prevents it from recurring (since curators can now choose the precise term). Likewise, when obsoleting terms that were misused, always provide guidance for reannotation so that curators don’t simply map an obsolete broad term to another broad term<a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=Obsoleting%20terms%20from%20the%20ontologies">[7]</a><a href="https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-3-4#:~:text=products%20that%20were%20associated%20with,accuracy%20of%20the%20resulting%20annotations">[8]</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Tools for Users:</strong> From the end-user perspective, develop analysis tools that are aware of the over-annotation bias. For example, GO enrichment software could implement a <em>“multifunctionality weight”</em> that down-weighs contributions from genes with very high annotation counts<a href="https://erminej.msl.ubc.ca/help/tutorials/multifunctionality/#:~:text=Multifunctionality%20,The">[43]</a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017258#:~:text=the%20gene%20with%20the%20most,By%20itself%2C%20this%20is">[11]</a>. In practice, some tools (like ErmineJ from the Pavlidis lab) already allow correction for gene multifunctionality to reduce false enrichments<a href="https://erminej.msl.ubc.ca/help/tutorials/multifunctionality/#:~:text=Multifunctionality%20,The">[43]</a>. Encouraging researchers to use these or incorporating such options in popular GO analysis packages will mitigate the impact of any remaining over-annotation. This goes hand-in-hand with GO’s efforts: as we clean the annotations, also educate users to interpret results with an understanding that genes with many annotations could skew results<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017258#:~:text=the%20gene%20with%20the%20most,function%20prediction%E2%80%9D%20since%20the%20ranking">[44]</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19333-x?error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=694cfa95-5853-4a93-971b-f974138073d8#:~:text=Although%20GO%20includes%20predicted%20functional,studied%20genes%2035%2C10%20%2C%2037%2C12">[19]</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Balanced Annotation Growth:</strong> The PAN-GO Functionome and similar initiatives should be extended to other species or updated regularly for human. By systematically covering more genes with at least some annotation (through evolutionary inference vetted by experts), we reduce the disparity where only some genes are heavily annotated. This addresses annotation <em>under</em>-representation which is the flip side of the over-annotation coin<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19333-x?error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=694cfa95-5853-4a93-971b-f974138073d8#:~:text=Annotation%20inequality%20is%20increasing%20over,time">[17]</a>. A more even annotation landscape (lower Gini coefficient) means analyses won’t always point to the same famous genes. It also spreads curator attention more evenly, hopefully preventing overzealous annotation of any one gene. The functionome project demonstrates a scalable way to add annotations in a controlled manner, and its results (like curated gene descriptions) can guide curators on which annotations are truly significant for a gene.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continual Monitoring and Feedback:</strong> Finally, treating the GO knowledgebase as a dynamic resource is key. The consortium should monitor metrics like the distribution of annotation counts per gene over time (the annotation inequality). If those metrics show that inequality is rising or a few genes keep accumulating terms, that’s a signal to investigate why – perhaps a new high-throughput method is dumping lots of annotations of varying quality. GO releases and NAR annual papers should report on annotation counts, and any unusual spikes in certain genes or terms should trigger a review. By maintaining this feedback loop, GO can catch over-annotation issues early. Engaging the user community via workshops on “best practices in using GO” will also raise awareness – many users have an intuition that <em>too many GO terms</em> per gene can be problematic, and now we can give them concrete guidance and improvements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, over-annotation in the Gene Ontology is a recognized challenge rooted in the complexities of biology and curation. By tightening annotation rules, using tools to aid consistency, and proactively reviewing annotations, the GO Consortium is addressing the issue head-on. The goal is a GO knowledgebase where each gene is described <strong>comprehensively but not inflationarily</strong> – capturing all its true functions and roles, but avoiding the noise of overly broad or unsupported terms. This will ensure GO remains a reliable, precise resource for decoding gene functions in the era of big data biology. With ongoing efforts like phylogenetic curation and the PAN-GO functionome, along with community vigilance, we can correct past excesses in annotation and prevent future over-annotation, leading to more meaningful analyses and discoveries in genomics.</p>
