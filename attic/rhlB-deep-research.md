# Introduction 
**Pseudomonas aeruginosa** PAO1 gene **rhlB** (locus tag PA3478) encodes the enzyme *rhamnosyltransferase chain B*, a key catalyst in rhamnolipid biosurfactant production ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show?id=109775#:~:text=Product)) ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=genes%20,rhlA%20promoter%20contains%20two%20inverted)). Rhamnolipids are glycolipids composed of one or two rhamnose sugar moieties linked to hydrophobic β-hydroxy-fatty acids ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=motility%20,11%20%2C%20%2013)). These molecules serve as important virulence factors and surfactants in *P. aeruginosa*, contributing to biofilm architecture, motility, and pathogenicity ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=motility%20,11%20%2C%20%2013)) ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=l,by%20converting%20two%20molecules%20of)). The **rhlB** gene is part of the *rhlAB* operon and works in concert with *rhlA* to synthesize monorhamnolipids, which can be further converted to dirhamnolipids by a separate rhamnosyltransferase (RhlC) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11359576/#:~:text=%28mono,It)) ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=%CE%B2,reductase%20specifically%20involved%20in%20rhamnolipid)). Below is a comprehensive overview of **rhlB** covering its biochemical function, subcellular localization, biological roles, disease relevance, protein features, expression regulation, evolutionary conservation, and Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, with supporting literature for each aspect.

## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanism 
**RhlB is a glycosyltransferase** that catalyzes the final step in monorhamnolipid biosynthesis. Along with its partner RhlA (encoded in the same operon), it constitutes *rhamnosyltransferase 1*, the enzyme system responsible for producing monorhamnolipid ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11359576/#:~:text=%28mono,It)). Specifically, RhlB transfers an L-rhamnose from a nucleotide-activated sugar donor (dTDP-L-rhamnose) to a lipid acceptor molecule, β-hydroxyalkanoyl-β-hydroxyalkanoate (HAA) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11359576/#:~:text=%28mono,It)) ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=%CE%B2,reductase%20specifically%20involved%20in%20rhamnolipid)). RhlA first supplies the HAA by condensing two β-hydroxyacyl-ACP molecules into the dimeric fatty acid moiety ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=and%20RmlD%20are%20responsible%20for,upstream%20of%20RhlA%2C%20converting%20one)). **RhlB then glycosylates this HAA**, linking one rhamnose unit to form a mono-rhamnolipid ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=%CE%B2,reductase%20specifically%20involved%20in%20rhamnolipid)). The mono-rhamnolipid can either serve as the final product or act as the substrate for RhlC (rhamnosyltransferase 2) which adds a second rhamnose to yield a di-rhamnolipid ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=%CE%B2,reductase%20specifically%20involved%20in%20rhamnolipid)). Consistent with this biochemical activity, *rhlB* has been annotated with *“transferase activity, transferring glycosyl groups”* (GO:0016757) and more specifically *“UDP-glycosyltransferase activity”* (GO:0008194), reflecting its role in sugar transfer using an activated sugar nucleotide ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=,ECO%3A0000259)) ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=Molecular%20Function%20%20,lipid%20glycosylation)). Enzymatically, RhlB’s function can be summarized as: 

```
dTDP-L-rhamnose + HAA (β-hydroxydecanoyl-β-hydroxydecanoate) 
―→ L-rhamnosyl-β-hydroxydecanoyl-β-hydroxydecanoate + dTDP
``` 

This reaction defines RhlB’s contribution to the rhamnolipid biosynthetic process. Transposon mutagenesis studies provided early experimental evidence for this function: mutants disrupted in *rhlB* (or *rhlA*) lost rhamnosyltransferase activity and failed to produce rhamnolipid, defects which were restored by complementation with the wild-type genes ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=Transposon%20Tn5,5%20kDa%29%20harbors%20a%20putative)). Furthermore, expressing *rhlAB* in heterologous *E. coli* hosts conferred the ability to synthesize active rhamnosyltransferase, directly confirming that these genes encode the enzyme for rhamnolipid formation ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=as%20measured%20by%20using%20rhlA%3A%3AlacZ,encoding%20genes%20have%20been%20identified)). These findings firmly establish RhlB’s molecular function in assembling glycolipid biosurfactants.

## Cellular Localization 
**RhlB is predominantly a cytosolic enzyme** associated with the inner cell environment, potentially interacting with the membrane. Bioinformatic analyses (PSORT) classify RhlB as a cytoplasmic protein (classification confidence “Class 3”) ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show?id=109775#:~:text=Subcellular%20localization)). Unlike RhlA which carries an N-terminal signal sequence for periplasmic export ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=genes%20,on%20a%20functional%20RhlR%20regulatory)), RhlB lacks a classic signal peptide and instead was predicted to contain two hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=genes%20,on%20a%20functional%20RhlR%20regulatory)). These putative transmembrane segments suggest RhlB may attach to the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane or form a membrane-associated complex with RhlA during lipid assembly ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=genes%20,on%20a%20functional%20RhlR%20regulatory)). The current understanding is that RhlA likely operates at the inner membrane (periplasmic side) to generate the HAA intermediate, while RhlB, possibly tethered to the membrane, transfers rhamnose to HAA either in the cytosol or membrane interface ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=genes%20,on%20a%20functional%20RhlR%20regulatory)). No experimental crystal structure is yet available to pinpoint topology, but AlphaFold modeling predicts RhlB to have a soluble globular structure typical of glycosyltransferases (see below), consistent with a mainly cytosolic localization. In summary, **RhlB functions at or near the cytosolic side of the inner membrane**, where it can access the nucleotide-sugar substrate from the cytoplasm and the lipid substrate produced by RhlA. This subcellular localization aligns with GO annotations like *“cytoplasm”* (GO:0005737) for cellular component, as supported by computational predictions ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show?id=109775#:~:text=Subcellular%20localization)).

## Biological Processes Involvement 
Through its enzymatic activity, **RhlB drives the biosynthesis of rhamnolipids**, linking it to several important biological processes in *P. aeruginosa*. Foremost, RhlB is central to the *glycolipid biosynthetic process* (a subset of lipid glycosylation), converting carbohydrate and fatty acid precursors into a complex glycolipid ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=and%20RmlD%20are%20responsible%20for,upstream%20of%20RhlA%2C%20converting%20one)). Gene ontology annotations accordingly include *“lipid glycosylation”* (GO:0030259) and *“carbohydrate metabolic process”* (GO:0005975), recognizing that RhlB’s action couples sugar metabolism with lipid metabolism ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=Biological%20Process%20%20,transferase%20activity)) ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=Molecular%20Function%20%20,ECO%3A0000259)). The rhamnolipid end-products of RhlB have diverse roles in *P. aeruginosa* physiology and pathogenesis. Notably, rhamnolipids are required for **surface-associated motility (swarming)** and **biofilm maturation**. By reducing surface tension and acting as wetting agents, rhamnolipids enable swarming motility across semi-solid surfaces and facilitate the spreading of biofilm colonies ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=l,by%20converting%20two%20molecules%20of)) ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=Separate%20mutations%20in%20both%20rhlA,clusters%20contribute%20to%20this%20phenotype)). They also contribute to biofilm architecture by helping form microchannels and by promoting the dispersion of cells when nutrients deplete, thus dynamically shaping biofilm development ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=l,by%20converting%20two%20molecules%20of)). Additionally, rhamnolipids aid in the **uptake of hydrophobic substrates** (serving as biosurfactants that emulsify hydrophobic compounds) ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=l,by%20converting%20two%20molecules%20of)), thereby broadening the range of nutrients *P. aeruginosa* can utilize. Another critical role is in microbial competition and stress tolerance: rhamnolipids can lyse competing microorganisms or disrupt membranes, contributing to **antimicrobial activity** in polymicrobial environments ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=are%20found%20in%20sputa%20of,11%20%2C%20%2013)). Importantly, RhlB and its product are integral to the *quorum sensing (QS) regulon* of *P. aeruginosa*. Rhamnolipid production is tightly cell-density-dependent, linking RhlB to the **quorum-sensing controlled processes** that coordinate group behaviors such as virulence factor production and biofilm formation ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC141836/#:~:text=The%20Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa%20rhlAB%20operon,s%7D%20dependent)) ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=l,by%20converting%20two%20molecules%20of)). Overall, **RhlB participates in multiple biological processes** – from secondary metabolism (glycolipid biosynthesis) to communal behaviors (biofilm structuring, swarming) – that collectively enhance the survival and pathogenic potential of *P. aeruginosa*. 

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes 
**RhlB and rhamnolipid production are directly associated with the virulence of *P. aeruginosa***. Rhamnolipids are well-documented virulence factors in human disease contexts, especially in chronic lung infections such as cystic fibrosis (CF). These glycolipids have been detected in the sputum of CF patients, indicating active rhamnolipid production in vivo during infection ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=motility%20,11%20%2C%20%2013)). Functionally, rhamnolipids contribute to pathogenesis by damaging host tissues and evading immune defenses. For example, rhamnolipids **disrupt the tracheal ciliary apparatus** in the respiratory tract, impairing mucociliary clearance in the lungs ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=motility%20,11%20%2C%20%2013)). This ciliary paralysis helps *P. aeruginosa* establish persistent infections in CF airways. Rhamnolipids also **inhibit phagocytosis and kill immune cells**: they can lyse polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, thereby protecting the bacteria from clearance ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=are%20found%20in%20sputa%20of,11%20%2C%20%2013)). Indeed, rhamnolipid was originally identified as the “heat-stable extracellular hemolysin” of *P. aeruginosa* due to its ability to lyse red blood cells ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=are%20found%20in%20sputa%20of,11%20%2C%20%2013)). The loss of rhamnolipid production (e.g. in an *rhlA* or *rhlB* mutant) severely attenuates bacterial resistance to immune attack – such mutants cannot form the protective biofilms or escape neutrophil-mediated killing as effectively as wild-type ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=are%20found%20in%20sputa%20of,11%20%2C%20%2013)). In a foreign-body infection model, an *rhlA* knockout (unable to produce any rhamnolipids) was cleared more readily by neutrophils, underscoring that rhamnolipids normally provide a shield against polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) predation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19594494/#:~:text=Inactivation%20of%20the%20rhlA%20gene,Among%20these%20are%20rhamnolipids)). Consistently, **mutations in the rhlAB operon reduce virulence in animal infection models**. For instance, *rhlB* is listed in virulence factor databases (e.g. VFDB, Victors) as a required gene for full pathogenicity, with mutant phenotype evidence showing reduced persistence in a rat chronic lung infection model ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show?id=109775#:~:text=Source%201%20Database%20%20,Victors%20%3A%204223)) ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show?id=109775#:~:text=Evidence%20%20,14641575)). Clinically, *P. aeruginosa* strains that overproduce rhamnolipids can cause extensive tissue damage, contributing to the severity of pneumonia, chronic wound infections, and bacteremia. Thus, RhlB’s activity – by furnishing rhamnolipids – underlies several **pathogenic phenotypes**, including biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance, immune evasion, and tissue injury. These associations highlight RhlB as a potential anti-virulence target, since inhibiting rhamnosyltransferase could disarm the pathogen’s protective surfactant and render it more susceptible to host defenses.

## Protein Domains and Structural Features 
**RhlB is a 426-amino-acid protein** belonging to the GT1 family of glycosyltransferases. It exhibits the characteristic two-domain architecture of *GT-B fold* enzymes, which consist of two similar Rossmann-like domains creating an inter-domain cleft for substrate binding ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=,4)). Sequence analysis reveals that RhlB contains an N-terminal domain (Pfam PF03033: glycosyltransferase family 28 N-terminal domain) and a C-terminal domain (Pfam PF00201: UDP-glucoronosyl/UDP-glucosyl transferase domain) ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=,4)). These domains are hallmarks of many **UDP-sugar dependent glycosyltransferases**, suggesting that RhlB binds the dTDP-L-rhamnose donor and the HAA acceptor in a cleft between its two domains. Like other L-rhamnose-transferases, RhlB’s sequence carries conserved motifs common to rhamnosyltransferases. Although the exact active-site residues of RhlB have not been experimentally determined, related enzymes often have a conserved DXH **catalytic motif** and an H(x)_nH motif that coordinate the nucleotide sugar binding ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11359576/#:~:text=contains%20consensus%20motifs%20that%20are,rhlC%20gene%20was%20located%20in)). RhlB’s closest characterized homologs (such as WapR and other rhamnosyltransferases in polysaccharide biosynthesis) share these signature sequences for rhamnose transfer, indicating a similar catalytic mechanism ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11359576/#:~:text=contains%20consensus%20motifs%20that%20are,rhlC%20gene%20was%20located%20in)). In support of its enzymatic role, RhlB has been classified in the CAZy database as a **glycosyltransferase family 1 (GT1)** member ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=,ECO%3A0000259)). This family encompasses inverting glycosyltransferases that typically use nucleotide-diphosphate sugars as donors. The tertiary structure of RhlB is predicted (by AlphaFold and homology models) to be consistent with this GT-B fold, having a bilobal structure with a deep pocket where the dTDP-L-rhamnose would bind adjacent to the lipid acceptor. Early hydropathy analysis noted two hydrophobic segments in RhlB’s sequence ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=genes%20,on%20a%20functional%20RhlR%20regulatory)), which may either form short transmembrane anchors or simply hydrophobic patches; regardless, these do not disrupt the overall soluble enzyme fold. No experimentally solved structure is yet available for RhlB, but given its domain composition and family, it likely adopts a stable globular conformation typical of UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=,4)). Key functional sites can be inferred by analogy to known structures: for instance, a flexible loop in the C-terminal domain (often carrying the DXH motif) might position the rhamnose donor, while a cleft accommodates the HAA tail. These **protein domain features** ensure RhlB can precisely recognize its unusual lipid substrate and catalyze glycosidic bond formation. 

## Expression Patterns and Regulation 
Expression of the *rhlB* gene is **tightly regulated by quorum sensing and growth-phase signals**. The *rhlAB* operon is under the control of the RhlRI quorum-sensing system: the transcriptional activator RhlR (with its autoinducer N-butyryl-homoserine lactone, C4-HSL) is required to induce *rhlB* expression ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC141836/#:~:text=The%20Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa%20rhlAB%20operon,s%7D%20dependent)). Upstream of *rhlA* (which is the first gene in the operon) are two inverted repeat “lux box” sequences that serve as RhlR binding sites, analogous to other QS-regulated promoters ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=as%20measured%20by%20using%20rhlA%3A%3AlacZ,Escherichia%20coli%20led%20to%20the)). Thus, as cell density rises and C4-HSL accumulates, RhlR-HSL activates *rhlAB* transcription, linking rhamnolipid production to the community’s quorum state ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC141836/#:~:text=The%20Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa%20rhlAB%20operon,s%7D%20dependent)). However, *rhlB* is not expressed immediately upon RhlR activation; notably, **its expression is minimal during exponential (log) phase**, even if RhlR and the signal are present ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC141836/#:~:text=1%2C%20which%20produces%20the%20biosurfactant,s%7D%20dependent)). Full induction of *rhlAB* occurs as cells enter stationary phase, suggestive of additional regulatory requirements such as stress or stationary-phase sigma factors ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC141836/#:~:text=1%2C%20which%20produces%20the%20biosurfactant,s%7D%20dependent)). In fact, RpoS (σ^S, the stationary-phase sigma factor) has been shown to be partially required for normal *rhlAB* expression ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC141836/#:~:text=autoinducer%20N,s%7D%20dependent)). The operon’s maximal expression correlates with nutrient limitation conditions. Experiments indicate *rhlB* transcription is enhanced roughly **20-fold under stationary phase and nitrogen-limited conditions** ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=domains,Escherichia%20coli%20led%20to%20the)), reflecting its role as a secondary metabolite gene turned on when rapid growth slows and resources (like nitrogen) become scarce. This regulatory pattern ensures rhamnolipid biosynthesis (which can be metabolically costly) is postponed until the population is dense and approaching nutrient limitation, where biosurfactants may confer a survival or dispersal advantage. Beyond RhlR and RpoS, other global regulators influence *rhlB*. The Las quorum-sensing system (LasR/3OC12-HSL) sits atop the hierarchy and activates *rhlR* expression, meaning *rhlB* is indirectly controlled by LasR as well ([europepmc.org](https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2997331#:~:text=1995%3B92%3A1490%E2%80%934.%20,Google%20Scholar)). Additionally, the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) and its regulators modulate *rhl* system output, and environmental factors like osmotic stress can affect *rhlB* expression through alternative pathways (e.g. via AlgU for *rhlG*, and possibly impacting rhlAB) ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=extra,not%20dramatically%20impair%20rhamnolipid%20synthesis)) ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa%20is%20a%20ubiquitous,Most%20of%20the%20rhamnolipid)). In summary, **rhlB expression is induced in late growth phase under quorum-sensing control**, integrating signals from RhlR/C4-HSL, the Las system, stationary-phase sigma, and nutrient status. This multi-layered control aligns rhamnolipid production with conditions where it is most beneficial for the bacterial community (biofilm maturation, nutrient scavenging, and evasion of host defenses).

## Evolutionary Conservation 
**RhlB is conserved in rhamnolipid-producing bacteria**, primarily within the Pseudomonas and Burkholderia genera. In *P. aeruginosa* strains, *rhlB* is highly conserved; for instance, the PAO1 gene PA3478 has orthologs in other *P. aeruginosa* isolates (like strain PA14) and related pseudomonads that produce rhamnolipids ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/rbbh/pairs#:~:text=Orthologs%20Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa%20PAO1%20,search%20between%20proteins%20found)). Comparative genomics shows that many environmental and clinical *P. aeruginosa* strains carry the *rhlAB* operon with very limited sequence divergence, reflecting the importance of this function for the species. Beyond *P. aeruginosa*, homologs of *rhlB* have been identified in certain *Burkholderia* species. Notably, the non-pathogenic *Burkholderia thailandensis* and the pathogenic *B. pseudomallei* each possess an entire rhl gene cluster (*rhlA-rhlB-rhlC*) ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=Orthologs%20of%20rhlA%2C%20rhlB%20and,fatty%20acid%20moieties%20with%20longer)). Intriguingly, these *Burkholderia* harbor two **identical paralogous copies** of the *rhl* cluster on their second chromosome, indicating a gene duplication or horizontal gene transfer event ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=pathogen%20B,surface%20tension%20of%20water%20to)). The *Burkholderia* RhlB proteins share significant sequence homology with *P. aeruginosa* RhlB, and the enzymatic function is preserved – *B. thailandensis* produces rhamnolipids (though with longer fatty acid chains) and in fact generates a higher proportion of dirhamnolipids than *P. aeruginosa* ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=single%20gene%20cluster,are%20responsible%20for%20the%20synthesis)) ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=spp.%20produce%20rhamnolipids%20containing%203,but%20one%20contributes%20more%20to)). Disruption of *rhlA* or *rhlB* in *B. thailandensis* abolishes rhamnolipid production and related phenotypes (like swarming motility), confirming the orthologs’ functional equivalence ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=rhamnolipids%20produced%20by%20B,clusters%20contribute%20to%20this%20phenotype)). Outside of *Pseudomonas* and *Burkholderia*, true *rhlB* orthologs are rare, as rhamnolipid biosynthesis is not widespread. Some other bacteria (e.g. certain *Marinobacter* or *Serratia* strains) produce glycolipid biosurfactants, but often via non-homologous enzymatic pathways. The presence of *rhlB* in both *Pseudomonas* and *Burkholderia* (genera that diverged significantly) suggests possible **horizontal transfer** of this operon or convergent retention due to adaptive value in environmental niches. Indeed, rhl gene clusters are thought to contribute to niche fitness by enabling hydrocarbon degradation and biofilm-based lifestyles, which could drive their retention across species ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=Rhamnolipids%20are%20surface%20active%20molecules,of%20rhamnolipids%20by%20Burkholderia%20species)) ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=have%20recently%20received%20renewed%20attention,11%20%2C%20%2013)). In evolutionary terms, RhlB is part of the larger family of NAD(P)-dependent glycosyltransferases present in diverse bacteria, but its specific activity with L-rhamnose and lipid substrates is a more specialized trait. Within its family, RhlB is most closely related to other rhamnosyltransferases involved in cell surface or extracellular glycolipid assembly (for example, enzymes adding rhamnose in O-antigen or polysaccharide synthesis share distant homology). In summary, **RhlB is evolutionarily conserved among rhamnolipid-producing bacteria**, with especially strong conservation in *P. aeruginosa* and closely related species, and functional counterparts present in *Burkholderia*. This conservation underlines the important ecological and pathogenic roles rhamnolipids play, which have been maintained by natural selection.

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature 
The discovery and characterization of *rhlB* have been underpinned by classic genetic and biochemical studies. Early work by Ochsner and colleagues used transposon mutagenesis to isolate *P. aeruginosa* mutants deficient in rhamnolipid production ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=Transposon%20Tn5,5%20kDa%29%20harbors%20a%20putative)). These mutants, which lacked rhamnosyltransferase activity and biosurfactant production, were complemented with cloned DNA from a wild-type library ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=activity%20have%20been%20isolated,5%20kDa%29%20harbors%20a%20putative)). This led to the identification of the *rhlAB* operon upstream of the quorum-sensing regulator *rhlR*, establishing the genetic locus for rhamnolipid biosynthesis ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=capable%20of%20restoring%20rhamnolipid%20synthesis,Moreover%2C%20the%20transcriptional)). The product of *rhlB* was inferred to be ~47 kDa, and sequence analysis immediately suggested a glycosyltransferase enzyme, while *rhlA* appeared to encode a 32.5 kDa protein with a secretory signal peptide ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=genes%20,on%20a%20functional%20RhlR%20regulatory)). Controlled expression of *rhlAB* in *E. coli* produced an active enzyme that could synthesize rhamnolipids, directly confirming the role of these genes in biosurfactant synthesis ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=as%20measured%20by%20using%20rhlA%3A%3AlacZ,encoding%20genes%20have%20been%20identified)). Subsequent research identified a second rhamnosyltransferase, *rhlC*, needed for di-rhamnolipid formation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11359576/#:~:text=%28mono,It)). The *rhlC* discovery (Rahim et al. 2001) reinforced the understanding of RhlB as the enzyme responsible for the first rhamnose transfer (mono-rhamnolipid) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11359576/#:~:text=%28mono,It)). On the regulatory side, seminal studies by Soberón-Chávez’s group demonstrated the quorum-sensing control of *rhlAB*: mutational analysis of *rhlR* and timed expression assays showed that RhlR and its cognate signal C4-HSL are required for *rhlB* induction ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC141836/#:~:text=The%20Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa%20rhlAB%20operon,s%7D%20dependent)). Medina et al. (2003) further revealed the growth-phase dependency of *rhlAB* expression, noting the lack of induction in log phase despite presence of QS signals ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC141836/#:~:text=1%2C%20which%20produces%20the%20biosurfactant,s%7D%20dependent)). This pointed to additional regulation by stationary-phase factor RpoS and possibly other environmental cues ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC141836/#:~:text=autoinducer%20N,s%7D%20dependent)). Key virulence studies have linked rhamnolipid production to infection outcomes. McClure and Schiller (1996) showed that purified rhamnolipids disrupt human respiratory epithelium and inhibit ciliary beating, explaining *P. aeruginosa*’s ability to paralyze lung clearance mechanisms ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=motility%20,11%20%2C%20%2013)). Jensen et al. and later Zulianello et al. (2006) observed that *rhlA/B* mutants are more readily cleared in mouse and rat infection models, due to loss of protection against phagocytes ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=are%20found%20in%20sputa%20of,11%20%2C%20%2013)) ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show?id=109775#:~:text=Database%20%20,14641575)). In vitro assays demonstrated rhamnolipid’s capacity to lyse neutrophils and macrophages, identifying it as a major factor in *P. aeruginosa* immune evasion ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-9-263#:~:text=are%20found%20in%20sputa%20of,11%20%2C%20%2013)). Additionally, biofilm research by Davey et al. (2003) found that *rhlAB* mutants form abnormal biofilms with altered structure, highlighting rhamnolipid’s role in biofilm maintenance and dispersal. More recently, structural biology and enzymology efforts have focused on RhlB and RhlC. While no crystal structure of RhlB is published to date, analogies to other glycosyltransferases and modeling (Jarvis et al., 2010) have provided insight into its active site. Mutagenesis of predicted catalytic residues (e.g., the putative DXH motif) has been used to confirm their importance for activity, supporting the proposed mechanism of inverting glycosyl transfer. On the applied side, there is growing interest in RhlB for biotechnology: engineers have introduced *rhlA* and *rhlB* into *Pseudomonas putida* and other hosts to produce rhamnolipids commercially ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6301282/#:~:text=,putida)). These heterologous expression studies further confirm that RhlB’s activity is both necessary and sufficient (with RhlA) for mono-rhamnolipid synthesis in diverse bacterial backgrounds ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=were%20based%20on%3A%20i,then%20reported%20that%20RhlG)). In summary, a rich body of literature – spanning genetics, biochemistry, infection biology, and biotechnology – provides **experimental evidence for RhlB’s function and importance**. The gene’s identification through loss-of-function mutants, its enzymatic confirmation via biochemical assays, and the phenotypic analyses of rhlB-deficient strains in virulence and biofilm models all strongly support its annotated roles in rhamnolipid production and bacterial virulence.

## Relevant Gene Ontology (GO) Annotations 
Given the above characteristics, the **Gene Ontology annotations** for RhlB reflect its role as a rhamnose-transferring enzyme in lipid metabolism and its association with cellular components. Key GO terms associated with RhlB include:

- **Molecular Function:** *transferase activity, transferring glycosyl groups* (GO:0016757) – RhlB catalyzes the transfer of a glycosyl (rhamnosyl) group to a lipid, a function supported by sequence similarity to known glycosyltransferases ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=,ECO%3A0000259)). It is more specifically annotated as *UDP-glycosyltransferase activity* (GO:0008194), indicating it uses a nucleotide-sugar donor ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=Molecular%20Function%20%20,lipid%20glycosylation)). Additionally, *transferase activity, transferring hexosyl groups* (GO:0016758) applies since rhamnose is a hexose sugar ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=Molecular%20Function%20%20,lipid%20glycosylation)).

- **Biological Process:** *lipid glycosylation* (GO:0030259) – RhlB participates in the enzymatic addition of a sugar to a lipid, i.e. the biosynthesis of a glycolipid (monorhamnolipid) ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=Molecular%20Function%20%20,ECO%3A0000259)). This is part of the broader *carbohydrate metabolic process* (GO:0005975) because it involves carbohydrate (rhamnose) utilization ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=Biological%20Process%20%20,transferase%20activity)). RhlB is also integral to *glycolipid biosynthetic process* (a term often used to describe pathways like rhamnolipid production) and is indirectly tied to *quorum sensing* (GO:0009372) and *biofilm formation* processes via its regulation and function ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=,23%2C%20Jan%2017)). 

- **Cellular Component:** *cytoplasm* (GO:0005737) – as a soluble (non-membrane or peripheral membrane) enzyme, RhlB is primarily localized in the cytoplasm or cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show?id=109775#:~:text=Subcellular%20localization)). If RhlB is membrane-associated, one could also consider *plasma membrane* (GO:0005886) or *periplasmic space* (GO:0042597) annotations, but experimental evidence favors a cytosolic localization for the enzyme activity ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show?id=109775#:~:text=Subcellular%20localization)). 

Each of these GO annotations is supported by experimental or sequence analysis evidence. For example, the transferase activity terms are backed by RhlB’s membership in CAZy glycosyltransferase family 1 and the rescue of rhamnosyltransferase function in mutants ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show/?id=109775&view=functions#:~:text=,ECO%3A0000259)) ([www.jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2817%2932089-6/fulltext#:~:text=as%20measured%20by%20using%20rhlA%3A%3AlacZ,encoding%20genes%20have%20been%20identified)). The lipid glycosylation role is evidenced by the characterized involvement of RhlB in rhamnolipid biosynthesis ([bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-14-160#:~:text=and%20RmlD%20are%20responsible%20for,upstream%20of%20RhlA%2C%20converting%20one)), and the cytoplasmic localization is inferred from proteomic and bioinformatic studies ([www.pseudomonas.com](https://www.pseudomonas.com/feature/show?id=109775#:~:text=Subcellular%20localization)). These annotations are crucial for gene ontology curation as they succinctly capture **RhlB’s function (glycosyltransferase), the process (rhamnolipid/glycolipid biosynthesis), and the location (cytosolic)**, all of which are well-supported by the literature.
